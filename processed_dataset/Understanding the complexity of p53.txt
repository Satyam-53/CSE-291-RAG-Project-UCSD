SUMMARY

p53 was discovered 45 years ago as an SV40 large T antigen binding protein, coded by the most frequently
mutated TP53 gene in human cancers. As a transcription factor, p53 is tightly regulated by a rich network of
post-translational modiﬁcations to execute its diverse functions in tumor suppression. Although early studies
established p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence as the classic barriers in cancer
development, a growing number of new functions of p53 have been discovered and the scope of p53-medi-
ated anti-tumor activity is largely expanded. Here, we review the complexity of different layers of p53 regu-
lation, and the recent advance of the p53 pathway in metabolism, ferroptosis, immunity, and others that
contribute to tumor suppression. We also discuss the challenge regarding how to activate p53 function spe-
ciﬁcally effective in inhibiting tumor growth without harming normal homeostasis for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Discovered in 1979, the p53 protein, encoded by the tumor pro-
tein p53 (TP53, or p53) gene, has captivated the attention of both
the cancer research community and the pharmaceutical indus-
try, positioning it the most extensively studied gene.1 Over the
past 45 years of research, p53 has consistently yielded both sur-
prise and excitement, albeit accompanied by persistent confu-
sions. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to understanding
p53. In return for this, we now have a better picture of this
gene (Figure 1). However, there are still certain aspects of p53
that remain unclear. In this review, we ﬁrst introduce the basic in-
formation about p53 and its regulatory mechanisms. We then
summarize the functions of p53 and its roles in both normal phys-
iological conditions and various pathological disorders, particu-
larly cancers. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic applications of
targeting p53 and the unaddressed issues in the p53 ﬁeld. Due to
space constraints, many original research papers and important
reviews on p53 could not be cited.

DISCOVERY, EVOLUTION, AND STRUCTURE OF P53

The study of p53 has experienced several pivotal twists and
turns over the past decades, mirroring the tortuous development
of oncology, characterized by signiﬁcant paradigm shifts.2–5 In
1979, the p53 protein was independently discovered by several
laboratories during research on cells transformed by simian
virus 40 (SV40) or through other methods.6–9 Initially, p53 was
believed to be an oncogene involved in cell transformation. How-
ever, in 1989, a series of papers revealed that wild-type (WT) p53
is, in fact, a tumor suppressor (Figure 1).2–5,10–14

The human p53 gene family comprises three members: p53,
p63, and p73. This family originated at least 800 million years

ago and followed by gene duplication and structural diversiﬁca-
tion.15,16 An intriguing discovery is that the p53 family gene is
present in some unicellular eukaryotes, such as the choanoﬂa-
gellate Monosiga brevicollis, suggesting its important role in
the evolution of multicellular organisms. The p53 family gene in
unicellular eukaryotes is believed to maintain genome stability
in response to various stresses. The p53 gene emerged in
the earliest vertebrates and has since been evolutionarily
conserved.15,16 The presence of p53 family in lower organisms
is remarkable, given their minimal risk of cancer. This raises a
question about the primitive role of p53 family in evolution. It is
possible that this family was initially involved in maintaining the
integrity of germline cells, with its well-known tumor suppression
capability emerging much later.

The p53 protein primarily functions as a transcription factor
(TF), although TF-independent activity has also been implicated
(Figure 2).15,17,18 The full-length p53 protein (FLp53) in human
comprises 393 amino acids, which are organized into ﬁve
different domains: the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD),
the proline-rich domain (PRD), the central DNA-binding domain
(DBD), the tetramerization domain (TD), and the C-terminal reg-
ulatory domain (CTD). The TAD of p53 is divided into two subdo-
mains TAD1 and TAD2.15,19 In unstressed cells, p53 protein
adopts a mixture of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric states,
with dimer predominating.20 Upon diverse types of stress signals
(including DNA damage, oncogene activation, ribosomal stress,
telomere erosion, nutrient deprivation, and hypoxia), the majority
of p53 proteins rapidly assemble into a functional tetramer
(a dimer of dimers) via its TD. By using the DBD, this tetramer
recognizes the p53 binding sites located at either the promoters
or enhancers of target genes to modulate transcription. Unlike
the well-folded DBD, whose structure has been solved, the
TAD and CTD of p53 are intrinsically disordered, facilitating their

interaction with cofactors for transcription mediation.15 These
two domains are also the major regions to undergo post-transla-
tional modiﬁcations (PTMs).21 The PRD also contributes to
the activity of p53.22 p53 is recruited to DNA via a speciﬁc
response element (RE) composed by two decameric repeats:
RRRCWWGYYY (R, purine; W, A or T; and Y, pyrimidine).23
p53 directly regulates the transcription of more than 300 target
genes. In view of the indirect targets, p53 is believed to mediate
the expression of several thousands of genes.24 Majority of the
reported targets are protein-coding genes, but p53 also regu-
lates various non-coding RNAs.25

REGULATION OF P53: PTM IS THE KEY

To accurately execute its multifaceted functions, the expression
and activity of p53 are subject to elaborate and multilayered
regulation at the protein, DNA, and RNA levels (Figure 2).23,26

Regulation of p53 at the protein level
The p53 protein can undergo many types of PTMs, including
ubiquitination, phosphorylation,
acetylation, methylation,
SUMOylation, NEDDylation, O-GlcNAcylation, ADP-ribosyla-

tion, UFMylation, hydroxylation, b-hydroxybutyrylation, sulfa-
tion, and isoLG adduction.21,27–29 Different stress signals deter-
mine the site and type of PTMs. Many PTMs of p53 are
reversible. The overall effect of PTMs on p53 includes altering
its protein level, cellular localization, cofactor recruitment,
target selectivity, and even protein aggregation.21,29,30 Among
these, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation are the
most common and inﬂuential in affecting p53 activity.

Ubiquitination typically occurs at the C-terminal lysine residues
of p53. Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is the most well-
known regulator of p53, ubiquitinating p53 to maintain low protein
levels in unstressed cells or to export nuclear p53 to the cyto-
plasm.21 Many stimuli and regulators activate p53 through allevi-
ating repression by MDM2.21 For instance, the p14ARF protein
can stabilize p53 via inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation of
p53. Convincing evidence supporting the importance of MDM2-
mediated p53 inhibition comes from mouse models, where the
MDM2 deﬁciency-caused embryonic lethality can be rescued by
deleting p53.31,32 Interestingly, MDM2 is itself a target gene of
p53.33 The MDM2-p53 feedback loop forms the core in p53-asso-
ciated pathways. MDMX (or MDM4), a family member of MDM2,
although lacking E3 ubiquitin ligase activity itself, can form a

Figure 2. Regulation of p53
The expression and activity of p53 are controlled by multilayered regulation at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. At the DNA level, SNPs (e.g., P72R) and
mutations (e.g., R273H) may occur in the p53 gene. p53 possesses two promoters, which can be methylated and silenced. The transcription of p53 gene is
activated or suppressed by various TFs (e.g., HOXA5). At the RNA level, the cellular localization, stability, and translation of p53 mRNA are modulated by RNA-
binding proteins (e.g., TIA1) and ncRNAs (e.g., miR-380-5p). p53 pre-mRNA and mRNA can undergo alternative splicing and alternative translation, respectively.
At the protein level, p53 folding, stability, cellular localization, DNA binding, transactivation ability, and target selection are primarily mediated by post-trans-
lational modiﬁcations (e.g., ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation) and cofactors (e.g., MDM2, MDMX, and CBP). Diverse stress signals (e.g., DNA
damage) can activate p53, and its activity as a TF is highly dynamic. p53 also exhibits TF-independent function in cytoplasm (e.g., promoting apoptosis via
interacting with Bcl-XL). P1 and P2, promoter 1 and 2; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; E3, E3 ubiquitin ligase; TF, transcription factor; Me, methylation; Ub,

heterodimer with MDM2 to enhance the degradation of p53. Other
E3 ubiquitin ligases that can degrade p53 include ARF-BP1/
HUWE1, COP1, CHIP, and Pirh2.21

Serine and threonine phosphorylation sites span across the
p53 protein. The phosphorylation of p53 by ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) represents the earliest mechanism demon-
strating how p53 responds to DNA damage.34,35 Phosphoryla-
tion at S15, T18, and S20 disrupts the binding and inhibition of
p53 by MDM2, while enhancing interaction with transcription co-
factors such as CREB-binding protein (CBP). As a result, p53-
mediated transcription is activated to induce cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis.36–38 Severe DNA damage further phosphorylates
p53 at S46, strengthening apoptosis.39

Acetylation of several lysine residues in the DBD is critical for
p53’s ability to activate key targets responsible for cell-cycle ar-
rest, apoptosis, senescence, ferroptosis, and mTOR inhibition in
a promoter-speciﬁc manner. The impact of p53 acetylation in tu-
mor suppression is best illustrated by a series of acetylation-
defective knock-in mouse models.40–46 For example, although
the p53-3KR mutant, retaining its DNA binding activity, fails to
activate the major targets such as p21 and PUMA critical for
the p53-3KR
cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence,
mutant mice are not tumor prone.41 However, further elimination
of its ability to regulate ferroptosis and the mTOR pathway by

p53-4KR and p53-5KR mutants recapitulates the loss of its tu-
function as observed in p53-null mice.43
mor suppressor
Notably, the role of acetylation in the CTD is complexed by the
fact that the same lysine residues are also modiﬁed by methyl-
ation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and NEDDylation, in addition
to acetylation. Thus, the CTD acetylation-defective mutant (p53-
6KR and p53-7KR) mice fail to show dramatic impact in tumor
suppression as these mutants eliminate both positive and nega-
tive effects on p53 function by different types of PTMs.45,46
Indeed, the acetylation-mimicking (p53-KQ) mutant mice show
substantial p53 activation in transcription and tumor suppres-
sion without increasing p53 protein levels, underscoring the
role of the CTD acetylation in vivo.42,44

Taken together, a gamut of the various PTMs cooperatively
orchestrate the activity of p53. A serious caveat is that, albeit
many PTMs are proven crucial for regulating p53 in vitro, the
in vivo functions might be more complex.21 Knock-in mouse
models serve as valuable tools for elucidating the functions of
speciﬁc PTMs in modulating p53 activity.

At the protein level, recruitment of cofactors is another impor-
tant parameter inﬂuencing p53 activity. p53 protein can bind to a
plethora of interacting partners, including both activators and re-
pressors, which profoundly affect its folding, stability, cellular
localization, DNA binding, transactivation ability, and target

selection.23,47 For example, a group of chaperone proteins regu-
late p53’s folding and stability.48–50 MDM2 and MDMX bind to
the TAD of p53 to restrict its transactivation activity, indepen-
dently of MDM2’s role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.51 Several tran-
scription regulators such as PBRM1, SET, and Dicer are able
to interact with p53 in an acetylation-dependent manner.40 The
components of the m6A methyltransferase complex, METTL3
and RBM15, interact with p53 to selectively modify the mRNAs
of a group of p53 target genes.52,53

The local chromatin structure and epigenetic state also play a
crucial role in dictating p53’s DNA binding and effective tran-
scriptional induction. In glioblastoma, BRD8 maintains a repres-
sive chromatin state by retaining histone variant H2AZ at p53
target loci, thus blocking p53 recruitment.54 TRIM24 simulta-
neously binds to p53 and unmethylated H3K4, impeding chro-
matin opening by p53.55 p53 can cooperate with other locally
bound TFs to establish an accessible chromatin state and boost
transcription.56

Regulation of p53 at the DNA and RNA levels
The modulation at the DNA and RNA levels substantially inﬂu-
ences the protein level of p53.26 p53 gene possesses two pro-
moters, which leads to alternative transcription initiation.57 The
promoter region of the p53 gene can undergo DNA methylation
and histone methylation, thereby impacting its transcription.58,59
Multiple TFs control the transcription of the p53 gene.26 The pre-
mRNA of p53 may undergo alternative splicing.60 Besides, the
stability, localization, and translation of p53 mRNA are all tightly
regulated.61–63

p53 activation is not a simple all-or-none mode, but a dynamic
process. The heterogeneity of cells,
the characteristic of
stresses, the aforementioned diversiﬁed regulatory factors, and
the stability of target genes together determine the dynamics
of p53 activity.23,64,65

VARIANTS, ISOFORMS, AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF P53

Besides the diverse regulatory means acting on WT FLp53, the
ﬁeld is further complicated by the presence of p53 variants
(including single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and mu-
tants), isoforms, and other family members (Figure 2).

p53 SNPs: Twins are different
The P72R polymorphism is the most extensively studied SNP of
p53. The P72 variant has a weaker ability to induce apoptosis
compared to the R72 variant,66 and thus is associated with a
longer lifespan but a higher cancer mortality than the latter.67,68
However, there is also report that people bearing the P72 variant
are less susceptible to HPV-associated carcinogenesis.69 Mice
carrying the R72 variant of p53 show a higher propensity for
metabolic dysfunction,70 yet they also exhibit increased rates
of embryo implantation in females.71 There are also several
ethnic-speciﬁc SNPs in the p53 gene that have implications for
disease susceptibility and treatment.72

p53 mutants: Guardian has a dark side
Beyond SNPs, the p53 gene undergoes other types of genetic
variation, such as deletions, and more commonly, mutations.
p53 is among the most frequently mutated genes in cancers,

ll

with over half of all cancers possessing a mutated p53 allele.
Missense mutation is the predominant mutation type of p53.
There are six notable hotspots for missense mutations: R175,
G245, R248, R249, R273, and R282, that all locate in the DBD,
accounting for nearly 30% of all missense mutations of p53.
Other sites with relatively higher incidences of missense muta-
tions include H179 and Y220.15,73,74 All missense mutations
affect the thermal stability of p53 to varying degrees. Generally,
missense mutations can be classiﬁed into contact mutations,
which maintain the overall conformation of p53 but impair DNA
binding (e.g., R248W and R273H), and structural/conformational
mutations, which signiﬁcantly alter the conformation and stability
of the DBD (e.g., R175H, G245S, and R249S), all disrupting p53’s
TF activity. R196, R213, R306, and R342 are major sites for
nonsense mutations.15,73,74 While most cancer patients acquire
p53 mutations in their somatic cells, a notable exception is seen
in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), who carry a germ-
line mutant p53 and have up to a 90% lifetime risk of developing
one or more cancers and 50% of them get cancer before 30
years old.75,76 Notably, normal somatic cells may also harbor
p53 mutations and other oncogenic mutations,77,78 raising the
question of whether these cells are predisposed to oncogenesis
under certain conditions.

The functional outcome of mutant p53 can be attributed to
three different effects as follows. (1) Loss-of-function (LOF):
mutant p53 loses the activity of WT p53. For example, p53 mu-
tants are often impaired in their ability to induce cell-cycle ar-
rest and apoptosis.79 (2) Dominant-negative effect
(DNE):
mutant p53 interferes with the function of any remaining WT
p53. In human pluripotent stem cells, mutant p53 confers an
advantage in accelerating self-renewal.80 However, this DNE
in normal tissues may not be as common as in cancer cells,
as the levels of mutant p53 in normal cells are often kept low,
similar to WT p53. (3) Gain-of-function (GOF): mutant p53 ac-
quires additional activities not observed by loss of WT p53,
typically through interaction with speciﬁc cofactors. The GOF
of mutant p53 is largely attributed to its accumulation to high
levels in cancer cells. For instance, mutant p53 can co-aggre-
gate with WT p53 and other tumor suppressors (such as p63
and p73).81,82 The p53 hotspot mutants gain anti-ferroptosis
activity to promote tumor growth.83,84 By modulating the
expression of pro-metastatic targets,
the p53 mutants are
able to enhance the metastatic potential of cancer cells in
different mouse models.83,85–88 Despite the overwhelming evi-
dence indicating the importance of the GOF of p53 mutants,89
one recent study showed that the LOF but not the GOF of p53
mutants is more critical under different experimental settings.90
Nevertheless, categorizing p53 mutations into only one of these
three effects is over-simplistic and whether the GOF or the LOF
plays a more dominant role in vivo is likely context-dependent.
It is clear that the overall outcome induced by p53 mutations
results from the combination of all the three effects described
previously.

p53 isoforms: One root, many branches
Beyond FLp53, the p53 gene can produce other protein iso-
forms, resulting from promoter selection, alternative splicing,
alternative translation, and even post-translational cleavage
of FLp53.57 Attributable to combinations of
four distinct

Figure 3. Functions and physiopathological roles of p53
p53 exhibits diverse and complex functions: classical functions (including inducing cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, and maintaining genome
stability) and other functions (such as mediating metabolism, ferroptosis, stem cell dynamics, cell competition, metastasis, and immunity). Due to its wide array of
functions, p53 plays a crucial role in numerous physiological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, regeneration, repair, and aging) and pathological
disorders (like neurodegenerative disease, radiation sickness, chemotherapeutic toxicity, ischemic injury, metabolic disease, and cancer). The black curves
illustrate how speciﬁc functions of p53 contribute to its role in linked physiological or pathological processes.

N-termini (ATG1, D40, D133, and D160) and three different
C-termini (a, b, and g), there are twelve canonical
isoforms
of the p53 protein. The expression of these isoforms depends
on the isoform type, developmental stage, tissue type, and is
also subject to various regulatory mechanisms. These iso-
forms may possess unique activities, with the N-terminal iso-
forms being better investigated than the C-terminal ones.
Particularly, they are often dysregulated in different cancers.57
For example, D40p53 suppresses tumor cell growth,91 while
D160p53 can cooperate with mutant p53 to facilitate tumori-
genesis.92

p63 and p73: Siblings stand together
p53 shares high structural similarity with p63 and p73, espe-
cially in the DBD. Yet they also show differences in structure.15
These structural features result in both shared and distinct
functions among the three proteins. Both p63 and p73 are
able to regulate a number of well-known p53 targets,93 and
exhibit tumor suppression activity.94 Compared to p53, p63
and p73 have more roles in germ cell protection, fertility main-
tenance, and development regulation.16,95 For instance, p63
knockout (KO) mice exhibit defects in limb, craniofacial, and
epithelial development, while p73 KO mice display neurological
abnormalities.95

FUNCTIONS OF P53: DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY

p53 regulates a vast range of functions, constituting the complex
p53 network (Figure 3).96

Cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, and genome
stability
The inductions of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence
are among the earliest discovered functions of p53.2 Various
stress signals can induce p53 to exert these functions, with
DNA damage being the most potent trigger. Upon DNA damage,
p53 is stabilized and activated to arrest the cell cycle, providing
cells with a time window and adequate material and energy
spared from cell cycle progression to repair damaged DNA. If
the damage is too severe to repair, apoptosis and senescence
will be elicited by p53 to eliminate the compromised cells.
Notably, the outcome of p53 activation is also determined by
the type of cell and DNA damage. These three activities
are well accepted as the major barriers to prevent tumorigenesis.
On the other hand, failure to eliminate the damage cells leads to
genomic instability. The loss of p53, including loss of heterozygos-
ity (LOH) and biallelic inactivation or deletion, promotes genomic
instability and drives the evolution of the tumor cell genome.97–99
p53 is well known as ‘‘guardian of the genome,’’100 thus a highly

relevant activity of p53 is to directly promote DNA damage repair.
Indeed, a number of p53 targets have been identiﬁed to contribute
to the DNA repair process.101,102 Nevertheless, it remains unclear
whether p53-mediated activation of those DNA repair-related tar-
gets is sufﬁcient to suppress tumorigenesis independent of other
p53 activities.

Metabolism and ferroptosis
p53 is a master regulator in modulating metabolism of glucose,
lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, iron, and redox processes. It
also regulates autophagy and has broad crosstalks with key
metabolic regulators such as AMPK, AKT, and mTOR.103 This
function of p53 links it to several metabolic disorders, especially
cancers. In general, p53 represses anabolic processes (such as
de novo lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis), while promotes
catabolisms (including oxidative phosphorylation, lipolysis, and
fatty acid oxidation). The enhanced glycolysis generates multiple
molecular materials for biosynthesis in cancer cells and thus is
inhibited by p53 as well.103 These activities of p53 counteract
the rapid proliferation requirements of cancer cells, thus leading
to tumor suppression.

However, p53 manifests bidirectional roles in many metabolic
processes. This paradoxical activity lies in the context-dependent
nature of p53 function.96,104 The role of p53 in reactive oxygen
species (ROS) control provides a good example. When there is
a low intensity of ROS (indicating mild, transient, tolerable, and
mitigable stresses), p53 plays an anti-oxidative role to reduce it
to safeguard the cell from damage (pro-survival). On the contrary,
when ROS levels are excessively high and potentially cause un-
controllable damage (representing severe, prolonged, detri-
mental, and unrelievable stresses), p53 further intensiﬁes the
ROS, leading to cell death and limiting harm in the damaged cells,
thus protecting nearby undamaged cells (pro-death).47,103,105

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death
that occurs upon excess levels of lipid peroxidation, tightly linked
with metabolic pathways. Several metabolic targets of p53
including SLC7A11, VKORC1L1, GLS2, and PLTP are directly
involved in modulating ferroptosis.106–111 Similar to apoptosis
during the DNA damage response, ferroptosis is able to elimi-
nate the severe damaged cells during metabolic stress.112 By
using acetylation-defective p53 mouse models, p53-mediated
ferroptosis is implicated as an important arsenal in tumor sup-
pression41,43 and interestingly,
in p53-mediated
ferroptosis caused by an African-speciﬁc p53 SNP impairs its tu-
mor suppressive function.113 Unlike apoptosis, initiation of ca-
nonical ferroptosis often relies on the treatment of cells with fer-
roptosis inducers, such as GPX4 inhibitors. It remains unclear
whether ferroptosis-dependent tumor suppression requires fer-
roptosis inducers in vivo. Notably, a recent study showed that
PHLDA2-mediated phosphatidic acid peroxidation triggers a
non-canonical ferroptotic response in the absence of common
ferroptosis inducers.114 Since p53 is able to promote both ca-
nonical and non-canonical ferroptotic processes, it will be inter-
esting to examine which ferroptotic pathway plays a more domi-
nant role in p53-mediated tumor suppression.

the defect

Stem cell dynamics and cell competition
Stem cells share many similarities with cancer cells, including sus-
tained proliferative ability, reprogrammed metabolism, and the

ll

core transcription network. Therefore, it is not surprising that p53
restricts the cell stemness and modulates cell fate in various types
of stem cells.115,116 In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), p53 inhibits
genes that maintain stemness while activating those related to dif-
ferentiation.117,118 In diverse types of adult stem cells (ASCs), p53
represses self-renewal, promotes depletion, maintains quies-
cence, or stimulates the differentiation.116 The ability of p53 to limit
stemness is critical to its tumor suppression function, as it impedes
the formation of cancer stem cells.119,120 Speciﬁc differentiation
route guided by p53 contributes to tumor suppression in lung can-
cer.121 Loss or mutation of p53 may cause dedifferentiation, cell re-
programming, and increased cellular plasticity in cancers.122,123
The course of generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) re-
sembles dedifferentiation and cell transformation. p53 serves as a
major brake in this process, and silencing p53 greatly improves the
efﬁciency of iPSC generation.124,125

Cell competition is vital in development, tissue injury repair, tu-
mor evolution, and metastasis. Generally, as p53 inhibits anabo-
lism and proliferation while promoting cell death, which are not
beneﬁcial for cell to outcompete neighboring cells, a high level of
p53 activity often marks a ‘‘loser’’ cell state in cell competition.126
However, there is a study that reports p53 activity is required
for supercompetitor cells to eliminate nearby normal cells in
Drosophila.127 The regulation of cell competition by p53 has signif-
icant physiological implications.128–131 Cells harboring mutant p53
may undergo clonal expansion, potentially driving tumor initiation
and evolution.80,132,133 However, these p53 mutant cells are not al-
ways retained, as they may experience necroptosis by competing
with nearby normal cells, or be outcompeted by cells with muta-
tions in other genes that confer higher ﬁtness.134,135

Metastasis
p53 suppresses metastasis at its multiple stages and in both
cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners.136 In tu-
mor cells, p53 restricts their mobility and epithelial-mesen-
chymal transition (EMT) process.136 Metastatic cancer cells in
circulatory system may undergo anoikis and ferroptosis, both
of which are promoted by p53 to prevent cancer cell migration
to new sites.106,136 At each step of metastatic spread, cancer
cells adopt specialized metabolic programs to meet their energy
and biomolecular requirements, which can be counteracted by
p53.103,137 On the other hand, p53 shapes a tumor microenviron-
ment (TME) that is unfavorable for metastasis. For example, p53
restrains the angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, blocking the
main metastatic routes via blood and lymphatic systems.138,139 It
also maintains the integrity of extracellular matrix and enhances
tumor cell adhesion to it, limiting tumor cell movement.140 More-
over, p53 hinders pro-metastatic inﬂammation.141

Immunity
Another essential
function of p53 is to regulate immune
response. p53 functions in both innate and adaptive immunity
through multiple mechanisms.142,143 Both p53 in tumor cells
and non-tumor cells synergize to construct a tumor-suppressive
immune network. In tumor cells, p53 indirectly represses PD-L1
expression by upregulating miR-34, sensitizing tumor cells to
anti-tumor immune response and immunotherapy.144 p53 acti-
vates cGAS-STING pathway to induce anti-tumor activity.145 In

induces tumor cell senescence, triggering the release of inﬂam-
matory cytokines and eliciting an innate immune response to
eliminate tumor cells.146

In hepatic stellate cells, p53-induced senescence also exhibits
a tumor-suppressive effect in liver cancer, establishing a senes-
cence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that bolsters
M1 macrophage polarization to maintain a tumor-inhibitory
TME.147,148 In a subtype of murine myeloid precursor cells, p53
drives their differentiation into Ly6c+CD103+ monocytic anti-
gen-presenting cells, enhancing anti-tumor immunity.149

Loss of p53 in tumor cells or TME cells signiﬁcantly reverses
the tumor-suppressive immune microenvironment to an immu-
nosuppressive condition, promoting the immune tolerance or
escape of tumor cells, or establish an inﬂammatory environment
conducive to tumor metastasis.150,151 Mutant p53 may stimulate
tumor cell immune evasion,143,152 and intriguingly, p53 mutants
themselves can generate neoantigens that may be novel immu-
notherapeutic targets.153–155

p53 participates in autoimmune responses and immune de-
fenses against various pathogens as well.142,156 Noteworthily,
not all immunity-related activities of p53 promote immune cell
function or are beneﬁcial to health. p53 may inhibit the prolifera-
tion and function in certain T cell subtypes.157,158 For instance,
p53 suppresses antigen-nonspeciﬁc CD4+ T cell proliferation,
a process that can be abolished by T cell receptor (TCR)
signaling.158 Some viruses rely on p53 activity for cell-cycle ar-
rest and replication.156

Rethinking the multitudinous functions of p53
p53 is such a powerful regulator with an array of diverse and
complex functions that summarizing its roles in just a few words
is challenging. These functions are intricately orchestrated by
this single protein to achieve a uniﬁed biological purpose. Simpli-
ﬁed expressions are often used to describe the working model
of p53, such as ‘‘guardian of the genome,’’100 ‘‘protector or
killer,’’47 and ‘‘pro-survival or pro-death.’’159 The working mode
of p53 originates from the protection of germ cells by the ances-
tral p53 gene in lower organisms.160 Human p53 plays a similar
protective role in somatic cells. In the majority of species ex-
pressing p53 or p53-like gene, this gene is essentially a stress-
responder, but not merely a tumor suppressor. Therefore, p53
could also be called the ‘‘guardian of the cell’’.21 The tumor-sup-
pressive role of p53 may be considered coincidental, as some of
its guardian functions are inherently antagonistic to many cancer
cell characteristics. Thus, p53’s normal activity incidentally re-
presses tumor initiation and development.

P53 IN PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY: GUARDIAN IS
AN ALL-ROUNDER

Due to its myriad functions, p53 is involved in a multitude of bio-
logical processes in normal physiology. However, both normal
and dysregulated p53 activity also contribute to various disor-
ders (Figure 3).

(LIF), a key cytokine for implantation, in the uterus. Lower LIF
levels in p53-null female mice cause impaired implantation.162
In women under 35 with infertility, the P72 variant of p53, which
has a weaker transactivating effect on LIF, is overrepresented,
suggesting a positive correlation between p53 activity and im-
plantation rate.71

p53’s regulation of development is rooted in its pivotal roles in
the cell cycle, cell death, stem cell dynamics, and cell competi-
tion.116 p53 maintains genomic integrity in stem cells of embryo,
promote differentiation, and permit normal development.116 The
activity of p53 in early development must be kept in check, as
evidenced by that deregulated p53 (loss, hyperactivation, or mu-
tation) is linked to a variety of developmental defects in mice and
humans.163,164 p53 also functions in distinct types of ASCs to
maintain proper tissue hierarchy by protecting their integrity,
holding them in dormancy, ﬁne-tuning differentiation route, pre-
venting unlimited proliferation, unordered differentiation, and
dedifferentiation, plus suppressing tumorigenesis.116 p53 also
plays a role in tissue regeneration.165 A recent study reported
that p53 facilitates alveolar regeneration by regulating AT1 differ-
entiation.121 As the wound healing course has many similarities
with metastasis, p53 is supposed to impede it.166

Theoretically, p53’s activity has both pro-aging and anti-aging
effects. On one hand, p53-mediated stress (particularly the DNA
damage, a key driver of aging) response supports cell survival,
removes damaged cells, protects tissue integrity, and maintains
organismal homeostasis, potentially delaying aging. However,
excessive and persistent DNA damage response by p53 has
the opposite effect on aging.167 On the other hand, stem cell
depletion by p53 accelerates aging process,38,168 yet there are
counter-examples.169,170 Furthermore,
functions of p53 in
modulating senescence, metabolism, immune activity, and its
interplay with sirtuins are also related to aging mediation.171,172
The relationship between p53 activity, tumor suppression, and
aging has been investigated in different mouse models and little
consensus has reached, which may stem from the highly
context-dependent nature of p53’s function.170,173–177 Insights
into the relationship between p53, cancers, and aging may be
gleaned from studying animals other than mice.178 A notable
example is the elephant, which has twenty copies of the p53
gene and exhibits a low tumor incidence along with a long life-
span.179 More efforts are required to dig out the role of p53 in ag-
ing, hoping to develop interventions that could better balance tu-
mor suppression with aging, or possibly achieve longevity with a
reduced incidence of tumors.

Neurodegenerative disease
p53’s role in aging regulation is closely related to its function in
various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).180–183 The p53
protein level
is often elevated in these disorders. Primarily,
p53 contributes to NDD pathology by inducing apoptosis.
Recently, ferroptosis has been recognized as playing a signiﬁ-
cant role in NDDs.184 As a master regulator of ferroptosis,106 it
is logical to speculate that p53 participates in NDD progression
via regulating ferroptosis. Additionally, p53 protein aggregation
is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease.185 When developing drugs
targeting p53 pathway for cancer treatment or slowing aging
in elder people,
the impact of p53 on NDDs should be
considered.

Figure 4. p53 and cancer hallmarks
Activity of WT p53 antagonizes all the hallmarks of cancer, as depicted in the surrounding ovals. In contrast, alterations in p53, including repression, mutation, and
deletion, promote these hallmarks. It is partially adapted from a study by Hanahan and Weinberg.195

Radiation sickness, chemotherapeutic toxicity, and
ischemic injury
Exposure to radiation and genotoxic reagents, whether acci-
dental or as part of cancer treatment, activates p53-dependent
apoptosis and ferroptosis, causing pathologies in various or-
gans.106,186 Particularly, this mechanism underlies major side ef-
fects in tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy.187,188 Upon gen-
otoxic stresses, the presence of p53 is not always harmful. The
response of p53 to radiation is tissue-speciﬁc; while it stimulates
radiation-related cell death in hematopoietic system, hair follicle,
and spinal cord, it offers a radioprotective effect on gastrointes-
tinal tract.186,189 Similarly, apoptosis and ferroptosis promoted
by p53 lead to ischemic injuries in organs such as brain (e.g.,
stroke), kidney (e.g., kidney transplantation), and heart (e.g.,
myocardial infarction).106,186

Metabolic disease
p53 plays a complicated role in diverse metabolic diseases,
including obesity, diabetes, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty
liver diseases (AFLD and NAFLD), and cardiovascular dis-
eases.103,190,191 Its multifaceted activities, particularly in meta-
bolic regulation, affect these disorders in different cells, tissues,

and organs, such as pancreatic b-cell, liver, muscle, and adipose
tissue. Contradictory results are often reported about functions
of p53 in these diseases. For example, while p53 in skeletal mus-
cle progenitor cells and agouti-related peptide neurons protects
against obesity,192,193 the liver R72 variant of p53, with enhanced
transactivation ability, promotes fat accumulation and NAFLD.70
Besides, in endothelial cells p53 exacerbates dietary obesity-
related metabolic abnormalities.194 Hence, when discussing
the function of p53 in systemic metabolism and associated
metabolic diseases, it must be put into a speciﬁc setting. Care
must be taken when targeting p53 to treat certain metabolic dis-
eases to avoid disrupting other metabolic processes and mini-
mize the risk of predisposing recipient cells to cancer.

Cancer
As previously mentioned, p53 possesses an arsenal of functions
to combat all the hallmarks of cancer,195 which may be lost or
reversed due to its mutation, deletion, or repression in cancer
cells (Figure 4).

While a mutation in one p53 allele may be sufﬁcient for cellular
transformation when the other WT p53 allele remains intact,196,197

mutations are not entirely clear. Some may result from environ-
mental and chemical carcinogens such as ultraviolet radiation,
aﬂatoxin, and tobacco smoke, which leave characteristic ﬁnger-
prints on the p53 gene.73,198 The frequency and spectrum of
p53 mutations are dictated by factors such as gender, tissue
type, and both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mech-
anisms in tumor evolution.199–203 In addition, the timing of p53 mu-
tations varies among different tumors.198 Even within the same tu-
mor type, different p53 mutants may not lead to the same
phenotype.204 As introduced before, mutant p53 promotes tumor
development via LOF, DNE, and GOF, which are well-elucidated
in mouse models.79,196,197 While extensive focus has been placed
on p53 hotspot mutations, other mutations should not be over-
looked. For instance, missense mutations disrupting p53 oligo-
merization can lead to tumorigenesis.205,206 Missense mutations
in the PRD of p53 may potentially impact its tumor-suppressive
functions.207 Serum antibodies against mutant p53, immunohisto-
chemistry of mutant p53, and DNA fragments of mutant p53 in tu-
mor cells or body ﬂuids and feces can be used as diagnostic and
prognostic biomarkers in tumor patients.198,208–211 p53 mutations
also act as predictors for the efﬁcacy of certain tumor treatments
and are useful for patient stratiﬁcation.212

The p53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17
(17p13.1), a region frequently deleted in tumors. p53 loss
promotes tumor growth and metastasis in many different
ways.97,98,123,151,213 p53 deletion is often linked with the loss of
nearby genes, such as POLR2A and EIF5A, which also contrib-
utes to tumorigenesis and creates therapeutic vulnerabilities by
targeting the co-deleted genes.214,215

As p53 mutation and deletion have signiﬁcant impact on
carcinogenesis, mutating or deleting p53 have been effectively
applied to generate various mouse tumor models.196,197,216,217
A tightly relevant question is, among the LOF, DNE, and GOF
of p53 alteration, which is the predominant mechanism under-
pinning p53-related tumor initiation and progression? While
GOF of p53 mutants has garnered plenty of evidence support-
ing its tumorigenic role,218 there are also studies suggesting
that LOF and DNE contribute more to cell

to clarify this issue. The answer
is likely highly context-
dependent.

A notable percentage of tumors retain two intact WT p53 al-
leles. These tumors may use different methods to attenuate
p53 activity and its associated pathway. A common way is to
enhance inhibition of p53 protein level, nuclear import, promoter
recruitment, and transactivation activity by upregulating its
negative regulators.54,63,221 The ampliﬁcation of the MDM2
gene in sarcoma and glioblastoma is a notable example.221,222
Besides ampliﬁcation, the T309G SNP of MDM2 and deletion
of p14ARF both enhance repression of WT p53 by MDM2 in
tumors.221,223,224 Many oncogenic viruses (such as SV40,
Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus [KSHV]) transform cells partially by inactivating
p53.221 Sometimes, WT p53 is misfolded into a pseudo-mutant
conformation due to multiple mechanisms.74 In addition to inhib-
iting p53 directly, disruption of p53 downstream effectors also
impairs the tumor-suppressive effect of WT p53.225

954 Cancer Cell 42, June 10, 2024

Review

Although p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor, sporadic re-
ports indicate that under certain circumstances, WT p53 activity
may facilitate tumorigenesis and tumor survival. This can occur
in the precancerous stage226 and during tumor growth.227–230
Activation of WT p53 may also impair the efﬁcacy of tumor treat-
ment, promote resistance to anti-tumor drugs, and cause tumor
relapse.231–234 These cases stem from the hijacking of one or
more functions of p53 by precancerous or tumor cells to survive
and develop. Correspondingly, some bona ﬁde p53 target
genes, such as MDM2 and TIGAR,235,236 can function as onco-
genes. Hence, p53 should not be seen as a stereotypical tumor
suppressor, but as a context-dependent guardian of the cell.

The list of disorders inﬂuenced by p53 extends to some other
diseases. Taken together, beyond its most famous function in
cancer, p53 is a highly health-relevant gene in both normal phys-
iology and pathology (Figure 3). Health is achieved by maintain-
ing the body’s homeostasis, which is a dynamic and balanced
process. As a major stress-responder, p53 guards cellular ho-
meostasis against various stresses. However, its activity can
have both positive and negative effects on health and should
be kept in equilibrium. Both insufﬁcient and excessive p53 activ-
ities can disrupt a healthy state. Hence, the double-edged power
of p53 should be seriously and carefully considered in health pro-
motion and disease treatment strategies targeting p53.

TARGETING P53 FOR DISEASE TREATMENT: ALL
ROADS LEAD TO HEALTH

Targeting p53 in cancer
Its ‘‘tumor-suppressive TF’’ nature makes p53 seemingly un-
druggable. Nevertheless, a multitude of methods have been
developed to enhance or recover the WT function of p53 de-
pending on its status in cancer cells (whether repressed,
mutated, or lost) (Figure 5). For more information, readers are
referred to recent reviews.74,237

In cancer cells retaining WT p53, an intuitive idea is to abrogate
p53’s inhibition. This can be achieved by reducing the protein
level (using siRNA, proteolysis-targeting chimera [PROTAC], or
molecular glue) or activity of negative regulators of p53. How-
ever, these methods often lack speciﬁcity, as many p53 inhibi-
tory factors have additional targets.238 Hence, lots of efforts
have been made to identify molecules that speciﬁcally disrupt
the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between p53 and its nega-
tive regulators. MDM2 is the major target for elevating WT p53’s
protein level and activity. Nutlin, the ﬁrst small molecule to inter-
fere with MDM2’s binding and degradation of p53 was proposed
in 2004.239 Based on it, several derivatives including RG7112
and a more potent RG7388 (idasanutlin) have been developed
and tested in clinical trials.74,237,240 However, in the phase 3
MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin in relapsed or refractory acute
myeloid leukemia for overall survival (MIRROS) trial, although
an encouraging overall response rate was observed in cytara-
bine plus idasanutlin group over cytarabine plus placebo group,
the primary endpoint (overall survival) was not reached.241 What
is more, idasanutlin treatment may cause hematological and
gastrointestinal toxicities, highlighting the potential side effects
of p53-activating drugs.240 Other small molecular inhibitors of
the MDM2-p53 interaction include APG-115242 and AMG 232
(KRT-232),243 both undergoing clinical trials. ALRN-6924, a

Figure 5. Targeting p53 in cancer
Various methods have been developed to target p53 for cancer treatment. In tumors retaining WT p53, RG7388, APG-115, KRT-232, and ALRN-6924 are used to
disrupt the PPIs between p53 and MDM2 or MDMX, while RITA, tenovin-6, ML364, and UNC0379 target other negative regulators of p53. Activation of p53 can be
utilized in cyclotherapy to protect normal cells, or in combination with other treatments for synergistic tumor eradication. WT p53 can be misfolded into a pseudo-
mutant conformation, which may be reversed with appropriate drugs. Downstream targets of p53 are also potential therapeutic targets to partially reactivate the
p53 signaling pathway. In tumors containing p53 missense mutations, APR-246, COTI-2, ATO, and PAT are capable of restoring the WT conformation of many
p53 mutants. Speciﬁc agents such as PhiKan083, PK7088, PC14586, KG13, and MS78 target the p53 Y220C mutation, while ZMC1 is used for the p53 R175H
mutant. Additionally, genome editing may be useful in correcting p53 gene mutations. NSC59984, ganetespib, MCB-613, and nanoreceptors are able to degrade
mutant p53. ONYX-015, an oncolytic virus, speciﬁcally kills tumor cells with p53 mutations. Agents like ReACp53 and ADH-6 resolve the aggregation of mutant
p53, partially restoring WT p53 functions. Antibodies like P1C1TM and H2-scDb, which recognize neoantigens derived from mutant p53, mediate tumor cell
elimination by immune cells. p53MVA and p53-SLP are p53 vaccines used in immunotherapy. Mutant p53 neoantigens are also useful for developing adoptive cell
therapies. Mutant p53 DNA fragments and proteins (including their aggregates) can be utilized for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. In tumors with p53 nonsense
mutations, G418, 2,6-DAP, CC-90009, and NMDI14 can induce the readthrough of p53 mutant mRNAs, or inhibiting NMD. In p53-null tumors, delivery of p53
protein, mRNA, and DNA may restore p53 expression and eliminate tumor cells. WT, wild-type; Mut, mutant; LOF, loss-of-function; DNE, dominant-negative

stapled a-helical peptide, simultaneously relieves the inhibition
of MDM2 and MDMX on p53.244 Other negative regulators of
p53, such as USP7,245 HPV E6,246 SIRT1/2,247 VPRBP,248 and
SETD8,249 are promising targets for p53 activation. Given that
PTMs are crucial for regulating p53 activity, targeting these co-
factors holds attractive potential. Again, how to speciﬁcally
affect the PTM status of p53 is a big challenge. Cofactors adjust-
ing WT p53’s protein folding, cellular localization, DNA recruit-
ment, and activity dynamics should be considered for targeting
as well. Other aspects related to p53 expression and activity,
including alternative splicing and translation, mRNA stability,
and SNPs, can be targeted too.

In cancer cells with p53 missense mutations, primary efforts
are focused on restoring WT p53 activity. The existence of
pseudo-mutant p53,74 second-site reversion of mutant p53,250
and temperature-sensitive mutant p53251 imply that the confor-
mations of WT and mutant p53 might be interchangeable. This

possibility opens the door to restoring the tumor-suppressive
conformation of mutant p53 by using specially designed small
molecules (correctors). CP-31398, discovered in 1999, was the
ﬁrst compound found to enable mutant p53 to activate transcrip-
tion and suppress tumor growth.252 After that, many more cor-
rectors are identiﬁed, for instance PRIMA-1.253 The degradation
metabolite of PRIMA-1, methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), cova-
lently binds to the thiol group of cysteine in mutant p53, restoring
the WT conformation. Nevertheless, it also alters the redox state
of the cell independently of p53 by reacting with other proteins.
Its derivatives PRIMA-1MET (APR-246, or eprenetapopt) and
APR-548 are undergoing multiple clinical trials.237 A thiosemicar-
bazone drug COTI-2, is also in a clinical trial.254 Arsenic trioxide
(ATO), a drug to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been
found to rescue many p53 mutants, with varying efﬁciencies de-
pending on the solvent accessibility and temperature sensitivity
of the mutants.255,256 The antiparasitic drug potassium antimony

tartrate (PAT) also rescues temperature-sensitive p53 mutants,
like p53-V272M.257 These aforementioned correctors are
responsible for rescuing multiple p53 mutants, but their broad-
spectrum nature may limit efﬁciency for speciﬁc mutations.
Targeted correctors for particular mutations would be more suit-
able for personalized treatment. For example, PhiKan083,258
PK7088,259 PC14586,260 and KG13261 are designed to correct
the p53-Y220C mutant, because of its special conformation.
Additionally, MS78, an acetylation targeting chimera (AceTAC),
promotes the K382 acetylation of p53-Y220C, thereby specially
rescuing its tumor suppressive activity.262 For a more common
the thiosemicarbazone drug ZMC1
p53-R175H mutant,
(NSC319726) is discovered, facilitating zinc binding and forcing
the mutant into a WT conformation.263 The aggregation of
mutant p53 can be relieved by ReACp53264 and ADH-6.265 The
dissociated mutant p53 partly recovers tumor-suppressive ac-
tivity. Some GOF aspects of mutant p53 are targetable too.
NSC59984, for example, promotes mutant p53 degradation,266
releasing sequestered p73 to inhibit tumor growth. Other drugs,
such as ganetespib,267 MCB-613,268 and biomimetic nanore-
ceptor,269 also promote mutant p53 degradation.

To treat nonsense mutations of p53, chemicals inducing trans-
lational readthrough or inhibiting nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD), such as G418, 2,6-DAP, CC-90009, and NMDI14
can be utilized.74,237 For p53-mutated cancer cells, an alterna-
tive approach is oncolytic virus therapy. ONYX-015, a modiﬁed
adenovirus, replicates only in p53-inactivated cells, thus selec-
tively targeting cancer cells with p53 mutations while sparing
normal cells.270

To treat p53-null tumors, one approach is to introduce p53 pro-
tein or use gene therapy to deliver p53 mRNA or DNA into tumor
cells, thereby reinstating the expression of WT p53 protein.271–273
Advances in adeno-associated virus (AAV) and nanoparticle tech-
niques may enhance the development and application of p53 gene
therapy. The potential of CRISPR-Cas9 base editing technology
for correcting p53 mutations in tumors is intriguing.

Targeting p53 can involve diverse cell types in the TME to
achieve a tumor-suppressive outcome. For example, p53 activa-
tion induces the expression of endogenous retroviruses, which
can potentiate immunotherapy.274 As previously introduced,
mutant p53 can generate neoantigens targetable by immuno-
therapy.153–155 The engineered antibody P1C1TM, for instance,
can distinguish between different p53-derived peptide-MHCs
on WT and p53 mutant cells, mediating cytotoxicity or serving
as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to speciﬁcally eliminate
p53 mutated tumor cells.154 The bispeciﬁc antibody H2-scDb,
which bridges cancer cells presenting a p53-R175H neoantigen
with T cells, effectively facilitates the destruction of cancer cells
by T cells.153 Identifying mutant p53-derived neoantigens can
also enhance adoptive cell therapies (such as CAR-T and
TCR-T)155 and the development of p53 vaccines.275,276 The suc-
cess of mRNA vaccine technology encourages further explora-
tion in the p53 vaccine direction. Targeting p53 in immune cells
and tumor stroma cells (e.g., cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts)
could enhance anti-tumor effects as well.147,277,278

exploit synthetic lethal effects created by simultaneously acti-
vating p53 and intervening in other pathways.282–284 For
in acute myeloid leukemia, the activation of p53
instance,
coupled with Bcl-2 inhibition helps overcome resistance to indi-
vidual treatments and stimulates apoptosis in cancer cells.282

Beyond directly targeting the p53 protein, key downstream com-
ponents, especially those effectors critical for p53-mediated tumor
suppression, can also be targeted to partially reactivate the p53
signaling pathway. This approach, while potentially less effective
than activating WT p53, may be more feasible and serve as a com-
plement to p53-targeting strategies.122,225,285 Besides the thera-
peutic and prophylactic applications, the diagnostic and prog-
nostic values of p53 should not be overlooked either.198,208–212,286
Although there never lacks ideas to target p53, only a minority
of them can enter clinical trial, not to mention the successful
approval into clinical application. There are several obstacles
to overcome before a p53-targeted drug can truly beneﬁt the
cancer patients. Firstly, the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (ADME) of the drug need to be optimized. Sec-
ondly, the efﬁciency of the p53-targeted therapy is inﬂuenced
by various factors. Although p53 has potent tumor-suppressive
capabilities, its activation does not always guarantee efﬁcient tu-
mor cell eradication.287,288 Strategies such as patient stratiﬁca-
tion and combination treatments may enhance efﬁcacy. Thirdly,
the low speciﬁcity of some drugs may result in off-target effects.
Fourthly, the side effects caused by the on-target or off-target
drug toxicity are among the major safety concerns. This is partic-
ularly evident in normal cells when activating WT p53 by blocking
MDM2-p53 interaction. Given that the induction of cell-cycle ar-
rest, apoptosis, and senescence is dispensable in p53-triggered
tumor suppression,289 developing methods to retain p53’s anti-
tumor effect without harming normal cells is a realistic goal.
Another concern arises from the possibility that in normal cells
harboring p53 mutations, MDM2 inhibitors could potentially acti-
vate the oncogenic function of these p53 mutants by stabilizing
them. This consideration warrants serious attention in clinical
practice. Speciﬁc drug delivery to tumor cells could reduce
toxicity.
that
p53-mediated cell death contributes signiﬁcantly to the side ef-
fects experienced during tumor
radiotherapy and chemo-
therapy.187,188 Consequently, suppressing p53 activity might
be beneﬁcial in reducing these treatment-related side effects.290
Interestingly, if controlled well, the mild activation of p53 could
be employed in cyclotherapy, serving to protect normal cells.291
Fifthly, p53-targeted therapy poses the risk of driving tumor evo-
lution, and selection of new mutations of p53 or alterations in the
p53 pathway,
resistance and tumor
relapse.74,292,293 Appropriate combination treatments may help
to mitigate this risk. Sixthly, p53 rarely promotes tumor survival,
progression, drug resistance, and relapse, as mentioned before.
In such scenarios, careful consideration is necessary to deter-
mine whether activating p53 is advisable. With progress in ﬁelds
like artiﬁcial intelligence,294 structural biology, and multi-omics,
these problems will be eventually addressed.

It’s worth noting, as previously discussed,

leading to treatment

The status of p53 can signiﬁcantly impact the sensitivity to
certain cancer treatments.279,280 Often, p53-targeted therapies
are combined with other treatments for two primary purposes:
to enhance the efﬁcacy of activating or restoring p53,281 and to

Targeting p53 in other physiological and pathological
settings

cancers. However, given p53’s broad impact, strategically
modulating its activity could potentially enhance health by
improving normal physiological functions and alleviating p53-
associated disorders. For example, activating p53 in the uterus
might increase the success rate of embryo implantation, while in-
hibiting p53 might prevent NDDs and reduce ischemic organ
injury. In the context of metabolic disorders and aging, the role
of p53 remains debatable and warrants further investigation.
To suppress p53 activity, various methods can be employed,
such as using p53 inhibitors,186,290 disrupting the PPIs between
p53 and its activators,295 or augmenting the function of negative
regulators of p53. These approaches essentially mirror those
used for activating p53 but in reverse. A word of caution is that
suppressing p53 might inadvertently increase the risk of tumor-
igenesis. Strategies like short-term intervention and cell type-
speciﬁc delivery of p53-inhibitory drugs could decrease this
risk. Looking ahead, it is full of hope that targeting p53 can
improve health outcomes beyond just cancer treatment.

INTRIGUING QUESTIONS IN THE P53 FIELD: OPEN
QUESTIONS, BRIGHT FUTURE

Great progress has been made over the past 45 years in p53
research. Basic regulations, functions, and therapeutic poten-
tials of p53 have been elucidated. Nevertheless, there are still
some fundamental questions awaiting to answer.

Firstly, what is the function of basal p53? In resting cell, both
the expression and activity of p53 protein are kept low, until
various stimuli stabilize and activate it. However, obvious stress
is not always required for p53 to carry out some of its functions,
such as regulating stem cell dynamics, cell competition, ROS
level, and immune activity.105,142,296 So how does basal p53
work in unstressed cells? Does the basal activity of p53
contribute to tumor suppression? Basal p53 can bind to the pro-
moters or enhancers of its target genes, establishing a primed
state for rapid responses to stresses.23 Importantly, it also main-
tains a speciﬁc expression proﬁle of target genes.297 Particularly,
basal p53 is responsible for the baseline level of some tumor
suppressor genes, like PTEN.298 There may be differences in
the target gene lists between basal and activated p53. Evidence
also suggests that robust stabilization,44 full transactivation abil-
ity,297 and tetrameric conformation205 of p53 are not absolutely
necessary for its tumor suppression effect. Therefore, leveraging
the basal activity of p53 may help minimize side effects on
normal cells and reduce the risk of selecting p53 mutations re-
sulting from its activation. Studying the function of basal p53 re-
quires an appropriate model. While knocking out p53 in a tumor
cell line might provide some insights, transferring cells to tissue
culture can be a p53-inducing stress. p53 levels in cultured cells
may not reﬂect a truly unstressed basal state, which presents a
caveat when interpreting in vitro results. More importantly,
cultured cells lack the diverse environmental cues present in vivo
and thus cannot fully simulate the actual tumorigenic process.
Moreover, the phenotype observed in p53 KO mice should not
be solely attributed to the loss of basal p53 activity, as the func-
tions of stress-activated p53 are eliminated, too.

Secondly, what is the contribution of p53’s repressive target
genes to its function? p53’s role is not limited to activating tran-
scription. It has also been found to repress the expression of

ll

many genes,299 with the notable examples such as SLC7A11,107
NANOG,117 and VKORC1L1.109 In most cases, p53 suppresses
gene expression indirectly, either through transcriptional or post-
transcriptional mechanisms. It competes with other TFs for DNA
binding,120,300 activates negative regulators of gene expres-
sion,301–304 and suppresses the expression of transcription activa-
tors.305 Otherwise, direct repression of transcription by p53,
through binding to special REs,117,119,306,307 interfering with
enhancer function,118,305 and remolding chromatin structure305
are reported as well. Although the direct transcriptional repression
by p53 is a subject of ongoing debate308 and requires further inves-
tigation, it is clear that hundreds of genes are downregulated upon
p53 activation or upregulated in its absence. Future studies are ex-
pected to shed more light on whether and how p53 functions as a
direct transcription repressor, and the roles these repressive target
genes play within the p53 network.

Thirdly, are genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
sufﬁciently effective for p53 research? While GEMMs have
signiﬁcantly advanced our understanding of p53,289,309 they
also present inherent limitations. The most notable is the species
gap between humans and mice, as many human p53 targets are
not shared by mouse p53,310 not to mention the differences in
immune system or other biological systems. The knowledge
about p53 got from in vitro studies is often tested in mouse
models. Nonetheless, most reproducible results in mice could
not be directly translated to applications in humans. Currently,
humanized mouse models311,312 and human organoids313 serve
as useful supplements to GEMMs. However, these alternatives
have their limitations as well. Consequently, there is a pressing
need to develop more practical and human physiopathologically
relevant systems for p53 research.

Fourthly, what are the underpinning mechanisms and biological
relevance of the context-dependent activity of p53? A reiterated
feature of p53 activity in the aforementioned sections is its
context-dependency. The target proﬁle of p53 exhibits signiﬁcant
organ speciﬁcity and spatiotemporal variations.314 Heterogeneity
in p53 expression is also evident within a single tumor.315 Even
within the same cell, the target selectivity and functional outcome
of p53 activation are determined by a variety of variables.23 In addi-
tion, gender can dictate p53-regulated human behavior.316 When
interpreting experimental results related to p53, placing them
within a speciﬁc context is essential.104 Further effort is still war-
ranted for a deeper understanding of p53 activity and the develop-
ment of context-speciﬁc treatment regimens that target p53.

Fifthly, is targeting p53 truly a practical approach for treating can-
cers? The differential alterations of p53 in cancers and the exten-
sive variety of p53 missense mutations complicate the design of
speciﬁc drugs for each type of p53 alteration. The context-depen-
dency of p53 activity adds another layer of complexity to this issue.
However, targeting p53 as a treatment for cancers remains an
enticing approach to pursue. Considering the frequent side effects,
are there other elements in the p53 pathway that could serve as
safer targets than MDM2, without compromising anti-tumor efﬁ-
cacy? Is it possible to achieve a ‘‘two-drugs-cure-all’’ goal by acti-
vating or inhibiting p53 to treat all p53-associated diseases, and
improve overall health, particularly in extending longevity? This
ambition may seem lofty, but it is certainly worth exploring.

Likewise, several other important questions remain unan-
swered. New targets of p53 are continuously being identiﬁed. A

notable example is zinc ﬁnger matrin-type 3 (ZMAT3), which plays
a critical role in p53-dependent tumor suppression.317–320 What
are the unidentiﬁed targets and functions of p53? What targets
or functions are indispensable for p53 to mediate tumor suppres-
sion? What is the functional diversity and evolutionary signiﬁcance
of p53’s two TADs? How do they cooperate in executing p53’s tu-
mor-suppressive function? Some progress has been made in this
area,19,297 but it has not been fully addressed. Are the non-cell-
autonomous activities of p53 viable targets for cancer treatment?
Under what circumstances does p53 shift to support tumor devel-
opment? Can we leverage p63 and p73 to synergize with p53 tar-
geting in the treatment of cancers or other diseases? The list of the
questions could be longer. New questions will emerge in the
future. It is on the way to ﬁnd answers to these questions, our un-
derstanding of p53 is refreshed and deepened.

CONCLUSIONS

The past 45 years of p53 research represent a remarkable journey.
As discussed previously, countless discoveries result in a much
better understanding of the complexity of p53 functions under
different physiological settings. The diverse tumor suppression
mechanisms including both classical activities and a growing
number of other p53 functions raise a more interesting issue about
which pathway is more critical for suppressing tumor growth in
different types of human cancers. Moreover, although p53 is
well accepted as a tumor suppressor, not all p53-induced activ-
ities are necessary for tumor suppression. For example, p53-
mediated pro-survival activity seems at odds with its growth-sup-
pressive function in tumors; however, this activity is potentially
important for normal cell homeostasis, allowing normal cell sur-
vival during stress responses. The challenge remains how to acti-
vate p53 function for cancer therapy. The difﬁculties associated
with translating the MDM2-targeting approach into clinical appli-
cation raises a serious issue about how to kill cancer cells without
harming normal tissues. It remains unclear whether the toxicity
induced by MDM2 inhibitors (particularly in the bone marrow) is
unique for the MDM2 pathway or for p53 activation in general. If
the former is the case, targeting different pathways for p53 activa-
tion should be seriously considered.248 Notably, in contrast to the
classic activities such as apoptosis, many p53 targets involved in
metabolism, ferroptosis, and immunity do not directly cause se-
vere harm to cell viability.321 It will be interesting to examine
whether the speciﬁc activation of those pathways effectively sup-
presses tumor growth without causing severe toxicity.
