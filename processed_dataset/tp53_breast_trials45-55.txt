Breast cancer metastasis remains a clinical challenge, even within a single 
patient across multiple sites of the disease. Genome-wide comparisons of both 
the DNA and gene expression of primary tumors and metastases in multiple 
patients could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms that cause breast cancer 
metastasis. To address this issue, we performed DNA exome and RNA sequencing of 
matched primary tumors and multiple metastases from 16 patients, totaling 83 
distinct specimens. We identified tumor-specific drivers by integrating known 
protein-protein network information with RNA expression and somatic DNA 
alterations and found that genetic drivers were predominantly established in the 
primary tumor and maintained through metastatic spreading. In addition, our 
analyses revealed that most genetic drivers were DNA copy number changes, the 
TP53 mutation was a recurrent founding mutation regardless of subtype, and that 
multiclonal seeding of metastases was frequent and occurred in multiple 
subtypes. Genetic drivers unique to metastasis were identified as somatic 
mutations in the estrogen and androgen receptor genes. These results highlight 
the complexity of metastatic spreading, be it monoclonal or multiclonal, and 
suggest that most metastatic drivers are established in the primary tumor, 
despite the substantial heterogeneity seen in the metastases.

Purpose We report the first-in-human phase Ia study to our knowledge ( 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01219699) identifying the maximum tolerated 
dose and assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of single-agent alpelisib 
(BYL719), an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα)-selective inhibitor. 
Patients and Methods In the dose-escalation phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered 
advanced solid tumors received once-daily or twice-daily oral alpelisib on a 
continuous schedule. In the dose-expansion phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered 
solid tumors and PIK3CA-wild-type, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer received alpelisib 400 mg once 
daily. Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment. Alpelisib 
maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice 
daily. Nine patients (13.2%) in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting 
toxicities of hyperglycemia (n = 6), nausea (n = 2), and both hyperglycemia and 
hypophosphatemia (n = 1). Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events 
included hyperglycemia (51.5%), nausea (50.0%), decreased appetite (41.8%), 
diarrhea (40.3%), and vomiting (31.3%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; 
half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. 
Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily; overall 
response rate was 6.0% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a 
complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, 
and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 
(52.2%) patients and was maintained > 24 weeks in 13 (9.7%) patients; disease 
control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2%. In 
patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-negative breast cancer, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. 
Frequently mutated genes (≥ 10% tumors) included TP53 (51.3%), APC (23.7%), KRAS 
(22.4%), ARID1A (13.2%), and FBXW7 (10.5%). Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a 
tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with 
PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, supporting the rationale for selective PI3Kα 
inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant 
tumors.

Purpose Endoxifen is a tamoxifen metabolite with potent antiestrogenic activity. 
Patients and Methods We performed a phase I study of oral Z-endoxifen to 
determine its toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and 
clinical activity. Eligibility included endocrine-refractory, estrogen 
receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. An accelerated titration schedule 
was applied until moderate or dose-limiting toxicity occurred, followed by a 3+3 
design and expansion at 40, 80, and 100 mg per day. Tumor DNA from serum 
(circulating cell free [cf); all patients] and biopsies [160 mg/day and 
expansion]) was sequenced. Results Of 41 enrolled patients, 38 were evaluable 
for MTD determination. Prior endocrine regimens during which progression 
occurred included aromatase inhibitor (n = 36), fulvestrant (n = 21), and 
tamoxifen (n = 15). Patients received endoxifen once daily at seven dose levels 
(20 to 160 mg). Dose escalation ceased at 160 mg per day given lack of MTD and 
endoxifen concentrations > 1,900 ng/mL. Endoxifen clearance was unaffected by 
CYP2D6 genotype. One patient (60 mg) had cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity 
(pulmonary embolus). Overall clinical benefit rate (stable > 6 months [n = 7] or 
partial response by RECIST criteria [n = 3]) was 26.3% (95% CI, 13.4% to 43.1%) 
including prior tamoxifen progression (n = 3). cfDNA mutations were observed in 
13 patients ( PIK3CA [n = 8], ESR1 [n = 5], TP53 [n = 4], and AKT [n = 1]) with 
shorter progression-free survival ( v those without cfDNA mutations; median, 61 
v 132 days; log-rank P = .046). Clinical benefit was observed in those with ESR1 
amplification (tumor; 80 mg/day) and ESR1 mutation (cfDNA; 160 mg/day). 
Comparing tumor biopsies and cfDNA, some mutations ( PIK3CA, TP53, and AKT) were 
undetected by cfDNA, whereas cfDNA mutations ( ESR1, TP53, and AKT) were 
undetected by biopsy. Conclusion In endocrine-refractory metastatic breast 
cancer, Z-endoxifen provides substantial drug exposure unaffected by CYP2D6 
metabolism, acceptable toxicity, and promising antitumor activity.

BACKGROUND: The retinoblastoma (RB) gene is a tumor-suppressor gene that plays a 
central role in regulating the cell cycle. Inactivation of this gene is involved 
in breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 827 patients with breast cancer treated with 
taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy were included in the study. Protein 
expression of RB, phosphorylated RB (pRB), p16, cyclin D1 and p53 was evaluated 
by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Neither of the retinoblastoma markers (RB and pRB) reached statistical 
significance in terms of their association with disease-free or overall 
survival. Nevertheless, when clustering analysis was performed, patients with 
tumors featuring low levels of p16, cyclin D1 and p53 with concomitantly high 
levels of pRB had reduced risk for relapse (Wald's p=0.015).
CONCLUSION: The p53-mediated sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 
chemotherapeutic agents appears to be driven mostly by pRB. Using agents that 
enhance RB phosphorylation might possibly increase the chemosensitivity of 
breast cancer cells.

Purpose This phase I study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
antitumor activity, and predictive biomarkers of pyrotinib, an irreversible 
pan-ErbB inhibitor, in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients and Methods Pyrotinib was 
administered continuously, orally, once per day to patients who did not have 
prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2. Planned dose escalation 
was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed 
blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was 
performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results 
Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 
diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, 
the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events 
included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral 
ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia 
(10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. 
The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate 
(complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 
of 36). The median progression-free survival was 35.4 weeks (95% CI, 23.3 to 
40.0 weeks). The overall response rate was 83.3% (10 of 12) in trastuzumab-naive 
patients and 33.3% (eight of 24) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Preliminary 
results suggest that PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in circulating tumor DNA ( P = 
.013) rather than in archival tumor tissues ( P = .474) may predict the efficacy 
of pyrotinib. Conclusion Continuous once-per-day pyrotinib was well tolerated 
and demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive patients with 
metastatic breast cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was established as 400 mg. 
Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxicity. The promising antitumor activity and 
acceptable tolerability of pyrotinib warrant its further evaluation in a phase 
II study.

Previous precision medicine studies have investigated conventional molecular 
techniques and/or limited sets of gene alterations. The aim of this study was to 
describe the impact of the next-generation sequencing of the largest panel of 
genes used to date in tumour tissue and blood in the context of institutional 
molecular screening programmes. DNA analysis was performed by next-generation 
sequencing using a panel of 426 cancer-related genes and by comparative genomic 
hybridization from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archived tumour samples 
when available or from fresh tumour samples. Five hundred sixty-eight patients 
were enrolled. The median number of prior lines of treatment was 2 (range 0-9). 
The most common primary tumour types were lung (16.9%), colorectal (14.4%), 
breast (10.6%), ovarian (10.2%) and sarcoma (10.2%). The median patient age was 
63 years (range 19-88). A total of 292 patients (51.4%) presented with at least 
one actionable genetic alteration. The 20 genes most frequently altered were 
TP53, CDKN2A, KRAS, PTEN, PI3KCA, RB1, APC, ERBB2, MYC, EGFR, CDKN2B, ARID1A, 
SMAD4, FGFR1, MDM2, BRAF, ATM, CCNE1, FGFR3 and FRS2. One hundred fifty-nine 
patients (28%) were included in early phase trials. The treatment was matched 
with a tumour profile in 86 cases (15%). The two main reasons for non-inclusion 
were non-progressive disease (31.5%) and general status deterioration (25%). 
Twenty-eight percent of patients presented with a growth modulation index (time 
to progression under the early phase trial treatment/time to progression of the 
previous line of treatment) >1.3.Extensive molecular profiling using 
high-throughput techniques allows for the identification of actionable mutations 
in the majority of cases and is associated with substantial clinical benefit in 
up to one in four patients.

    Precision Cancer Diagnostics: Tracking Genomic Evolution in Clinical Trials.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive form of 
breast cancer associated with HER2 amplification, with high risk of metastasis 
and an estimated median survival of 2.9 y. We performed an open-label, 
single-arm phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428) to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family 
inhibitor, alone and in combination with vinorelbine in patients with 
HER2-positive IBC. This trial included prospectively planned exome analysis 
before and after afatinib monotherapy.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: HER2-positive IBC patients received afatinib 40 mg daily 
until progression, and thereafter afatinib 40 mg daily and intravenous 
vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 weekly. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit; 
secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), duration of OR, and 
progression-free survival (PFS). Of 26 patients treated with afatinib 
monotherapy, clinical benefit was achieved in 9 patients (35%), 0 of 7 
trastuzumab-treated patients and 9 of 19 trastuzumab-naïve patients. Following 
disease progression, 10 patients received afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 
clinical benefit was achieved in 2 of 4 trastuzumab-treated and 0 of 6 
trastuzumab-naïve patients. All patients had treatment-related adverse events 
(AEs). Whole-exome sequencing of tumour biopsies taken before treatment and 
following disease progression on afatinib monotherapy was performed to assess 
the mutational landscape of IBC and evolutionary trajectories during therapy. 
Compared to a cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with 
HER2-positive non-IBC, HER2-positive IBC patients had significantly higher 
mutational and neoantigenic burden, more frequent gain-of-function TP53 
mutations and a recurrent 11q13.5 amplification overlapping PAK1. Planned 
exploratory analysis revealed that trastuzumab-naïve patients with tumours 
harbouring somatic activation of PI3K/Akt signalling had significantly shorter 
PFS compared to those without (p = 0.03). High genomic concordance between 
biopsies taken before and following afatinib resistance was observed with stable 
clonal structures in non-responding tumours, and evidence of branched evolution 
in 8 of 9 tumours analysed. Recruitment to the trial was terminated early 
following the LUX-Breast 1 trial, which showed that afatinib combined with 
vinorelbine had similar PFS and OR rates to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine but 
shorter overall survival (OS), and was less tolerable. The main limitations of 
this study are that the results should be interpreted with caution given the 
relatively small patient cohort and the potential for tumour sampling bias 
between pre- and post-treatment tumour biopsies.
CONCLUSIONS: Afatinib, with or without vinorelbine, showed activity in 
trastuzumab-naïve HER2-positive IBC patients in a planned subgroup analysis. 
HER2-positive IBC is characterized by frequent TP53 gain-of-function mutations 
and a high mutational burden. The high mutational load associated with 
HER2-positive IBC suggests a potential role for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in 
this disease.

Pre-surgical studies allow study of the relationship between mutations and 
response of oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer to aromatase 
inhibitors (AIs) but have been limited to small biopsies. Here in phase I of 
this study, we perform exome sequencing on baseline, surgical core-cuts and 
blood from 60 patients (40 AI treated, 20 controls). In poor responders (based 
on Ki67 change), we find significantly more somatic mutations than good 
responders. Subclones exclusive to baseline or surgical cores occur in ∼30% of 
tumours. In phase II, we combine targeted sequencing on another 28 treated 
patients with phase I. We find six genes frequently mutated: PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, 
MLL3, ABCA13 and FLG with 71% concordance between paired cores. TP53 mutations 
are associated with poor response. We conclude that multiple biopsies are 
essential for confident mutational profiling of ER+ breast cancer and TP53 
mutations are associated with resistance to oestrogen deprivation therapy.

Purpose: Chk1 inhibition potentiates DNA-damaging chemotherapy by overriding 
cell-cycle arrest and genome repair. This phase I study evaluated the Chk1 
inhibitor GDC-0425 given in combination with gemcitabine to patients with 
advanced solid tumors.Experimental Design: Patients received GDC-0425 alone for 
a 1-week lead-in followed by 21-day cycles of gemcitabine plus GDC-0425. 
Gemcitabine was initially administered at 750 mg/m2 (Arm A), then increased to 
1,000 mg/m2 (Arm B), on days 1 and 8 in a 3 + 3 + 3 dose escalation to establish 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). GDC-0425 was initially administered daily for 
three consecutive days; however, dosing was abbreviated to a single day on the 
basis of pharmacokinetics and tolerability. TP53 mutations were evaluated in 
archival tumor tissue. On-treatment tumor biopsies underwent pharmacodynamic 
biomarker analyses.Results: Forty patients were treated with GDC-0425. The MTD 
of GDC-0425 was 60 mg when administered approximately 24 hours after gemcitabine 
1,000 mg/m2 Dose-limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia (n = 5), 
neutropenia (n = 4), dyspnea, nausea, pyrexia, syncope, and increased alanine 
aminotransferase (n = 1 each). Common related adverse events were nausea (48%); 
anemia, neutropenia, vomiting (45% each); fatigue (43%); pyrexia (40%); and 
thrombocytopenia (35%). The GDC-0425 half-life was approximately 15 hours. There 
were two confirmed partial responses in patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer (TP53-mutated) and melanoma (n = 1 each) and one unconfirmed partial 
response in a patient with cancer of unknown primary origin.Conclusions: Chk1 
inhibition with GDC-0425 in combination with gemcitabine was tolerated with 
manageable bone marrow suppression. The observed preliminary clinical activity 
warrants further investigation of this chemopotentiation strategy. Clin Cancer 
Res; 23(10); 2423-32. ©2016 AACR.

BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer 
predisposition syndrome characterized by a very high lifetime cancer risk and an 
early age at diagnosis of a wide cancer spectrum. Precise estimates for the risk 
of first and subsequent cancers are lacking.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Study includes 
families meeting the diagnostic criteria for LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, 
and individuals with a germline TP53 mutation, choroid plexus carcinoma, 
adrenocortical carcinoma, or ≥3 cancers. Herein, we estimated the cumulative 
risk and annual hazards for first and second cancers among TP53 mutation 
carriers (TP53 positive [TP53+]) using MATLAB statistical software.
RESULTS: This study evaluated 286 TP53+ individuals from 107 families. The 
cumulative cancer incidence was 50% by age 31 years among TP53+ females and 46 
years among males, and nearly 100% by age 70 years for both sexes. Cancer risk 
was highest after age 20 years for females, mostly due to breast cancer, whereas 
among males the risk was higher in childhood and later adulthood. Among females, 
the cumulative incidence rates by age 70 years for breast cancer, soft tissue 
sarcoma, brain cancer, and osteosarcoma were 54%, 15%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. 
Among males, the incidence rates were 22%, 19%, and 11%, respectively, for soft 
tissue sarcoma, brain cancer, and osteosarcoma. Approximately 49% of those with 
1 cancer developed at least another cancer after a median of 10 years. The 
average age-specific risk of developing a second cancer was comparable to that 
of developing a first cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative cancer risk in TP53 + individuals was very high and 
varied by sex, age, and cancer type. Additional work, including prospective risk 
estimates, is needed to better inform personalized risk management. Cancer

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype with poor 
prognosis, and treatment options are limited to chemotherapy. Because the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in up to 70% of these 
tumors, this phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin as first- or 
second-line treatment for metastatic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult women with metastatic TNBC with a maximum of 1 
previous chemotherapy regimen were eligible. Patients received gemcitabine 
intravenous (I.V.) 1500 mg/m2, carboplatin area under the concentration-time 
curve = 2.5 I.V., and panitumumab 6 mg/kg I.V. every 2 weeks. Treatment 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with disease 
evaluations every 6 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival 
(PFS). Archival tissue was collected for correlative analysis, to include 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, p53, 
phosphatase and tensin homolog, EGFR, and status.
RESULTS: Between May 2010 and August 2012, 71 women (median age, 54 years; 14% 
de novo stage IV) were treated. At a median follow-up of 11 months, the median 
PFS was 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 3.2-5.5 months). The objective 
response rate was 42% (complete response, 1; partial response, 29). 
Treatment-related toxicity included: rash, 50 patients (70%), fatigue, 37 
patients (52%), neutropenia, 32 patients (45%; 2 episodes of febrile 
neutropenia), and thrombocytopenia, 32 patients (45%).
CONCLUSION: Although the addition of panitumumab was feasible, the results of 
this trial do not support combination of panitumumab with gemcitabine and 
carboplatin in the treatment of patients with TNBC.
