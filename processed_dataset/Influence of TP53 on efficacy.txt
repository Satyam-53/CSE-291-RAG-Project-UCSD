Abstract
TP53 comutation is related to poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer. How-

ever, there is limited study focusing on the structural influence of TP53 mutation
on third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs) treatment. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and molecular

data of patients treated with third-generation EGFR-TKIs in two independent
cohorts. A total of 117 patients from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center

(SYSUCC) and 141 patients from the American Association for Cancer Research
Project GENIE database were included. In the SYSUCC cohort, TP53 comuta-

tions were found in 59 patients (50.4%) and were associated with poor median
progress-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS). The additional

subtype analysis found that TP53 mutation in the alpha-helix region had shorter
mOS compared with those with TP53 mutations in other regions in the SYSUCC
cohort (mOS, 12.2 vs. 21.7 months; p = 0.027). Similar findings were confirmed in

region was an independent negative predictive factor for PFS [hazard ratio (HR)

outcomes in patients treated with third-generation EGFR-TKIs.

INTRODUCTION

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first-line therapy
in advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).1,2 Despite high tumor response rates with first-
line EGFR-TKIs, approximately 60% of patients encounter
secondary EGFR T790M mutations at the time of acquired
resistance.3 Several
third-generation EGFR-TKIs were
designed to selectively and irreversibly target both the orig-
inal EGFR-sensitive mutations and the sequential EGFR
T790M mutation, such as osimertinib (AZD9291),4 aumol-
ertinib (almonertinib; HS-10296),5 avitinib (abivertinib;
AC0010),6 and so on, which have become the front-
line and second-line therapy for advanced EGFR-mutant
NSCLC. Unfortunately, similar to the situation with first-
generation EGFR-TKIs, not all the patients reach the
average progress-free survival (PFS) and emerge from
a phenomenon of primary drug resistance.7 With the
widespread use of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, elucida-
tion of the molecular mechanisms behind drug resistance
and strategies for alleviating it are paramount.

With the development of next-generation sequenc-
ing (NGS), comprehensive genomic analysis could help
improve patient outcomes.2 TP53 is the most common
comutation gene in NSCLC, with frequency ranging from
34.4 to 53.7%.8,9 Recently, the TP53 mutation status has
been evaluated as a predictor of the clinical outcome
of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients undergoing treatment
with EGFR-TKIs.10–14 Some studies have found an asso-
ciation between TP53 and poorer PFS or overall survival
(OS) in the treatment of first-generation EGFR-TKIs.10–14
Currently, there are also similar findings in some studies

on the treatment of third-generation EGFR-TKI.15–17 With
the development and wide application of third-generation
TKIs, further data are required to figure out the role of TP53
in the treatment of third-generation TKIs.

It has been reported that structural TP53 mutations
(mut) affect the p53 protein function.18,19 However, it
is still unclear whether different structural TP53 muta-
tions represent a clinically homogeneous group. Different
hotspot TP53 mutants that influence the structure of
p53 protein may exert distinct effects on cancer treat-
ment outcomes.16,20–22 TP53 exon 8 mutation was reported
to be related to shorter OS in first-generation EGFR-
TKIs.16,20 However, limited data are available on the effect
of TP53 exon 8 in third-generation EGFR-TKIs treatment.
According to the disturbance of protein structure, TP53
comutation was divided into disruptive and nondisrup-
tive mutations.21 Disruptive mutations may lead to loss
of function with p53 protein activity, while nondisrup-
tive mutations still retain some of the tumor suppressive
functions of p53 protein.21 Some studies reported that
nondisruptive mutations in TP53 can classify the response
of NSCLC receiving first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment11,23;
nevertheless, Molina-Vila et al.8 found the nondisrup-
tive TP53 mutation cannot well predict the prognosis
of patients receiving erlotinib. Different classifications of
TP53 mutations may have different impacts on prognosis,
which warrants further investigation.

Most of the previous studies have primarily focused on
examining the variations within the exon regions of TP53
mutation (exon 5−8).16,20 Some research has also explored
the disruptive/nondisruptive aspects.8,11,23 However, there
has been a lack of research specifically dedicated to inves-
tigating the distribution of secondary structures of the p53

protein. The basic types of protein secondary structure
include alpha helix (α-helix), beta-strand (β-strand), loop,
turn, and others.15,24,25 Alpha-helix is an important protein
secondary structural unit and the formation and stability
of the α-helix are affected by the shape, size, and charge
of the side chain groups of the amino acid residues in
the peptide chain.24 Alpha-helix is vital for the structure
and function of the p53 protein, and structurally chang-
ing the α-helix region might also have some effect on the
treatment. The effect of α-helix alterations due to TP53
mutations on efficacy remains unclear.

This study aimed to confirm the role of the TP53
mutation in advanced NSCLC patients treated with third-
generation EGFR-TKIs as first-line treatment or after the
failure of a previous EGFR-TKIs treatment. Analyses were
conducted to evaluate the status of the TP53 gene and TP53
subtypes in predicting the prognosis.

Clinical characteristics of patients

Among 223 EGFR-mutant patients who had received third-
generation EGFR-TKIs, qualified sequencing data were
acquired from 117 patients (Figure 1). A total of 60 patients
were genotyped by tissue NGS, 41 by plasma-based NGS,
and 16 by pleural effusion NGS. Table 1 details the clin-
icopathological characteristics of the patients in the Sun
Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) cohort. The
majority of patients were female (62.4%), and 84 were never
smokers (71.8%) (Table 1). There were 107 (91.5%) patients
received osimertinib, and 10 (8.5%) received avitinib or

almonertinib. Seventy-five (64.1%) of EGFR exon 19 dele-
tions (19 del) and 39 (33.3%) of EGFR exon 21 L858R point
mutations were detected. A similar proportion of patients
were present in the TP53 mut and wild-type (wt) group
based on age, gender, histology, smoking history, EGFR
mutations, type of third-generation TKIs, treatment lines,
bone metastases, and brain metastases. Patients in the
TP53 mut group had more liver metastases than patients
in the TP53 wt group (22.0% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.039). The
emergence of EGFR T790M mutation was observed in
85 patients; no difference was observed between TP53 wt
(72.4%) and TP53 mut (72.9%) groups.

Of the 59 patients with TP53 mutation detected, the
mutation in TP53 exon 5 (30.5%) was the most com-
mon, followed by exon 8 (20.3%), exon 7 (18.6%), exon 6
(18.6%), and others (Figure 2A). As for the perspective of
the structural subgroup, TP53 mutations were classified
according to the secondary structure of the TP53 protein,
including mutation in the α-helix, β-strand, loop, turn and
other region. The mutation of the TP53 α-helix region
was present in 22.0% of patients, TP53 β-strand region in
28.8% of patients, TP53 loop region in 22.0% of patients,
turn and other regions in 27.1% of patients (Figure 2B
and Table S1). Details of TP53 mutations are shown in
Figure 2C. Other coexisting mutations were present in
55 cases, including EGFR amplification (17.9%, 21 out of
117), MET amplification (8.5%, 10 out of 117), NOTCH
mutation/In frame del (5.1%, six out of 117), and BRAF
amplification/mutation(4.3%, five out of 117), as shown in
Figure 2D.

In the independent cohort from the American Associa-
tion for Cancer Research Project GENIE database, a total
of 141 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received
osimertinib were included in this study (Table S2). There

p = 0.00043) (Figure 3B).

TP53 mutation was related to

2.2
shorter median PFS and mOS of NSCLC
patients treated with third-generation
EGFR-TKIs

In the SYSUCC cohort, 81 patients reached the PFS event;
the median PFS (mPFS) of all patients was 12.2 months
[95% confidence intervals (CI), 11.0–15.3]. Patients with
TP53 comutation had worse mPFS than TP53 wt patients
(mPFS, 9.4 vs. 16.4 months, p = 0.0066) (Figure 3A). A total
of 68 patients reached the OS event; median OS was 24.0
months (95% CI, 18.8–29.3). The presence of TP53 comuta-

TP53 mutation in the alpha-helix

2.3
region was associated with inferior clinical
outcome

Considering that different hotspot p53 mutants that influ-
ence the structure of wt p53 may exert distinct effects
on cancer treatment, we further explored the impact on
the prognosis of different TP53 subgroups. TP53 exon 8
mut had a relatively worse PFS compared with mutations
in other exons (mPFS, 7.4 vs. 10.4 months, p = 0.049;
Figure S1A), while no significant difference was observed
in OS(mOS, 14.8 vs. 21.7 months; p = 0.15; Figure S1B).

When classifying TP53 mutation according to the disrup-
tive/nondisruptive alterations, the PFS (8.5 vs. 11.5 months;
p = 0.50) (Figure S1C) and OS (mOS, 17.8 vs. 18.5 months;
p = 0.86) (Figure S1D) of patients with TP53 nondisruptive
mut and disruptive mut had no difference.

Then, we first paid attention to the influence of the
mutations that affect the secondary structure of TP53 pro-
tein; the mOS of patients with TP53 mutation in α-helix
region, TP53 β-strand region, TP53 loops region, TP53 turn
and other regions were 12.2, 26.6, 15.7, and 21.6 months,
respectively (Figure S2). Notably, we observed that the
mOS of patients with TP53 mut in α-helix region was sig-
nificantly shorter compared with other TP53 mutations
(mOS, 12.2 vs. 21.7 months; p = 0.027) or TP53wt cases
(mOS, 12.2 vs. 29.3 months; p = 0.0006) (Figure 4A).
Patients with TP53 mutation in α-helix region had signif-
icantly worse PFS compared with TP53wt cases (mPFS,
8.0 vs. 16.4 months, p = 0.021) (Figure 4B). Using a Cox
regression analysis, the univariate analysis indicated that
TP53 mutation in α-helix region, TP53 mutation in other
regions, and liver metastases were related to shorter PFS
(Table 2). After multivariate analysis for the endpoint PFS,
TP53 mutation in α-helix region [hazard ratio (HR), 2.05
(1.01–4.18), p = 0.048] and TP53 mutation in other regions
[1.67 (1.02–2.71), p = 0.04] contributed significantly to the
Cox model. Univariate analysis indicated that TP53 muta-
tion in α-helix region, TP53 mutation in other regions, and
liver metastases were associated with inferior OS (Table 2).
Using multivariable regression analysis, both TP53 muta-
tion in α-helix region [HR 3.62 (1.6–8.17), p = 0.002], TP53
mutation in other regions [1.87 (1.06–3.31), p = 0.03] and
liver metastases [HR 1.91 (1.00–3.64), p = 0.049] remained
significant independent predictors of OS.

We also divided the GENIE cohort into patients with
TP53 mutation in α-helix region, TP53 mutation in other
region, and TP53 wt group. For OS analyses, data from
141 patients were available. Consistent with the SYSUCC
cohort, patients with TP53 mutation in α-helix region had
significantly shorter OS compared with TP53 mutation in
other region (mOS, 13.4 vs. 22.8 months, p = 0.049) or
TP53 wt patients (mOS, 13.4 vs. 33.8 months, p = 0.039)
(Figure 4C). OS for patients with TP53 mutation in other
regions and TP53wt was not different (p = 0.21). For PFS
analyses, data from 131 patients were available. No differ-
ence in mPFS was observed between patients with TP53
mutation in α-helix region versus TP53 mutation in other
region (mPFS, 5.0 vs. 4.8 months, p = 0.85) or TP53wt
patients (mPFS, 5.0 vs. 7.1 months, p = 0.52) (Figure 4D).

Poor mOS was observed in patients

2.4
with TP53 mut plus EGFR exon 21 L858R
mutation

To figure out whether different EGFR mutations affected
clinical outcomes, subgroup analyses were conducted
in patients with EGFR T790M mutation, EGFR exon 19
deletion, and EGFR 21 L858R mutation. The mPFS of
patients with TP53 wt plus T790M mut, TP53 wt plus no
T790M mut, TP53 mut plus T790M mut, and TP53 mut
plus no T790M mut were 13.4, 18.8, 9.4, and 9.0 months,
respectively (Figure S3A). The mOS of patients with TP53
wt plus T790M mut, TP53 wt plus no T790M mut, TP53
mut plus T790M mut, and TP53 mut plus no T790M mut
were 29.3, 35.7, 18.5, and 17.8 months, respectively (Figure
S3B). Patients in the TP53 wt subgroup appeared to have

The mPFS of patients with TP53 wt plus EGFR 19del,

for patients grouped by TP53 and EGFR muts indicated
that patients with TP53 mut plus EGFR 21L858R had
the worst mOS (11.5 months) compared with patients
with TP53 wt plus EGFR 19del (29.3 months), TP53 wt

DISCUSSION

In this study, we retrospectively explored two independent
cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with third-generation
EGFR-TKIs to figure out the impact of TP53 comutation.
We found that TP53 mutation was related to worse clini-
cal outcomes. Interestingly, TP53 mut in the α-helix region
was associated with poor OS compared with other TP53
mutations. As far as we know, this is the first study to
explore the effect of TP53 mut in α-helix region on clinical
outcomes.

In SYSUCC and GENIE cohorts, 50.4−63.8% of patients
harbored TP53 comutation, similar to previous studies.15,17

We discovered that TP53 mut was related to inferior
OS and PFS in patients treated with third-generation
EGFR-TKIs, which is consistent with reported studies.15,17
TP53 mutation was also reported to affect the response
and survival of ALK- or ROS1-TKIs treatment.26–28 TP53
mutations that occur with different patterns and/or
distinct comutations could produce interesting functional
and phenotypic ramifications,29,30 while the impact of
different structural TP53 mutations on prognosis remains
unclear. Recently, there has been a succession of studies
exploring the prognostic effect of TP53 mutation subclas-
sification, one perspective being different exons.16,20 TP53

exon 8 mut was reported to be associated with poor OS of
first-generation EGFR-TKIs.16,20 At present, there are not
many studies on the effect of TP53 exon 8 muton clinical
third-generation TKI (Table S3).14–17,31,32
outcomes of
Canale et al.16 reported that mutations in the TP53 exon 8
are related to significantly worse OS. Roeper et al.15 found
no difference between TP53 exon 8 mutation and PFS or
OS, which may be related to the small sample size. In our
SYSUCC cohort, TP53 exon 8 was associated with worse
PFS but not OS after third-generation TKI treatment. The
influence of TP53 exon 8 in third-generation TKIs needs
to be further explored. Another perspective focuses on

the TP53 protein structure, different structured domains
have unique properties and contribute to the functional
diversity of p53.25 Some studies found that TP53 nondis-
ruptive mutations were related to the efficacy of patients
receiving first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment,11,20,33 while
few studies have explored the impact of TP53 disruptive
mut on third-generation TKI treatment.15 Roeper et al.15
observed that the PFS for the TP53 disruptive mutation
was a bit shorter than the nondisruptive mutations group
(8 vs. 11 months). In our study, despite the shorter PFS
observed, the differences between disruptive mutations
and nondisruptive mutations were not statistically differ-
ent. Further exploration is needed on the utility of TP53
disruptive mut in patients treated with third-generation
TKI.

Understanding structural changes can help identify new
therapeutic strategies for people with TP53 comutation.
In our study, we first explored the impact of mutations
related to the secondary structure of protein on clinical
outcomes, including α-helix, β-strand, loop, turn and oth-
ers. We found that TP53 mutations in the α-helix region
had a shorter mOS and verified this finding in another
independent cohort. α-Helix is an important protein
secondary structural unit, which is vital for the structure
and function of the p53 protein.34–36 α-Helix plays a role
in DNA binding motifs, such as zinc finger structure,
leucine zipper, helical-angle-helix, and other motifs.34–36
The composition and sequence of amino acids in protein
molecules have decisive influences on the formation and
stability of the α-helix, thus mutations in amino acid
sequences in these regions are more likely to result in the
instability and interruption of the helix, which can affect
the function of p53.37 Our finding that TP53 mutations
in the α-helix region are associated with poor clinical
outcomes, suggests that this population is of concern,
and the α-helix region may be a potential therapeutic
target. It is worth mentioning that this is only a clinical
finding, which needs to be validated by a cohort with
larger sample sizes, and further mechanistic exploration is
needed.

Some studies have shown that patients with different
EGFR mutation genotypes have different responses to
EGFR-TKIs,38,39 while the effects of concurrent TP53 muta-
tions on TKI efficacy in patients with different genotypes
of mutant EGFR remains unclear. Yu et al.33 reported that
in patients with TP53 comutations who underwent gefi-
tinib treatment, patients harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion
had a longer PFS and OS compared with those with EGFR
L585R mutation. In our study, patients with TP53 mut plus
EGFR L858R had the worst mOS (11 months), which is
consistent with the report of Yu et al.33 However, Canale
et al.16 reported that TKI-treated patients with EGFR exon

19 deletion had shorter PFS and OS than those without 19
deletion. More studies are needed to figure out the relation-
ship between EGFR subtypes and TP53 comutations on the
efficacy of EGFR-TKI.

This study has limitations that must be addressed.
Different sizes of NGS panels were applied since the pan-
els have been developed in the laboratory during the
study process. The effect of TP53 comutations on specific
EGFR-TKIs, including avitinib or almonertinib, remains
unclear and warrants further comprehensive research.
More comprehensive experiments are expected to discover
the potential mechanism behind the mutant p53 that exerts
on the EGFR-TKIs.

CONCLUSION

TP53 comutation was an independent negative predic-
tive factor of poor outcomes in advanced EGFR-mutant
NSCLC patients who underwent third-generation EGFR-
TKIs treatment. Our analyses in two independent cohorts
identified that TP53 mutation in α Helix region was associ-
ated with inferior outcomes. It is expected that more future
studies will explore the impact of structural and functional
differences among specific TP53 mutations on patient out-
comes, which might potentially make TP53 comutated
EGFR-mutant NSCLC more actionable and targetable in
a better precision-based era.

METHODS

5.1

Patient characteristics

We retrospectively collected 223 patients diagnosed with
stage IV NSCLC who received third-generation EGFR-TKI
therapy at SYSUCC from March 2, 2016 to April 16, 2019.
Patients with available sequencing data were included,
who were routinely assessed for targeted genetic alter-
ations using tissue, blood, or pleural effusion samples
before treatment.

Patients were required to have baseline computed
tomography scanning, at least one follow-up computed
tomography scanning, and follow-up information. Base-
line clinical information (age, gender, histology, metastatic
sites, smoking history, details of EGFR mutation, TKI
selection, treatment lines, and current survival status),
medical and imaging records, and patient follow-up infor-
mation were assessed. The protocol and amendments were
approved by the Ethical Committee of SYSUCC (GZJZ-
SB2016-010), and written informed consent was obtained
from patients.

using NGS

EGFR and TP53 mutation screening

DNA was extracted from 5 mL plasma, 200−300 mL
pleural effusion, or 15−20 slides of formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissue. The specific DNA extraction Kit
is based on the actual use of the company, as detailed in
Table S4. DNA sequencing was conducted within three
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified
labs (MyGene, Burning Rock, BGI-Shenzhen) or the cen-
tral laboratory of SYSUCC using NGS. Genomic alterations
included single nucleotide variations, deletions, inser-
tions, copy number variations, and gene rearrangements.
The MyGene panels covered at least 22 cancer-related
genes; the Burning Rock panels covered 168 cancer-related
genes; the BGI panels covered 206 or 508 cancer-related
genes; and the central laboratory of SYSUCC panels cov-
ered 295 cancer-related genes (Table S5). The minimum
coverage across all samples was ≥1000×.40

Disruptive/nondisruptive TP53 mut were classified
according to mutations located inside the key DNA-
binding domain (L2–L3 region) as previously described.8
We also paid attention to the influence of the other sec-
ondary structure of TP53 protein, in which TP53 mut were
classified according to α-helix, β-strand, loop, and turn
and others according to the structural features annotating
online (Table S2, http://p53.fr/tp53-database/mutation-
database and www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P04637).41–44

Research Project GENIE database

American Association for Cancer

The American Association for Cancer Research Project
GENIE registry contains genomic data and clinical data
from thousands of cancer patients.45 Data from the NSCLC
cohort version 2.0_public data were accessed through the
GENIE Biopharma Collaborative Public platform (https://
www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn27056697). Patients with
advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received osimertinib
with tumor genomic data available were included in this
study.

5.4

Response evaluation

Patients were followed up regularly by telephone and
periodic hospital review. Baseline computed tomography
scanning and at least one follow-up imaging test after
the TKI treatment were conducted for response evalu-
ation. Tumor response was evaluated according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria
(RECIST), version 1.1.28. The last patient follow-up was

carried out in May, 2021. PFS was considered as the
time from the start of a third-generation TKI treatment
(osimertinib/avitinib/almonertinib) until documentation
of disease progression or death. OS was considered as the
time from the start of treatment until death. Response to
TKI treatment was analyzed based on EGFR and TP53
mutation status.

5.5

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used for baseline characteristics.
Pearson’s and Spearman’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact
test was used for comparisons between the two groups. The
Kaplan–Meier method model was used to estimate PFS
and OS, and the log-rank test was used to compare PFS
and OS. The Cox proportional regression model was used
to identify prognostic factors, to calculate the HR and cor-
responding 95% CI. A two-tailed level of significance was
set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with
SPSS STATISTICS (version 24.0; IBM Corporation), and R
(version 4.0.5). Plots were generated with GraphPad Prism
(version 7.0; GraphPad Software).
