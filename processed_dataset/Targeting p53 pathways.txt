The TP53 tumor suppressor is the most frequently altered gene in human cancers, and has been a major focus of oncology research.
The p53 protein is a transcription factor that can activate the expression of multiple target genes and plays critical roles in
regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and genomic stability, and is widely regarded as the “guardian of the genome”. Accumulating
evidence has shown that p53 also regulates cell metabolism, ferroptosis, tumor microenvironment, autophagy and so on, all of
which contribute to tumor suppression. Mutations in TP53 not only impair its tumor suppressor function, but also confer oncogenic
properties to p53 mutants. Since p53 is mutated and inactivated in most malignant tumors, it has been a very attractive target for
developing new anti-cancer drugs. However, until recently, p53 was considered an “undruggable” target and little progress has
been made with p53-targeted therapies. Here, we provide a systematic review of the diverse molecular mechanisms of the
p53 signaling pathway and how TP53 mutations impact tumor progression. We also discuss key structural features of the p53
protein and its inactivation by oncogenic mutations. In addition, we review the efforts that have been made in p53-targeted
therapies, and discuss the challenges that have been encountered in clinical development.

INTRODUCTION
The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most frequently mutated
gene in human tumors.1,2 The process of tumor development is
strongly related to the dysfunctions caused by TP53 mutations.3,4
p53 protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, which
regulates a wide variety of pathways, such as cell cycle arrest, DNA
repair, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism,1,5,6 and
determines whether cells die under stress conditions. Over the
years, a growing number of studies have revealed the complexity
and connectivity of the p53 pathway and by extension its role in
metabolic homeostasis,
immune microenvironment, stem cell
biology and so on. However, mutant p53 can alter DNA-speciﬁc
binding, disrupt the spatial conformation of the protein and
thermostability of the protein, and result in dysfunction of p53
activity.7–10

The high frequency of TP53 mutations in tumors and its intrinsic
tumor suppressor function make it a highly promising target for
tumor therapy. However, the speciﬁcity of the p53 structure,11,12
the smooth surface without an ideal drug-binding pocket,13 and
the difﬁculty to restore p53 function, have stalled drug research
against p53 for decades. Nevertheless, researchers still believe that

The discovery history of p53
The TP53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17
(17p13.1) and encodes a protein with 393 amino acid residues.

p53 was initially identiﬁed as a host protein that bound to simian
virus 40 large T antigen in virally transformed cells,14 and was
named p53 in 1979 because its molecular weight was shown to be
approximately 53 kilodalton (kDa)
in SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis analysis15 (Fig. 1). The actual molecular weight of
p53 is 43.7 kDa, due to the large number of proline residues in the
protein that slowed down its migration on SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. TP53 was initially thought to be an oncogene, and
high levels of p53 conferred signiﬁcant tumorigenic potential to
rat embryonic ﬁbroblasts.16,17 Subsequent studies have led to a
change in the recognition of TP53. The initial p53 cDNA was
synthesized using mRNA from tumor cells as a template, and the
p53 cDNA subsequently obtained from normal cells did not
transform the cells, but rather inhibited tumor cell growth.18 In
tumor cells the TP53 gene is often mutated or lost due to
chromosome 17 deletion, whereas in normal cells the gene is
intact.19,20 When a missense mutation in TP53 occurs, the obtained
p53 protein promotes tumorigenic transformation.21,22 TP53
knockout mice have a high probability of developing tumors.23
Overexpression of the wild-type TP53 gene in cells effectively
suppressed the transforming effects exerted on cells by those
oncogenes, such as the MYC gene and RAS gene.22,24 This series of
studies overturned the established paradigm of TP53, which has
since become one of the most studied tumor suppressor genes.

The p53 pathway
p53 is a transcription factor that is distributed in the nucleus and
cytoplasm, binds speciﬁcally to DNA, and regulates a diversity of
genes.25,26 Under normal conditions, cellular p53 protein levels are
very low owing to strict control by its negative regulators MDM2

and MDMX, which promote p53 degradation through ubiquitina-
tion.27,28 When cells are exposed to internal and external stresses,
including DNA damage, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and cancer
cell risk, p53 ubiquitination is inhibited, triggering a rapid increase
in intracellular p53 protein levels. Accumulated p53 is activated
and stabilized by posttranslational modiﬁcations,
including
phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation.29–32 Stabilized p53
forms tetramers in the nucleus, binds to target DNA and regulates
gene transcription, leading to alterations in downstream signaling
pathways.33–37

In response to cellular stress, p53 prevents the differentiation of
cells with mutated or damaged DNA and terminates cellular
processes by transcriptionally activating various genes involved in
apoptosis and cell cycle,38,39 which contributes signiﬁcantly to its
tumor suppressor function and is the most studied.33–37,40–44
Meanwhile, a series of studies have shown that p53 also controls a
number of “non-classical” pathways (Fig. 2), including metabolic
ferroptosis, stem cell differentiation, autophagy,
homeostasis,
senescence, tumor microenvironment and so on.45–50

The biological function of p53 in cancer. p53 controls a wide
range of signaling networks. There is no simple and clear answer
to the question of exactly how, when, and what p53 does.
Nevertheless, what is clear is that p53 has a very ﬂexible and
versatile response, with an integrated response to environmental
perturbations determining cell death or maintaining cellular
homeostasis. p53 serves as a linkage point for multiple cellular
signaling pathways, harmoniously and delicately regulating
various biological
functions through transcriptional regulation
and protein-protein interactions.

Genomic stability: p53 is considered as the guardian of the
It plays an important role in maintaining genomic
genome.
stability. When DNA is damaged, p53 protects the genome by
coordinating multiple DNA damage response mechanisms.51 The
p53 protein activates the expression of DNA repair proteins DDB2
and XPC.52 The interaction of these proteins with effector proteins
may lead to various cell fates, such as apoptosis, senescence or
tumorigenesis.53,54

The gene encoding p21 (CDKN1A) is the ﬁrst transcriptional
target identiﬁed for p53.55 p21 is a potent inhibitor of binding to
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which inhibits cell cycle proteins
and further inhibits phosphorylation of Rb by the cyclin D1-CDK4,
cyclin D2-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes.56–58 Hypopho-
sphorylated Rb forms a complex with the E2F transcription factor,
which inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F and leads to G1
phase block.40,59 PTPRV, which encodes a transmembrane tyrosine

phosphatase, and the phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 are
both genes involved in p53-induced G1 phase block.60,61

In addition, p53 represses CDKs and cyclin B, which are required
for entry into mitosis and are involved in G2/M phase block.62,63
p53 induces transcription of 14-3-3 sigma and represses the cell
cycle protein-dependent kinase Cdc2.64 Gadd45 is a member of
the growth arrest and DNA damage gene family. p53 regulates the
transcription of Gadd45, disrupts the cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex, and
further blocks the G2 phase.63,65 Reprimo is also involved in p53-
induced cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase.66 These modulations of
p53 reduce the risk of gene mutation and prevent the activation
of oncogenes.

On the other hand, p53 can also induce apoptosis in cells with
DNA damage.67 p53 causes apoptosis through transcriptional
activation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, such as
Puma, Bax and Noxa.68–70 p53 is also thought
to regulate
mitochondrial apoptosis through a transcription-independent
pathway.33 p53 binds physically to anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1), thereby indirectly inducing apoptosis.71 p53
directly activates the pro-apoptotic protein Bak or disrupts the
Mcl-1 and Bak complex, releasing Bak and initiating apoptosis.37,72
In addition, p53-driven miR34a expression may sensitize cells to
apoptotic stimuli by decreasing Bcl-2 levels.73,74 In the exogenous
apoptotic pathway, p53 induces the expression of the death
receptors Fas/Fas ligand and KILLER/DR5 located on the cell
membrane, which activates caspase 8 and leads to apoptosis.75,76
p53 also drives the expression of various genes that may have pro-
survival or pro-apoptotic functions,77,78 which also contribute to
the maintenance of genomic stability.

Retrotransposons are replicated and inserted into new genomic
sites by reverse transcription of RNA intermediates, which allows
them to increase the copy number or gene mutations in the host
genome.79 Disinhibition of retrotransposons has been reported to
be closely associated with human tumorigenesis.80 p53 binds to
the promoter region of the retrotransposon element LINE1 and
prevents the expression of transposon sequences.81 When p53 is
absent, cells overexpressing synthetic retrotransposon genes are
able to avoid apoptosis.82 Genomic instability caused by deletion
or mutation of p53 may accumulate more oncogenes and
promote tumorigenesis, proliferation, metastasis and drug resis-
tance. Functional
inactivation of p53 not only contributes to
genomic mutation and copy number increase, but also maintains
the survival of cells carrying faulty genetic information.

Senescence:
Senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest. p53-
mediated senescence is closely related to its tumor suppressive
effects. DNA damage triggers senescence, a process often referred

leading to proteasomal degradation of p53. Under stress conditions, p53 is activated and stabilized by post-translational modiﬁcations.

in G1 arrest or senescence.87 In addition, p53 directly induces
senescence by stabilizing ﬁbrinogen activator inhibitor-1, a marker
of senescent cells.88 p53 also activates the transcription of genes

that encode promyelocytic leukemia protein, leading to cellular
senescence.89

Metabolic homeostasis:
Tumor cells require large amounts of
biological raw materials and energy to achieve their rapid and
sustained growth. The Warburg effect,90 which was ﬁrst proposed,
states that tumor cells metabolize glucose differently than normal
cells, as evidenced by enhanced glycolysis and increased lactate
production.91 p53 regulation of the glycolytic pathway helps
maintain the homeostasis of cellular metabolism and thus acts as
a tumor suppressor. p53 can transcribe target genes required for
oxidative phosphorylation, such as SCO2,92 or genes that inhibit

the pentose phosphate pathway,

glycolysis, such as TIGAR and Parkin.93,94 p53 binds to G6PDH, the
rate-limiting enzyme of
to
further inhibit the activated pentose phosphate pathway in tumor
cells.95,96 p53 inhibits glucose uptake and glycolysis by suppres-
sing the expression and translocation of glucose transporter
proteins such as GLUT1 and GLUT4.97 Glycolysis and gluconeo-
genesis can be considered reversible processes to some extent.
p53 inhibition of glycolysis promotes the process of gluconeogen-
esis.98 Since tumor cells are highly dependent on glycolysis and
the Warburg effect for proliferation and invasion, p53 inhibition of
glycolysis tends to impede cancer cell growth.97,99,100

Cancer cells may indeed activate different metabolic pathways
under different environmental conditions. Mutant p53 activates
the Warburg effect by promoting the translocation of the GLUT1
to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing tumor metabo-
lism.101 Mutant 53 binds and activates PGC-1α, a major regulator
of oxidative phosphorylation, enhancing mitochondrial function
and promoting cancer metastasis.102,103 These studies suggest
that mutant p53 may confer metabolic plasticity to cancer cells,
thereby promote their adaptation to metabolic stress and increase
their potential for proliferation and metastasis.

Since tumor cells need to accumulate or synthesize lipids to
promote growth and proliferation,104 p53 promotes lipolysis
leading to tumor suppression.46 The mevalonate pathway is
responsible for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and nonsteroidal
isoprenoids, and SREBP2 is a major transcriptional regulator of this
pathway.105 p53 blocks the activation of SREBP2 by transcription-
ally inducing the ABCA1 cholesterol transporter gene.105 p53
downregulates the expression of USP19 and SOAT1 to inhibit
cholesterol esteriﬁcation.106 p53 also promotes fatty acid oxida-
tion by activating the expression of CPT1C, MCD and PANK1.107
Ammonia is a prevalent product of cellular metabolism. Tumor
cells produce large amounts of ammonia during amino acid
metabolism, and this ammonia can serve as a nitrogen source for
tumor growth.108,109 p53 regulates ammonia content in tumor
cells through the urea cycle. p53 regulates ammonia content in
tumor cells by inhibiting the expression of three key enzyme
genes in the urea cycle of tumor cells, CPS1, OTC and ARG1, which
ultimately inhibits tumor growth.110

to kill

p53 is also involved in regulating the metabolism of tumor cells
along with other metabolic signaling pathways. Increased levels of
reactive oxygen species in tumor cells have a dual effect, both by
promoting the acquisition of a tumor phenotype and by activating
tumor cells.111,112 The
ROS-dependent death signals
regulation of ROS by p53 also has a dual function. ROS act as an
upstream signal to trigger the activation of p53, and p53 transcribes
the expression of multiple antioxidant genes, such as GPX1 and
manganese superoxide dismutase, to support tumor cell growth or
death.113–115 ROS can also act as a downstream factor of p53 to
drive tumor cell death through apoptosis and ferroptosis.45,116 p53
plays a dual role in inhibiting and promoting the tricarboxylic acid
cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.46,117,118 p53 is also involved in
redox reactions and mediating cancer cell
regulating cellular
death.46,119,120 In addition, p53 is involved in the regulation of
lipid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism.46,121,122

Ferroptosis:
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death initiated
notably by severe lipid peroxidation.123–125 p53 was reported to
inhibit cystine uptake and promote ferroptosis by transcriptional
repression the expression of SLC7A11 which is a key component
the cystine-glutamate antiporter.45,126,127 p53 expression
of
further enhances the ability of GPX4 to antagonize ferroptosis
by increasing the biosynthesis of GSH.127 p53 also regulates
SLC7A11 expression in a non-transcriptional manner. p53(3KR) is
an acetylation-deﬁcient mutant that fails to induce cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and senescence,128 but retains the ability to
regulate SLC7A11 expression.45 Another mutant of p53(4KR) lost
the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression.126 This also suggests

the importance of acetylation of p53 for
the regulation of
ferroptosis. H2Bub1 activates SLC7A11 expression. p53 inhibits
the level of H2Bub1 by promoting nuclear translocation of the
deubiquitinase USP7, which suppresses the expression of SLC7A11
and induces ferroptosis.129

p53 can also activate the expression of SAT1, a rate-limiting
enzyme in polyamine catabolism, thereby inducing lipid perox-
idation and ferroptosis upon ROS stress.130 SAT1-induced ferrop-
tosis is involved in elevated expression levels of the lipoxygenase
ALOX15.130 ALOX12 was also reported to be required for p53-
mediated ferroptosis.131 Moreover, p53 promotes ferroptosis
through modulation of GLS2, PTGS2, FDXR and noncoding
RNAs.132 On the other hand,
interaction of p53 with DPP4
promotes nuclear accumulation of DPP4 and blocks plasma-
membrane-associated DPP4-dependent lipid peroxidation, thus
limiting ferroptosis.133 The p53-p21 axis may contribute to the
inhibition of cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis,134 whereas
it has also been reported that p21 restricts the progression of
ferroptosis in a p53-independent way.135

Tumor microenvironment:
The status of p53 in tumor cells has a
profound impact on the immune microenvironment. p53 reg-
ulates the release of cytokines and stimulates macrophage
polarization toward the M1 phenotype to suppress tumorigenesis.
Macrophages lacking p53 polarize toward M2 and enhance the
proliferation of precancerous cells.136 p53 activation stimulates
cellular anti-tumor responses,137,138 leading to interferon produc-
tion, and there is a synergistic effect between cancer immu-
notherapy.139 Deletion or mutation of p53 in cancer affects the
recruitment and activity of T cells, leading to immune evasion of
cancer cells.47,140 Restoration of p53 expression enhanced the
antitumor effect of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody on hepatocel-
lular carcinoma cells and effectively induced reprogramming of
the tumor microenvironment.141 TP53 mutations are associated
with increased expression of PD-L1, which may be a predictor of
response to PD-L1 targeted checkpoint inhibitors.142 Mutant TP53
contributes to the regulation of tumor cells into an immune
microenvironment that is conducive to growth.143–146

Cancer stem cell self-renewal:
The Rb/p53 signaling pathway
regulates the proliferation and self-renewal process of neuroendo-
crine cells in the early stages of injury.116 Neuroendocrine cells
return to a quiescent state after completing a limited prolifera-
tion.147 However, under conditions of Rb/p53 functional deﬁ-
ciency, neuroendocrine cells can acquire a sustained proliferative
function and develop into small cell lung cancer.148,149 Activation
of p53 in breast,150 prostate,151 epidermis,152 central nervous
system153 and hematopoietic stem cells154–156 hinders stem cell
self-renewal, but the exact mechanism remains to be conﬁrmed.48
p53 has an essential role in regulating normal and malignant stem
cell differentiation and self-renewal. Conversely, mutant p53
contributes to the maintenance of cancer stem cells.157 Mutant
p53 enhances the proliferation of cancer stem cells by regulating
WASP-interacting proteins.158 Mutant p53 also enhances the self-
renewal of hematopoietic cells by upregulating FOXH1.159

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a form of reprogram-
ming of cancer cells.160 Under pathological conditions, epithelial
cells transform into mesenchymal cells, enhancing the invasive
metastasis of cancer cells. p53 directly activates miR-200, miR-130
and miR-34 and inhibits the transcription factors Slug, Snail1 and
Zeb1, which promote epithelial mesenchymal
transforma-
tion.161–164 p53 deletion enhances self-renewal of lung cancer
stem cells.165

Autophagy: Autophagy degrades intracellular macromolecules
through the lysosomal pathway, thereby enabling intracellular
energy supply and organelle renewal.166,167 p53 can directly
activate damage-regulated autophagy regulators and induce

autophagy.168,169 Autophagy is controlled by autophagy-related
genes (Atg).170 Combined ChIP sequencing and RNA sequencing
analysis revealed that p53 binds to many autophagy genes,
including Atg2, Atg4, Atg7 and Atg10.171 This suggests that p53
induces autophagy in a transcription-dependent manner. Cathe-
psin D is a lysosomal aspartate protease and overexpression of
cathepsin D activates autophagy.172,173 p53 binds to two DNA
sites in the cathepsin D promoter region and regulates Cathepsin
D expression.174,175 The upregulation of TGM2 expression by p53
enhances autophagy, thereby inhibiting oncogenic transformation
and tumor formation in primary human mammary epithelial
cells.176

p53 inhibits mTOR and enhances autophagy by activating AMP-
responsive protein kinase.177–179 The p53 target genes Sestrin1
and Sestrin2 phosphorylate and activate AMPK and promote
autophagy.178 p53 induces mitophagy by increasing the level of
BNIP3.180 Interaction of beclin1 with Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic
proteins inhibits autophagy.181,182 p53 promotes the expression of
BH3-only protein, which competitively binds to Bcl-2 family anti-
apoptotic proteins, contributing to the restoration of beclin1
activity and promoting autophagy.181,183

p53 also functions as an inhibitor of autophagy. When p53 with
deletion of nuclear localization sequence accumulates in the
cytoplasm, it inhibits autophagy.184,185 HMGB1 and p53 regulate
autophagy by mutually regulating their distribution in the nucleus
and cytoplasm.186,187 In addition, autophagy regulates p53 activity.
Atg7 inhibits p53 activation and p53 induced apoptosis.188

Other cellular processes:
The signaling pathways involved in the
regulation of p53 also include immune responses, non-coding
RNAs and so on that exert tumor suppressive effects.49,87,189–192 In
tumor development, p53 suppresses tumor

signals in the environment.

p53 is essential for suppressing cancer in humans. However, a
study in 2019 showed that p53 could promote tumor growth by
enhancing the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinoma cells117
(Fig. 3). p53 transcription activates Puma expression, which further
initiates apoptosis.69 But certain levels of Puma protein interfere
in
with normal mitochondrial
mitochondrial energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation
to glycolysis.117 Another group knocked out MDM2 in hepatocyte-
speciﬁc KRAS G12D mutant mice and observed p53 accumulation
in mouse hepatocytes.196 These p53-activated mice exhibited
increased inﬂammatory responses, hepatocyte apoptosis, and
senescence-associated secretory phenotype,
leading to the
facilitation of a carcinogenic microenvironment196,197 (Fig. 3).
Hepatic progenitor cells from p53-accumulating mice were
injected into experimental mice growing tumors. The develop-
ment of hepatocellular carcinoma and other related phenotypes
no longer occurred after knockdown of TP53, suggesting that p53-
accumulated mice do promote the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma.196 Cellular activities regulated by p53 are integrated
into tumor suppressive functions, but p53-induced regulation of
certain elements may also provide a survival advantage for tumors
(Fig. 3).

TP53 mutations in cancer
The TP53 gene is mutated in most
tumor cells. Genome
sequencing of different human cancer cells showed that 42% of
cases carry TP53 mutations.198 The major type of mutation in TP53
is a missense mutation, a single amino acid substitution and the
DNA binding domain (DBD)
is the most common mutated
region199,200 (Fig. 4a, b). p53 mutants are usually classiﬁed as
structural mutants and DNA contact surface mutants. Structural
mutants (R175H, R249S, G245S, Y220C) have reduced protein
thermostability, resulting in proteins that do not fold properly at
physiological temperatures and lose the ability to bind to DNA.
Among them, R175H and C176Y affect the binding of protein to
zinc ions. DNA contact surface mutants (R273H/C, R248W) are

dominant-negative (DN) effects but may also be converted to
oncogenic proteins via gain-of-function (GOF).203,205,206 Thus, TP53

rectum (44.55%),
lung (40.8%), pancreas (38.53%), stomach
(36.78%), urethra (35.01%), liver (29.17%), breast (26.44%), prostate
(22.52%), bone (16.19%), thyroid (11.13%), hematopoietic and
lymphatic
(https://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic). TP53 was mutated more frequently
in esophageal carcinoma (93.77%), small cell lung cancer (79.06%),
ovarian carcinoma (80.46%), colorectal carcinoma (74.45%) and
gallbladder carcinoma (57.77%), and less frequently in thyroid
carcinoma (3.13%), embryonal
(2.08%) and peripheral
nervous system (1.25%). Different tumor subtypes of the same
tissue and organ also have different TP53 mutation spectra. For
example, the frequency of TP53 mutations in non-small cell lung
cancer was 57.04%, which was lower than that in small cell lung
cancer (79.06%) (https://www.cbioportal.org/).
In addition, TP53
mutation spectra differed by race. The frequency of TP53

Mechanism of action of mutant p53.
TP53 acts as a tumor
suppressor gene and genome guardian, so cancer cell transforma-
tion is unlikely to occur
in cells that maintain normal p53
function.212,213 TP53 mutations provide a permissive environment
for tumorigenesis.214,215 TP53 mutations are a hallmark of an

Li-
Fraumeni.216,217 The high frequency of TP53 mutations found in
tumor cells19,218,219 may be the result of selection pressures that
favor tumor cells to escape surveillance and be spared from
death.220,221 Many mutant p53 proteins are more stable than wild-
type p53 proteins and can accumulate in cells. Some mutant p53
proteins may have completely different functions than wild-type
proteins,222 and this effect may be due to altered target gene
proﬁles, mutant p53 secretome or inappropriate protein-protein
interactions223 (Fig. 5).

Loss of p53 transcriptional activity of mutant p53, and to some
extent the DN effect are major drivers of the tumor phenotype
(Fig. 5). The loss-of-function or DN effect of wild-type p53
enhanced the viability of
tumor cells, and this effect was
independent of missense mutations in TP53.193 The deletion of
TP53 in gastric cells combined with an oncogenic diet confers a
selective advantage to cancer cells.224 Analysis of more than
10,000 patient samples from 32 different cancers in The Cancer
Genome Atlas revealed that more than 91% of mutant p53 was
accompanied by deletion of TP53 alleles.225 Mutations in TP53 are

associated with enhanced chromosomal instability,226,227 and are
accompanied by ampliﬁcation of oncogenes and deletion of
suppressor genes.227,228 Signiﬁcant upregulation of proteins
associated with cell cycle progression was also observed in p53
mutant cancers, which may be due to loss of control of cell cycle
checkpoints by TP53 deletion.225,229,230 Scott W. Lowe’s group
used a mutation tracking system to reveal a pattern of TP53
inactivation leading to genomic alterations.231 Although TP53-
deﬁcient cells gain the potential for cancer cell transformation,
TP53 deletion alone is not sufﬁcient to cause cancer.231 TP53-
deﬁcient cells gain additional gene ampliﬁcation in an ordered
way that eventually spirals out of control and develops into
cancer.231–234 Functional, DNA binding and transcriptional ana-
lyses against myeloid malignancy cell lines carrying TP53 missense
mutations showed loss of p53 function, indicating that DN is the
primary choice for TP53 missense mutations in myeloid malig-
nancies.235

The activity of the p53 mutant GOF has been reported to be
associated with cellular physiopathology and poor clinical out-
comes in cancer patients236–246 (Fig. 5). Mutant p53 binds directly
to TBK1, prevents TBK1 from forming a ternary complex with
STING and IRF3, and ultimately inhibits the activation of the cGAS-
STING pathway.223 Mutant p53 helps tumor tissue evade the
killing effect of the immune system by inhibiting the anti-tumor
immune response.223,247,248 However, in contrast, the evidence on
the effects of p53 mutant GOF is much weaker compared to DN,
and it may act modestly or only in certain speciﬁc situations.

Mutated TP53 not only lost its normal biological function, but

also promoted cancer metastasis. Missense mutations in TP53
were associated with lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer
patients.249 TP53 R175H and R273H mutations occurred in more
metastatic tumors than in TP53 knockout mice.250,251 In mouse
models of pancreatic cancer that speciﬁcally express oncogenic
KRAS and mutant TP53, more than twice as many metastatic
lesions were observed as in TP53 knockout mice.252 Lung
adenocarcinoma mice carrying TP53 and KRAS mutations are
highly aggressive and metastasize to multiple sites of intrathoracic
and extrathoracic in a pattern similar to that of human lung
cancer.253 Similarly, TP53 gene deletion induces an increase in
systemic neutrophils, which drive systemic inﬂammation with
breast cancer cell metastasis.194

Mutant p53 can lead to treatment

resistance in cancer.
Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P-glycopro-
tein), encoded by ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1, has
been shown to be resistant to cytotoxicity and chemotherapy.254 In
p53 mutant R248Q-expressing Hep3B cells, expression and activity
of the multiple drug resistance gene, P-glycoprotein, are elevated
mediating doxorubicin resistance.255 Acetylated mutant p53
interacts with p300 to promote transactivation of ephrin-B2 and
enhances ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 levels,
thereby promoting chemoresistance.256
In R273H-expressing
human squamous cell carcinoma cells, multidrug resistance to
doxorubicin, methotrexate and apoptosis-inducing drugs was
shown due to downregulation of procaspase-3 levels.257 Wild-
type p53 inhibits LRPPRC expression via miR-34a, further reducing
MDR1 expression. However, when TP53 is mutated, chemotherapy-

THE STRUCTURES OF P53
The comprehensive function of p53 is closely related to its
modular structure of typical signaling proteins.201 Human p53 is a
multidomain protein that consists of 393 amino acids.259 It
contains an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD, residues
1–61), a proline-rich domain (PRD, residues 64–92), a DNA-binding
domain (DBD, residues 96–292) linked to a tetramerization domain
(TET, residues 324–356), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD,
residues 364–393)260,261 (Fig. 4b). More than 40% of the regions
within p53 are intrinsically disordered,
including the TAD, CTD,
and the linker between DBD and TET.262 These disordered regions
allow p53 to interact as a modular protein with a wide range of
partner proteins. These structured and unstructured domains
individually have unique properties and contribute to the overall
functional diversity and complexity of p53. Due to the intrinsic
ﬂexibility of the intact protein, the high-resolution structure of full-
length p53 remains unclear.

N-terminal region
The N-terminal region of p53 contains a highly acidic, intrinsically
disordered TAD and a proline-rich region.263 TADs, including TAD1
(residues 1–40) and TAD2 (residues 40–61),264 can bind to
transcription machinery components and transcriptional coactiva-
tors to promote transcriptional initiation and interact with negative
regulators to suppress transcriptional activation. TAD can adopt an
amphipathic α-helical conformation upon binding of partner
proteins,259 which seems to be an essential binding mode, as seen
in the structures of TAD bound to the negative regulator MDM2265/
MDMX266 (Fig. 6a), transcription coactivator CBP267,268/p300269,270

like conformation when bound to subunit p62 of human TFIIH275
(Fig. 6c). Phosphorylation of TAD has been shown to serve as a
switch to rapidly turn p53 function on and off but also as a
mechanism for a graded p53 response.276,277 Overall, the conforma-
tional plasticity of
together with posttranslational
modiﬁcations, makes p53 a highly efﬁcient transcription factor.

the TAD,

The proline-rich region linking the TAD to DBD is required for
p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.278,279 This region
plays a role in signal transduction by binding to Src homology 3
domains.280 The PRD is also involved in interactions with focal
adhesion kinase (FAK),281 peptidase D,282 ASPP family mem-
bers,283 and the corepressor protein mSin3a.284 The PRD contains
ﬁve PXXP motifs, some of which may adopt a polyproline helix-like
structure.259 The exact structure and interaction mechanism of
PRD are largely unknown.

DNA-binding domain
The structured DBD adopts a basic scaffold of an immunoglobulin-
like β-sandwich, a loop-sheet-helix motif (loops L1, S2, and S2’,
parts of the extended S10 and H2), and two large loops (L2 and
L3) that are stabilized by a tetrahedrally coordinated zinc ion285
(Fig. 7a). The DBD is responsible for binding sequence-speciﬁc
target DNA, which is central to the biological function of p53 as a
transcription factor.
In addition, the DBD is also capable of
interactions with diverse proteins.

DNA recognition.
In response to a wide variety of stress signals,
p53 regulates the transcription of many different genes involved
in various pathways. p53 also acts as a pioneer transcription factor,
binding to speciﬁc DNA sequences in the nucleosome to promote
transcriptional activation in chromatin.286–288 Most p53 target
genes contain a consensus response element (RE) composed of
two decametric half-sites of RRRCWWGYYY (R = A, G; W = A, T;

Y = C, T) separated by 0–13 base pairs.289–292 Some REs are cluster
sites that have more than two half-sites. p53 also binds a set of
noncanonical DNAs, such as cruciforms, left-handed DNA (Z-DNA),
quadruplex and triplex DNA.293,294

Various structural studies have demonstrated the molecular
mechanism of DNA recognition by p53 (Fig. 7a). Brieﬂy, the residue

hydrogen bond contacts with bases via key residues Lys120, Cys277
and Arg280.285 Residues Ala276, Ser241 and Arg273 contribute to
DNA backbone contacts. p53 binds to a full consensus DNA
response element as a tetramer through a highly cooperative self-
assembling mechanism (Fig. 7b). Two DBDs bind each decameric
half-site as a symmetrical dimer (A-B), and two such dimers (A-B and
C-D) constitute a tetramer on a full DNA response element via
protein-protein and base stacking interactions.11,70,295–299

Upon DNA binding,

the DBD and the DNA helix undergo
structural changes. The binding of p53-DBD to the BAX response
element causes DNA deformation, which is partially disordered
around the spacer region, leading to unwinding and compression of
the region to allow protein-protein interactions.70 In some p53/DNA
structures,
the central A-T doublet of each half-site shows
noncanonical Hoogsteen base-pairing geometry instead of standard
Watson-Crick base pairs.299,300 Some p53/DNA structures reveal that
loop L1 of two p53 subunits adopts a conformational switch from an
extended conformation where Lys120 interacts directly with DNA to
a recessed conformation where there is no direct DNA contact.301
The conformational switch is related to the DNA-binding speciﬁcity
of p53. Acetylation of
loop L1 residue Lys120 expands the
conformational space of loop L1 in the DNA-bound state and
promotes sequence-dependent DNA-binding modes for p53.302

various activities of p53. An increasing number of structures of
the DBD/protein complex have been determined, providing fresh
perspectives on the mechanisms of p53-DBD binding and
functional diversity.

By using a yeast two-hybrid system, 53BP1 and 53BP2 (namely,
the C-terminal fragment of ASPP2) were initially identiﬁed to bind
to p53.303 They interact with p53-DBD through the L3 loop and L2
loop304–306 (Fig. 7c, e). 53BP1 plays multiple roles in DNA damage
and repair and has been reported to enhance p53-mediated
transcriptional activation of ASPP2. The inhibitory member iASPP
belongs to the apoptosis-stimulating p53 protein (ASPP) family,
which has opposite functions in regulating the apoptotic function
of p53.307 Unlike ASPP2, iASPP preferentially binds p53-PRD283 and
interacts with the DBD through the L1 loop, helix H2 and
N-terminal loop308 (Fig. 7d). The L1 loop of p53 moves away from
other DNA-binding modules upon binding iASPP, which disables
Lys120 from making contact with a speciﬁc base.308 The different
binding interfaces with the ASPP family provide insight into the
opposing regulatory mechanism of p53.

Cytoplasmic p53 has been reported to regulate the mitochon-
drial apoptosis pathway by inhibiting antiapoptotic BCL-2 and
BCL-xL.
In a structural model of BCL-xL/p53 characterized by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and determined
using the HADDOCK docking method based on 1:1 stoichiometry,
the BCL-xL binding surface of p53-DBD largely overlaps with the
DNA-binding surface and encompasses helix H1 and the Zn2+-

coordination site309 (Fig. 7f). However, the recently determined
crystal structure of the p53/BCL-xL complex indicates that p53
binds BCL-xL with a 2:1 stoichiometry71 (Fig. 7g). Two p53-DBD
molecules dimerize through the N-terminal loop and β9-β10 loop
of one p53-DBD and the Zn2+-coordination site of the other p53-
DBD,
involving residues Tyr107 and His178, respectively. The
resulting p53-DBD dimer forms a groove and interacts with one
BCL-xL to form a ternary complex. The DNA-contacting residues
Arg248 and Arg273 form direct hydrogen bonds with BCL-xL. The
binding mode is distinct from other p53-DBD binding proteins.

The p53-DBD is also targeted by viral oncoproteins, such as the
large T antigen (LTag) of simian virus 40 (SV40)310 (Fig. 7h) and
human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E6311,312 (Fig. 7i). LTag
promotes viral replication and cellular transformation. It occupies
the entire DNA-binding surface of p53-DBD and interacts with a
region of helix H1 that is involved in p53-DBD dimerization. The
p53-binding site of HPV E6 substantially overlaps with the binding
surface of iASPP, which has been reported to inhibit HPV E6-
induced degradation of p53.308

Some of these proteins bind p53 at a surface overlapping with
the DNA-binding site, such as 53BP1, ASPP2, Bcl-xL and LTag.
Some partner proteins bind at a surface distal from the DNA-
binding site, such as iASPP and HPV E6. Notably, the p53 hotspot
mutant alleles at residues Arg248 and Arg273 not only make
direct contact with DNA but are also involved in direct contact
with ASPP, BCL-xL and LTag. Another hotspot residue, Arg282, is
involved in iASPP binding. Thus, these hotspot mutants may have
multiple hits on p53 activities.

Tetramerization domain
Full-length p53 reversibly forms tetramers through the TET. The
structural analysis demonstrated that monomeric TET is a
V-shaped structure composed of a β-strand and an α-helix linked
by hinge residue Gly344313–315 (Fig. 7j). The primary dimer relies
on eight backbone hydrogen bonds of the β-sheet and is also
stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Phe328, Leu330,
Ile332,
Phe338 and Phe341) as well as a salt bridge between Arg337 and
Asp352.35 The dimer-dimer interactions are primarily mediated by
hydrophobic contacts (Met340, Phe341, Leu344, Ala347, Leu348
and Leu350).35 R337C/H/P and L344P affect the formation and
transcriptional activity of p53 tetramers and are involved in Li-
Fraumeni Syndrome and Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndrome.316 The
G334V mutant contributed to a beta-dominated structural
transition leading to amyloid formation at physiological tempera-
ture.317 A highly conserved leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)
within the TET is necessary for the subcellular localization of
p53.318 Some proteins bind directly to TET, but no complex
structure has yet been demonstrated.319

The C-terminal regulatory domain
Similar to the NTD, the CTD is also an intrinsically disordered
region. This characteristic endows it with multiple regulatory
functions in almost every aspect of p53, including DNA binding,

cofactor recruitment, cellular localization, and protein stabiliza-
tion.320 The CTD possesses many positively charged residues,
which are highly conserved in mammals. Extensive posttransla-
tional modiﬁcations of the CTD, including acetylation, methylation
and phosphorylation, play an essential and interdependent role in
its function and stability (Fig. 7k). The CTD adopts different
conformations depending on the binding partners and post-
translational modiﬁcations201,321 (Fig. 7l–o).

Full-length p53
The highly intrinsic unfolded regions within p53 make it difﬁcultt
to determine the high-resolution structure of full-length p53. A
4.6 Å resolution structure of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with full-
length p53,322 has shown that the DBD targets the upstream DNA-
binding site within Pol II, and the following TET is exposed on top
of the DBD. The TAD distal to the DBD forms helices and binds Pol
II’s jaw that contacts downstream DNA (Fig. 7p). This association
II, providing insight
introduces a conformational change in Pol
into the p53-mediated regulation of gene expression.

How an intact p53 tetramer interacts with DNA and proteins is
still largely unclear. A combination of NMR, electron microscopy,
small-angle X-ray scattering, and FRET techniques indicates that
the free p53 tetramer in solution forms an open cross-shaped
structure with a pair of loosely coupled DBD.323,324 The oligomers
close to form a compact complex upon binding a speciﬁc DNA
response element. Chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry
methods are also employed to study the structural dynamics of
full-length p53.325 A recent study has reported cryo-electron
microscopy of p53-DBD and full-length p53 complexed with a
nucleosome, in which the DBD binds as a tetramer to the DNA and
peels the DNA from the histone surface.288 The N-terminal and
C-terminal regions were not observed in the cryo-EM maps, but
biochemical analysis suggests that the C-terminus of p53 may
contain an additional DNA binding domain.288

STRUCTURE-BASED P53 TARGETING
Structural and biochemical analyses have provided insight into the
function of p53. However, many important questions regarding
the structure‒function and speciﬁc regulation of p53 remain to be
determined.

much structural information has been obtained about the binding
of p53 to ligands. From this critical information, structure-based
design strategies can be applied to optimize the structure and
thus improve activity and selectivity.

MDM2/MDMX-p53, a central hub for p53 activation
MDM2/MDMX is the major negative regulator of p53.334 In the
MDM2-p53 negative feedback regulatory loop, wild-type p53
activates the transcription of MDM2, while the N-terminal of
MDM2 binds to p53-TAD and represses the transcriptional activity
of p53.265 In addition, the C-terminus of MDM2 has the enzymatic
activity of E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes the nuclear export
and degradation of p53.335,336 MDMX (or MDM4), a homolog of
MDM2, is structurally similar to MDM2, but it lacks ubiquitin ligase
activity and can enhance the ubiquitination activity of MDM2 by
forming a dimer with MDM2.337,338 Overexpression or activation of
MDM2/MDM4 is present in many human tumors, leading to p53
inactivation.334,339,340 Many antitumor drugs targeting MDM2/
MDMX-p53 interactions have been developed in recent years (Fig.
8, Table 1).

MDM2-p53 inhibitor.
The cocrystal structure of p53-TAD with
MDM2 shows that Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26 on the α-helix of p53
penetrate deeply into the hydrophobic cleft of MDM2 (Fig. 8a, b),
with Leu22 providing additional van der Waals forces.265 These
structural features of the p53/MDM2 complex provide a basis for
ﬁnding inhibitors that block the interaction between these two
proteins.

RG7112: Based on the structural features of p53/MDM2, research-
ers synthesized imidazole-like MDM2 antagonists, among which
RG7112 is the ﬁrst small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2 to enter the
clinic. The crystal structure showed that the 4-chlorophenyl ring
occupied the Trp23 and Leu26 pockets, while the ethoxy group was
prominently located in the Phe19 pocket341 (Fig. 8d). RG7112 had a
Kd = 2.9 nM. It effectively blocks p53-MDM2 binding and promotes
cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.342 However, the ability of
RG7112 to induce apoptosis in cancer cells varies widely. The best
responses were observed in MDM2 gene-ampliﬁed osteosarcoma
cell lines and xenografts.341,343

The MDM2 inhibitor RG7388, which was subsequently
designed and synthesized, is a class of pyrrolidine derivatives.344

potently inhibits the MDM2-p53 interaction.342 Structural analysis
the “cleft” of Gly58 may provide additional
revealed that
assistance for the small molecule to bind MDM2.350 The crystal
structure shows that the isopropyl group, C6 aryl group and C5
aryl group occupy the three major binding pockets of p53,
namely, Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26, respectively. Meanwhile, the
imidazole group of His96 formed π-π stacking interactions with
the C5 aryl group and formed hydrogen bonds with carbox-
ylate.342 In addition, the isopropyl group extends into the “cleft” of
Gly58, forming CH·O-type interactions with Gly58 and enhancing
contacts with nearby hydrophobic residues350 (Fig. 8f). In tumor
cells with high MDM2 expression, AMG232 enhances p53 activity
and inhibits tumor growth.351 AMG232,

immune checkpoint drugs, also enhances T-cell-mediated tumor
killing.352 However, high doses of AMG232 may trigger gastro-
intestinal side effects, neutropenia and leukopenia, which requires
further study.353

SAR405838 (MI77301), Ki = 0.88 nM, is an optimized
SAR405838:
spiro-oxide compound that blocks the MDM2-p53 interaction and
prevents p53 degradation.354 SAR405838 mimics the three key
amino acid residues of p53 and forms hydrogen bonds with the
His96 residue of MDM2 at different chemical groups, generating
π-π stacking, as seen in other MDM2 inhibitors. The structural
differences are that SAR405838 mediates the refolding of the
MDM2 N-terminus (residues 10–18) and interacts extensively with
Val14 and Thr16. Moreover, the hydroxy-cyclohexyl group forms a
hydrogen bond with Lys94354 (Fig. 8g). These structural features
allow SAR405838 to achieve a tight binding and high speciﬁcity
for MDM2. SAR405838 activates the p53 pathway, increases the
expression of PUMA and P21, and induces complete tumor
regression in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma xenograft mice.354 The safety
of SAR405838 alone355 or in combination with MEK inhibitors356
has been established, but the drug activity is limited, and TP53
mutations may occur with long-term administration.357

NVP-CGM097: NVP-CGM097,
novel
dihydroisoquinoline-like MDM2 inhibitor obtained by virtual
screening and structural optimization.358 The cocrystal structure
revealed that in addition to the three key amino acids that mimic
the interaction between p53 and MDM2, the isopropyl ether
group also forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Tyr100,
Gln24 and Phe55. NVP-CGM097 induced a conformational change
in Phe55; thus, Phe55 formed a π-π stacking interaction with the

a

dihydroisoquinolone core (Fig. 8h). NVP-CGM097 exhibits high
selectivity for wild-type p53 and shows potent antiproliferative
ability in colorectal cancer and osteosarcoma cells with wild-type
p53.358 NVP-CGM097, combined with MEK inhibitors, activates the
MAPK signaling pathway and attenuates acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) cell load.359 When combined with BET or Cdk4/6
inhibitors, NVP-CGM097 induces cell death in neuroblastoma or
ER-positive breast cancer cells.360,361

MDM2/MDMX-p53 inhibitor.
The main features of the MDM2-p53
interaction are preserved in the MDMX-p53 structure, but the
central hydrophobic cleft of p53 peptide binding in MDMX is
smaller and differently shaped than that of MDM2 (Fig. 8a–c).
Therefore, many small molecule drugs targeting MDM2 do not
bind MDMX well.

ALRN-6924: Currently, there are no inhibitors that act on MDMX
alone, but one stapled peptide, ALRN-6924, binds both MDM2
(Kd = 10.9 nM) and MDMX (Kd = 57 nM).362 In AML cells, ALRN-
6924 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and signiﬁcantly
prolongs the survival of AML model mice.362 ALRN-6924 is well
tolerated in phase I clinical trials in patients with solid tumors and
lymphomas carrying wild-type p53.363 However, molecular simu-
lations reveal that ATSP-7041, an analog of ALRN-6924, may bind
to the p53 coactivator p300 and isolate free p300, thus reducing
the transcriptional activity of p53.364 This mechanism needs
further investigation.

(Table 1). Although the speciﬁc interaction sites are unknown, they
all
induce cell death in a variety of tumor cells, particularly in
patients with MDM2 ampliﬁcation and intact p53 expression. APG-
115 was the ﬁrst MDM2 inhibitor to enter the clinic in China and
was granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. APG-115 interrupts the p53-MDM2 interac-
tion, increases the abundance of MDM2 in T cells, and plays a
critical biological role in maintaining T-cell stability, survival, and
antitumor immunity.371

In addition, researchers designed Proteolysis-targeting chimera
(PROTAC) degraders based on MDM2 inhibitors.375 WB156,
consisting of a nutlin derivative linked to the CRBN ligand
lenalidomide, effectively depleted MDM2 and activated wild-type
p53, thereby inducing apoptosis.376,377 The rapid degradation of
MDM2 by MD-224 resulted in complete tumor regression in
leukemia cells carrying wild-type p53.378

Overall, the design and development of drugs targeting MDM2/
MDMX-p53 is a hot spot and priority in the ﬁeld of oncology drug
research worldwide. However, the speciﬁcity of MDM2/MDMX-p53
protein interactions poses a great difﬁculty in the development of
small molecule inhibitors. Although some MDM2 inhibitors have
entered clinical trials, there are currently no marketed drugs, and it
is hoped that structure-based guidance will lead to new break-
throughs for MDM2-p53 inhibitors.

Tackling the p53 mutation
tumor
Under normal conditions, wild-type p53 suppresses
regulation and protein-
development
protein interactions. However,
in many situations, missense
mutant p53 is expressed at high levels in tumor cells, partly due
to the inability of mutant p53 to induce gene expression of
MDM2,379 which supports the reactivation of mutant p53 as a
therapeutic option.5 Most TP53 mutations are missense mutations
located in the DBD.3,4,203,205,380 p53 mutants mainly affect the
thermostability of p53 protein, structural stability (structural
mutants such as 175, 220, 245 and 249) or p53-DNA contact
(DNA contact mutants such as 248 and 273). Therefore, a number
of small molecule compounds, peptide or antibody drugs
targeting p53 mutants have been developed to recover the
native conformation or normal function of the p53 protein.381–385

Broad-spectrum mutant p53 rescue compounds.
Employing library
screens, structure-based design and other methods, drugs or
compounds were discovered to have effects on the thermo-
stability, speciﬁc DNA binding capacity or transcriptional activity of
p53 mutant proteins. Some of them were initially identiﬁed as p53
mutant activators, but as research progressed, it was discovered
that they could also exert antitumor activity independent of
p53 status (Tables 2–3).

PRIMA-1 and APR-246: PRIMA-1 and APR-246 are prodrugs that
are converted into the bioactive compound methylene quinucli-
dinone (MQ). PRIMA-1 was obtained by screening a library of
compounds.386 PRIMA-1 restores the wild-type conformation and
DNA contact of p53 mutants, and induces transcription of the
downstream target genes BAX, P21 and PUMA.386–388 After PRIMA-
1 treatment of SKOV-His-175 cells, a 46% increase in folded p53
protein was observed using the p53 conformation-speciﬁc
monoclonal antibody PAb1620.386 Further studies revealed that
APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met, eprenetapopt), a methylated derivative of
PRIMA-1,389 has stronger antitumor activity and fewer toxic side
effects than PRIMA-1, and inhibits the growth of p53 mutant
tumors of various origins in combination with other anticancer
drugs.390–396 Tumor cell lines carrying TP53, TP53 mutations, or
TP53 deletions responded to APR-246 treatment.397–400 However,
growing evidence suggests that APR-246 exerts its effects through
a multitude of pathways independent of p53,401–404 such as
downregulating glutathione concentrations in tumor cells,405,406

regulating oxidation-reduction homeostasis407–409 in tumor cells
to trigger ferroptosis,410–412 and inducing endoplasmic reticulum
stress413 or unfolded protein responses.414

Clinical and preclinical data showed that the combination of
APR-246 and azacytidine (AZA) showed synergistic activity in
patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), AML and solid
tumors carrying TP53 mutations with an acceptable safety and
tolerability proﬁle.415–420 Food and Drug Administration and
European Medicines Agency have granted APR-246 orphan drug
status and FTD for the treatment of MDS carrying the TP53
mutation. Aprea Therapeutics recently announced preliminary
data from its Phase III clinical trial. In a cohort of 154 intention-to-
the complete remission rate for APR-246 in
treat patients,
combination with AZA was 33.3%, compared to 22.4% in the
AZA alone group. Although the complete remission rate was
higher with the combination,
reach statistical
signiﬁcance (https://www.aprea.com). Data from another clinical
study could explain this phenomenon. Decitabine alone (a
hypomethylating agent, similar to AZA) was able to produce a
very high response rate (100%) in patients with AML or MDS
carrying a TP53 mutation.421 This suggests that the therapeutic
effect of the hypomethylating agent may be dominant in myeloid
malignancies carrying TP53 mutations.

MQ can covalently bind to cysteine to restore the function and
conformation of mutant p53. MQ is a very active Michael receptor
that preferentially and reversibly binds to the soft nucleophile
cysteine thiol of p53.422 Theoretically, all cysteines exposed on the
surface of p53 are potential modiﬁcation sites of Michael addition
reaction285,423 (Fig. 9a). Computational docking indicated that
Cys124, located in the center of the L1/S3 pocket of the p53 core
region, may be the site of the MQ modiﬁcation.424 In 2021,
Degtjarik and colleagues investigated the mechanism of MQ
reactivation of mutant p53 based on structure.425 Based on the
DNA contact surface mutant R273H/R273C and the structural
mutant R282W, six cysteines, Cys124, Cys182, Cys229, Cys273,
Cys275 and Cys277, were identiﬁed to bind to MQ. Among them,
the formation of new hydrogen bonds between MQ-Cys277 and
DNA stabilizes the protein‒DNA interface, while MQ-Cys124 and
MQ-Cys229 stabilize the local conformation and support the p53
dimer interface (Fig. 9b). MQ-Cys182, MQ-Cys275 and MQ-Cys273
are only observed in the structures absent from DNA, and seem to
be incompatible with DNA binding. These conjugates form
intramolecular interactions or intermolecular interactions with
neighboring p53 molecules, stabilizing a p53 dimer different from
that in p53-DNA tetrameric complexes. Therefore, MQ shows great
diversity in reacting with p53 cysteines, while it worth considering
whether each conjugate is beneﬁcial for p53 rescue. Theoretically,
MQ can bind to any exposed cysteine and GSH can also bind
covalently to MQ,411 which may be one of the reasons for the
antitumor activity of MQ.

ATO: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a traditional Chinese medicine that
leads to complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL).426 The speciﬁc fusion protein PML-RARα is present
in more than 98% of APL patients. One of the mechanisms by
which ATO treats APL is its ability to bind directly to the cysteine in
the zinc ﬁnger structure of the fusion protein, mediating the
ubiquitinated degradation of PML-RARα.427 Subsequently, a series
of reports showed that ATO induced apoptosis in tumor cells
carrying TP53 mutations.428–430

Lu Min’s team found that ATO could help stabilize the structural
mutation of p53 (R175H) and restore the cancer suppressive
activity of p53.431 The crystal structure showed that the DNA-
binding domains of Cys124, Cys135, Cys141 and Met133 formed
an As-binding pocket, with direct interaction of arsenic with
Cys124, Cys135 and Cys141 and van der Waals forces between the
side chain of Met133 and the arsenic atom (Fig. 9c). Most
structural p53 mutants were rescued to varying degrees by ATO,

but mutations in the DNA contact surface (R248Q, R273H) were
not observed. ATO increased the thermostability of structural
mutant p53 by 0.9–6.5 °C, restored the protein folding state close
to wild-type, and increased transcriptional activity by several fold
to 44-fold. Studies on hematologic tumors showed that ATO
signiﬁcantly prolonged the median survival time in mice; and
studies on solid tumors showed that ATO-treated mice had only
10–20% of the tumor volume of the control group.431

(Kd = 9.09 μM)

Subsequently, the Lu Min’s
Potassium antimony tartrate (PAT):
team screened compounds for temperature-sensitive p53 mutant
proteins, using thermostability as a criterion for rescue. Potassium
antimony tartrate (PAT) was identiﬁed as binding to the p53
V272M mutant
in a non-covalent manner,
increasing its thermostability by 3.6 °C and remarkably restoring
protein folding and transcriptional activity.432 PAT is an antipar-
asitic agent that has been used as a treatment for leishmania-
sis,433,434 and has
since been found to have antitumor
activity.435,436 PAT is similar to ATO in that both can induce
apoptosis in APL cells.437,438 PAT and ATO bind to mutant p53 at
similar sites (Fig. 9d), but differ in two aspects, with PAT non-
covalently binding mutant p53 and preferentially rescuing
temperature-sensitive mutants (a subtype of structural mutants),
whereas ATO covalently binding mutant p53 and apparently
rescuing more structural p53 mutants.432 Notably, the ATO and
PAT studies comprehensively and experimentally compared the
representative mutant p53-rescuing compounds. PAT
set of
exhibited speciﬁc p53 V272M antitumor activity in both cellular
and xenograft mouse models. Further testing identiﬁed 65 of p53
mutants that could be rescued by PAT, but all were non-hotspot
mutations.432 A clinical trial of antimony for the treatment of MDS/
AML with TP53 mutations is currently underway.

ZMC1: Zn2+ is crucial for DNA recognition by p53. Zn2+ can help
stabilize the interaction between p53 and DNA by tetrahedral
coordination with the imidazole group of H179 and the thiol
groups of Cys238, Cys242 and Cys176298 (Fig. 9c, d). Conversely,

the lack of Zn2+ affects the correct folding and DNA recognition of
the p53-DBD protein.439 Therefore, helping zinc ions to bind in the
correct position may be an effective strategy to target p53.

R175H is one of the p53 hotspot mutations and is classiﬁed as a
Zn2+-binding mutation. The binding afﬁnity of DBD-R175H to
Zn2+ was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to that of wild
type.440,441 On the basis of this hotspot mutation, NSC319726,
also known as ZMC1, was identiﬁed from 48129 compounds.441
ZMC1 helped coordinate zinc ions at appropriate sites to restore
the structure and function of the R175 mutant442 and signiﬁcantly
inhibited tumor growth in mice carrying the R175H mutation.441
ZMCI treatment increased the folded R175 mutant protein by
twofold.442 ZMC1 acts as an ionophore,443 transferring zinc ions
from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm, maintaining the
cytoplasmic zinc ion concentration within an appropriate range
and thus reactivating the p53 mutant.444–446 In addition, ZMC1
can chelate redox-active copper,447 increase intracellular reactive
oxygen levels and decrease glutathione concentrations to exert
antitumor effects.441,444

Salim et al. identiﬁed a thiosemicarbazideb
Other compounds:
compound COTI-2 that showed inhibitory activity in a variety of
tumors by using a computational platform.448 COTI-2 inhibits
tumor growth in a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner,
ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.448–450 COTI-2
was reported to restore DNA-binding properties to the p53-
mutant protein,449,451–453 whereas it is obscure whether COTI-2
can physically bind p53. COTI-2 is currently in phase I clinical trials
for the treatment of gynecologic malignancies or head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas.

There are also small molecule drugs that have not been
structurally studied but may interact with the cysteine residues of
p53-DBD and restore the wild-type conformational and transcrip-
tional function of p53. CP-31398 was screened from a library of
>100,000 compounds originally identiﬁed to rescue the mutant
p53.454–456 However, subsequent studies have shown that CP-
31398 does not interact with p53-DBD or full-length p53, but
rather acts as an intercalator and may interact with p53 during
biosynthesis. CP-31398 inhibited ubiquitination and degradation
of p53457 and activated BAX independently of p53 to promote
apoptosis of tumor cells.455 Molecular docking structures revealed
that STIMA-1,458 MIRA-1459–461 stictic acid424 and UCI-LC0023462
could bind in the L1/S3 pocket of p53-DBD, probably to the thiol
group of Cys124 in this transiently opened pocket.424

Some of these broad-spectrum mutant p53 rescue compounds
have been reported to bind p53-DBD cysteine, helping restore the
correct
folding and thermostability of mutant p53. Complex
structures show that MQ can bind to six of the ten cysteines,425
while ATO431 and PAT432 bind at a pocket formed by Cys124,
Cys135, Cys141 and Met133. p53 has ten cysteines in its DBD (Fig.
these cysteines are all potential sites for
9a). Theoretically,
modiﬁcation. Amino acids exposed on the surface of p53-DBD,
Cys182, Cys229 and Cys277, are the most susceptible sites for
modiﬁcation. Cys182 and Cys229 are located on the p53 dimer
contact surface and modiﬁcation of these two sites may cause
non-functional artiﬁcial dimers.463 Cys277 is located on the DNA
contact surface and modiﬁcation of this site may result in spatial
site blocking that inhibits p53 binding to DNA.463 Cys176, Cys238
and Cys242 are relatively unlikely to be modiﬁed, as they involve
the coordination of a zinc atom.298 Besides, Cys124, Cys135,
Cys141 and Cys275 are located in the p53-DBD core region, which

in restoring the
structure and function of mutant p53.

Allele-speciﬁc mutant p53 rescue compounds
The Y220C mutation in p53 is a relatively speciﬁc
Y220C:
mutation. Y220 is far from the site where p53 binds to DNA,
while the tyrosine mutation between S7/S8 becomes cysteine,
forming a hydrophobic cavity on the p53 surface.464,465 Therefore,
targeting the hydrophobic pocket of Y220C becomes an ideal
drug target, helping p53 to restore normal
folding without
interfering with p53 binding to DNA.466 Several small molecules
have been shown to bind to the hydrophobic pocket of Y220C
and restore p53 function467–478 (Tables 2–3, Fig. 10a–i).

C14586 is the ﬁrst orally bioavailable mutant p53 protein-
selective reactivator that selectively binds to the cleft produced by
the p53 Y220C mutant protein, thereby restoring wild-type p53
protein structure and tumor suppressor function.479 Preclinical
trials have shown that continuous oral administration leads to
complete tumor regression in 80% of mice.479 An ongoing clinical
phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor
activity of C14586 in adult patients with advanced or metastatic
solid tumors with the Y220C mutation.480

The hot spot mutation Y220C is a particularly suitable target site
for structure-based drug design. The mutant p53 temperature
sensitivity can be repaired by small molecule drugs, and the cavity
that appears due to the mutation is also a good target for small
molecules. Structure-based drug design and optimization may

lead to new strategies for patients with tumors carrying the p53-
Y220C mutation.

Targeting p53 aggregation. p53 is a temperature-sensitive
its structural stability is compromised,
protein. Once mutated,
exposing adhesion sequences encased in the hydrophobic core of
p53, which drives the formation of p53 aggregates,481 thereby
depriving p53 of its DNA recognition function and proapoptotic
capacity482,483 (Tables 2–3, Fig. 11). Amyloid aggregates caused by
TP53 mutations have been found in biopsy specimens from
ovarian and breast cancers.484,485

ReACp53:
The formation of p53 aggregates is considered to be an
amyloid lesion, where two β-sheet layers stack in parallel to form a
tight complementary spatial zipper, forming amyloid ﬁbrils mainly
through hydrogen bonding interactions between the main and side
chains of the β-sheet layer.486,487 Several research groups have
reported similar sequence positions as highly adherent fragments of
p53 (251–258, ILTIITLE) (Fig. 11). p53 mutations result in reduced
p53 stability and expose the highly adherent fragment that drives
p53 aggregation, which is effectively inhibited by the I254R
mutation.457,488,489 Soragni et al. designed a cell-penetrating peptide
(named ReACp53) that inhibits amyloid aggregation of the mutant
p53 protein and restores the transcriptional function of p53 and its
ability to induce mitochondrial apoptosis.490 ReACp53 treatment
increased the nuclear localization of mutant p53 by 70–100% and
approximately doubled the transcriptional activity.490

Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the binding
characteristics of the ReACp53 peptide to the R175H mutant p53-

T cells and releasing cytokines to kill tumor cells. The interacting amino acid residues are shown as sticks. Hydrogen bonds as black lines

DBD.491 The results
show that ReACp53 has hydrophobic
interactions with residues Leu188 and Leu201 and forms salt
bridges or hydrogen bonds with residues Asp186, Glu198, Asp204,
Glu 221 and Glu 224, which prevent the aggregation-prone region
(residues 182–213) from being exposed. In addition, the complex
formed by the ReACp53 peptide and the R175H mutant p53-DBD
has the same positive net charge as wild-type p53. The
aggregation of p53 was inhibited by electrostatic repulsion.491
ReACp53 also inhibits the growth of various tumors characterized
by p53 mutations.490,492–494

ReACp53 inhibits the aggregation of mutant p53 to rescue p53
function, but it is clear that its non-p53 targets are also present in
cancer cells. In p53-silenced cells, the response of ReACp53 was
not abolished, and addition of this peptide to p53-silenced two-
dimensional cultured cancer cells resulted in rapid apoptosis.495
Thus, although ReACp53 was designed as a mutant p53 rescue
compound, its exact mechanism of action and targeting in tumors
and whether it acts primarily by targeting p53 need to be further
elucidated.

ADH-6: ADH-6, Kd = 366 nM,
is a cationic tripyridylamide
obtained by screening the oligopyridylamide library.496 Previous
studies have reported that these α-helix-like mimics can mimic
the secondary structure of proteins and effectively regulate
amyloid aggregation497,498 (Fig. 11). Using NMR spectroscopy,
ADH-6 was shown to bind not only p53-prone aggregation sites
but also multiple regions of p53-DBD, including sheet 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
and helix 2. Subsequently, researchers also found that ADH-6
dissociated p53 mutant aggregates and selectively induced
apoptosis in multiple p53 aggregation-prone mutated cancer
cells (R248W, R248Q, R175H, R273H, Y220C and R280K).
In
addition, the unfolded state of mutant p53 was reduced by
24–50% after ADH-6 treatment of cells, and the expression of
downstream target genes p21, Noxa and BAX was signiﬁcantly
increased.496

LI/LH. Miller et al. designed two bifunctional ligands (LI/LH) based
on other compounds that bind amyloid proteins.499 LI and LH have
the same structural features except for an iodine substituent at the
ortho position. The iodine atoms may form halogen bonds that
bind to exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues and regulate
the aggregation of p53 (Fig. 11). LI and LH acted as metallocha-
perones binding to zinc ions, which increased the intracellular zinc
ion level and improved the binding ability of zinc ions to mutant
p53, thus regulating mutant p53 aggregation. LI and LH also
increased the expression of Noxa and p21 by 1.5 to 4.3-fold.
Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy observation con-
ﬁrmed that mutant p53 could signiﬁcantly inhibit the formation of
aggregates when cocultured with LI.499

(Fig. 11). The p53 aggregates

HDAC6/Hsp90 inhibitors: Mutant p53 aggregates not only
induced wild-type p53 aggregates but also coaggregated with
p63 and p73495,500
led to
upregulation of Hsp70 and Hsp9098 (Fig. 11). Hsp70 inhibited
MDM2-mediated degradation of mutant p53 ubiquitination and
led to transient exposure of p53 adhesion sequences, increasing
the formation of p53 aggregates.501 The interaction between
Hsp90 and mutant p53 prevented the ubiquitinated degradation
of mutant p53 protein.502 Thus, disruption of the HDAC6/Hsp90
complex by HDAC inhibitors503 or Hsp90 inhibitors504 induces
degradation of the p53 mutant.

Peptide and antibody drugs targeting protein interactions. Peptide
drugs and antibody drugs are characterized by high speciﬁcity
and good safety proﬁles. With the maturation of biotechnology,
an increasing number of peptide and antibody therapeutics are
beginning to emerge that can bind to mutated p53 and restore
the function of the p53 mutant (Tables 2–3). However, although
peptide drugs can enter cells to restore p53 function, it is difﬁcult
to maintain stability and function after entering the human
body.505,506

the edge of

CDB3: A nine amino acid peptide, CDB3, was designed based on
the p53 binding protein 53BP2 region (490–498).507 The NMR
structure showed that CDB3 interacts with multiple sites in the
DBD region, concentrated between loop 1, helix 2 and sheet 8,
located at
the DNA-binding site and partially
overlapping with the DNA-binding site.507 Further experiments
revealed that CDB3 could bind to G245S and R249S structural
mutants,508 restore conformational folding,509 improve the afﬁnity
of the β-sheet I195T mutant to DNA, and restore the transcrip-
tional activation function of p53 (R175H, R237H). Upon binding of
CDB3 to mutant p53, the p53 protein is activated, and target
genes compete for the position of binding CDB3, which in turn is
released back into the cell and continues to target other
mutants.507,510

pCAPs: A series of p53 conformation-activating peptides, or
pCAPs, were identiﬁed using phage display technology. Despite
the absence of clear structural information, pCAPs were shown to
bind to misfolded p53 mutants,
forcing p53 conformational
recovery and activating transcription of p53 downstream target
genes. Signiﬁcantly reduced mouse tumor size in mouse xenograft
models of breast, ovarian and colon cancer.511

from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.512–514

The amphipathic penetrating peptide p28 contains twenty-
p28:
eight amino acids
It
preferentially enters cancer cells and inhibits their proliferation
by stabilizing the expression of p53.515 p28 forms a complex with
the DBD of p53, and structural simulations show that the main
binding sites of p28 are in the nonmutagenic loop L1 (amino acids
112–124) and the mutagenic loop L7/L8 regions
(Y220C,
P223L).516 p28 inhibits the interaction between the E3 ligase
COP1 and p53,517 improves the posttranslational stability of p53,
and increases p53 protein expression in various p53 wild-type or
mutated tumor cell lines.518,519 These results provide foundational
evidence that p28 performs well
in phase 1 clinical trials in
patients with various p53 wild-type or mutant tumors.520–522

Nb3 and Nb139: Nanobodies containing only a heavy chain
variable region (VHH) but still retain antigen speciﬁcity and high
afﬁnity523 have proven their value in cancer therapy and diagnosis
in recent years.524–526 Two p53-binding nanobodies, Nb3 and
Nb139, were obtained by immunization and panning proce-
dures.527 Nb3 binds to the “structural mutations” R175H and
R282W, and Nb139 binds to both wild-type and mutant p53,
inhibiting the transcriptional capacity of p53. The cocrystal
structure shows that
the three complementary determining
regions (CDRs) of Nb139 interact with p53-DBD by forming
backbone or side chain hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces
(Fig. 12a). Compared with the wild-type p53 structure, the Nb139/
p53-DBD complex maintains the structural and DNA-binding
properties of p53, which provides an innovative approach to study
p53.527

H2-scDb: Mutant p53 is hydrolyzed intracellularly to produce a
peptide known as a mutation-associated neoantigen that can be
presented on the cell surface after forming a complex (pHLA) with
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins.528,529 In two patients
with metastatic epithelial carcinoma carrying the p53R175H
identiﬁed the neoantigen as the
mutation, Malekzadeh et al.
HMTEVVRHC peptide, which can be recognized and formed into a
complex by HLA*02:01530 (Fig. 12b). To exploit this tumor-speciﬁc
surface antigen, the researchers screened the antibody fragment
library and optimized the design to identify a TCR-mimetic
antibody in the form of a single-chain double antibody (scDb) with
Kd = 86 nM.529 The structure revealed that the p53R175H peptide
occupies the binding cleft between α1 and α2 of HLA-A*02:01. The
His175 amino acid residue in the p53R175H peptide fragment plays
a signiﬁcant role in direct contact with H2-Fab. The imidazole side

chain of His175 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp54 (CDR-H2) and
Tyr94 (CDR-L3) and forms a π-π stacking interaction with Tyr52
(CDR-H2) (Fig. 12b). Functionally, H2-scDb bound speciﬁcally to
the p53R175H/HLA complex and efﬁciently induced T-cell immune
responses. In multiple myeloma xenograft mice carrying p53R175H,
H2-scDb effectively regressed tumors.529

Second-site suppressor mutation. Mutant p53 usually affects the
binding of p53 to DNA or the conformation of p53. Second site
suppressor mutations could help correct the conformation of
mutant p53,
improve the stability of p53-DNA binding, and
provide a theoretical basis for the reactivation of mutant p53
(Table 4).531–545

Crystal structures show that the second-site suppressor muta-
tions usually cause only small local structural changes, whereas do
not alter the overall structure of the p53 protein.534,536,545,546
These second-site suppressor mutations act through two types of
mechanisms: supplying a new DNA-contacting amino acids when
rescuing DNA-contacting mutants, or increasing thermostability
when rescue structural mutants.537,547 These mutants provide the
basis for designing drugs that restore the transcriptional inactiva-
tion and instability of p53 caused by mutations.

Other therapies
The TET and CTD have essential roles in the proper folding and
functional regulation of p53. There are no drugs that speciﬁcally
target
these two structural domains. A synthetic peptide
(361–382) extracted from the p53-CTD region (361–382, peptide
46) can interact with the DBD and CTD regions of p53,548 and the
addition of different concentrations of peptide 46 restores the
DNA binding ability of p53 mutants (R273H, R248W, R175H, R249S,
V143A).549 The fusion of the p53 protein with the N-terminal
the p53
spider silk domain contributes to the stability of
protein.550 The therapeutic effects and speciﬁc mechanisms
targeting these two structural domains need further exploration.
Researchers have also developed innovative therapies that
target mRNA for protein degradation. For example, a speciﬁc
the
deoxyribozyme (DZ-249A) has been designed to target
mutation site of TP53 to degrade the mRNA of mutant TP53,
thereby reducing the expression of the mutant p53 protein.551,552
Combination therapy of multiple mechanisms is also a promising
strategy;
for instance, the combination of MDM2 and BCL-2
inhibitors can effectively induce apoptosis.553,554 Moreover, gene

targeting p53.

Therapeutic strategy for truncated p53
Nonsense mutations cause proteins to terminate or end transla-
tion earlier than expected, generating truncated proteins. A total
of 8.19% of TP53 mutant tumors were detected to carry nonsense
mutations and were cleared by the nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD) machinery during transcription555,556 (Fig. 1a).
Currently, there are two approaches to rescue truncated p53.557
One is to restore production of full-length p53 protein by drug-
induced read-through of the premature termination codon. For
instance, G418 and NB124 can stably promote the expression of
full-length p53 protein.558,559 The other
is the inhibition of
NMD.560,561 However, NMD is a potent cellular surveillance
mechanism562 and non-speciﬁc inhibition of NMD may do more
harm than good.

Therapeutic strategy for p53 isoforms
Fourteen isoforms of p53 have been identiﬁed: p53, p53β, p53γ,
Δ40p53, Δ40p53β, Δ40p53γ, Δ133p53, Δ133p53β, Δ133p53γ,
Δ160p53, Δ160p53β, Δ160p53γ, Δp53, and p53ψ.563–568 It was
shown that Δ133p53 activates the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein
and antagonizes p53-induced apoptosis.563 p53Ψ cannot bind to

induces the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition
markers and enhances the viability and invasiveness of cancer
cells.565 Overexpression of Δ133p53α facilitates the long-term
propagation of primary epithelial cells in vitro.569 These evidences
suggest that some p53 isoforms are in marked contradiction to
the function of wild-type full-length p53, exhibit oncogenic
effects, and support cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
Therefore, rescue therapy may not be appropriate for these p53
isoforms, and targeted degradation may be a better strategy to
remove their oncogenic effects, such as PROTAC,570 ATTEC,571
AUTAC,572 and LYTAC.573

CONCLUSION
The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in humans. In
the 40 years since the discovery of p53, new insights have been
made into the gene regulatory mechanisms and tumor suppres-
sion pathways of p53. We have learned about an elaborate and
complex tumor suppression network, but have not yet discovered
its accurate and complete picture. Based on the relationship
between the structure and function of p53 and cancer develop-
ment, many anticancer drugs targeting p53 have been developed.
However, there are no approved drugs to date.

Summary points
Among the molecules developed to target p53,
two main
mechanistic approaches have been implemented. One is to target
wild-type p53 and inhibit the p53/MDM2 complex to prevent its
degradation. To date, eleven MDM2 inhibitors are in clinical trials.
However,
long-term administration of an MDM2 inhibitor may
induce acquired resistance related to TP53 mutations and
increased MDMX expression.574,575 There is still a lack of MDM2/
MDMX dual-target or speciﬁc MDMX inhibitors. Moreover, the
accumulation of p53 in normal tissues may produce greater toxic
effects.353

The second is to target p53 mutants. Many therapeutic
approaches aim to rescue the function of mutated p53 through
small molecule compounds. The development of p53 mutant-

Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  

 (2023) 8:92 

rescuing drugs has been hampered by false trials that have proven
not to be reproducible in other labs or to function by p53-
unrelated pathways. Some drugs were initially identiﬁed as p53
mutant activators, but it remains puzzling whether they actually
rely on p53 for their action. For example, CP-31398 was initially
thought to maintain the wild-type conformation of the mutant
p53,454 but was shown to be unable to bind p53 in a different
lab.455 Dr. Soragni states on her website that “we don’t really know
what the mechanism is for ReACp53 to kill cancer cells” (http://
alice.mbi.ucla.edu/reacp53.html). This may be because most
experiments to rescue mutant p53 drugs are performed in cells,
and the lack of
interaction of
compounds with proteins leads to our incomplete understanding
of the mechanism of drug action. Most of the currently reported
drugs that activate p53 mutants have p53-independent antitumor
effects. It is undeniable that these drugs do act to rescue mutant
p53 function, but it may be ambiguous which is more effective,
whether it is mutant p53-dependent, mutant p53-independent, or
both. The ﬁeld of targeting mutant p53 remains a shimmering
light after the dawn, and we see hope, but there is still a long road
of discovery to go.

information on the direct

The availability of structural data on p53 mutants and their
complexes with drugs, combined with data on the functional
rescue of the mutants, has helped to understand the rescue
mechanism and optimize drug design. For example, a special
class of p53 structural mutant, Y220C,
leads to a hydrophobic
cavity in p53 protein structure.467 Small molecules are designed
to target this cavity to stabilize the protein structure. ATO431 and
PAT432 bind to an allosteric site exposed within the p53 mutant
protein and help stabilize the local structure. They are likely to be
effective for structural mutants or temperature-sensitive mutants,
but not DNA contact mutants. Those mutations at the DNA
contact surface tend to beneﬁt from small molecules that have
the ability to restore protein-DNA binding. The structures of MQ
with p53 mutants R282W, R273H and R273C show that the
binding of MQ with Cys277 supports the p53-DNA interface by
complementing additional
interactions, while MQ interaction
large diversity by binding to some other
modes exhibit

cystines.425 In addition, structural analysis illustrates the basis of a
TCR-like antibody H2-Fab speciﬁcally targeting the p53R175H
peptide-HLA interaction.529 Nevertheless, structural
information
about p53 mutants and their complexes is still insufﬁcient, so we
need more structural
insights to help target p53 mutants for
rational drug design.

Challenges and perspectives
There are signiﬁcant challenges in the development of drugs
targeting p53. The lack of an established mechanism for protein
reactivation and the lack of pockets (except in the case of Y220C)
are the two main reasons. It is relatively easy to inhibit protein
function by simply using compounds to occupy their active sites,
but elusive as to how compound binding leads to reactivation of
protein function. In addition, resistance to TP53 mutations, the off-
target effects of the drug, and the possible toxic side effects of
p53 accumulation in normal tissues, all make p53 difﬁcult to drug.
full-length p53 in complex with
Currently,
different DNA targets and full-length partner proteins remain
unavailable. Certain p53 mutants cannot be expressed, and their
structures are not available, which limits structure-based drug
design. In recent years, there have been great advances in cryo-
electron microscopy, and artiﬁcial
intelligence. With these
technological advances, we have reason to believe that the
structural study of p53 will make more progress in the near future,
which will provide a structural basis for the development of p53-
targeted drugs.

the structures of

For p53-targeted therapy, several other factors also need to be
considered. First, TP53 mutations are heterogeneous and not all
mutations are equal. Hence a one-drug-ﬁts-all approach may not
targeting TP53 mutations.12,576,577 Therefore,
be feasible for
different p53-targeting drugs may be required for different p53
mutants. Second, p53-targeted therapy alone may not be
sufﬁcient to treat cancer. Combination therapy, such as simulta-
neous blockade of
the MDM2-p53 pathway and p53-BCL-2
pathway, may have a synthetic lethal mechanism. Third, there
are some other new therapeutic directions that may be explored,
such as targeting p53 mRNA, targeting disordered structural
domains, targeting mutant protein for degradation, and genome
editing using CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing
technology has been applied to cancer treatment.578,579 With
the advancement of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the correction of
TP53 mutations using CRISPR-Cas9 may become an effective
cancer treatment option in the future.

For decades, there has been a lack of effective progress in the
development of drugs
targeting p53, and p53 was once
considered to be an undruggable target. As technology advances,
many undruggable targets are becoming druggable, such as
KRAS.580,581 We have reason to believe that drugs targeting p53
will also make progress. Given the prevalence of TP53 mutations in
human cancers, drugs targeting p53 may bring a breakthrough in
cancer therapy.
