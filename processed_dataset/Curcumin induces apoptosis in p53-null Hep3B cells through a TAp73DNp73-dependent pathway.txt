Abstract Curcumin has anticancer functions in various tu-
mors. It has been shown to induce apoptosis through p53-
dependent pathways. p73 gene is a member of the p53 family
which encodes both a tumor suppressor (transactivation-com-
petent p73 (TAp73)) and a putative oncogene (dominant-
negative p73 (DNp73)); the former shares similarity with the
tumor suppressor p53, and the latter behaves as dominant-
negative proteins that interfere with the activity of TAp73. To
understand the p73-dependent mechanisms that are engaged
during curcumin-induced apoptosis, we established a p73
overexpression cell models using p53-deficient Hep3B cells
(Hep3BTAp73/DNp73). Our results demonstrated that curcumin
at concentrations of 40 and 80 μM induced DNA damage,
increased TAp73/DNp73 ratio, and also led to apoptosis in the
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells. The apoptotic cell death was concur-
rent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; re-
lease of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and the cleavage of
caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). These results demonstrated a p73-dependent mecha-
nism for curcumin-induced apoptosis that involves the
mitochondria-mediated pathway.

Introduction

Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the dried
ground rhizome of the perennial herb curcuma species
Curcuma longa. Curcumin has been used for centuries in
traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. Recent studies show
that curcumin possesses potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxi-
dant, chemo-preventive, and chemo-therapeutic activities [1,
2]. In vitro treatment, curcumin suppresses the proliferation
of a variety of cancer cells, including carcinomas of the
breast, prostate, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, brain, and
lung [3–7].

The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that is
activated by cellular stresses such as DNA damage and onco-
gene stimulation [8]. Upon activation, p53 may induce cell
cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis
[9, 10]. Thus, p53 acts to maintain genome stability and
eliminate damaged or abnormally proliferating cells. Follow-
ing cellular stresses, p53 is stabilized and binds to DNA as a
tetramer, in a sequence-specific manner that results in the
transcriptional activation of a series of target proteins includ-
ing p21, BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL-2 antago-
nist killer, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) [11–14].
Previous studies have also demonstrated important roles for
p53 in curcumin-induced apoptosis. For instance, curcumin
can induce human HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cell apopto-
sis by activating p53 and regulating apoptosis-related protein

expression [15, 16]. In another case, curcumin treatment can
improve the general health of patients with colorectal cancer
via the mechanism of increased p53 molecule expression in
tumor cells and consequently speeds up tumor cell apoptosis
[17]. Unfortunately, loss of p53 function is the most common
event during tumorigenesis in diverse types of human cancer;
thus, many tumor cells lack the functional p53 [18, 19].
However, little is known about the function of curcumin in
p53-mutant (or deficient) cancer cells.

p73, as a p53 family member, is also responsive to the
DNA damage that leads to apoptosis [20, 21]. The p73 gene
encodes two isoforms that differ in their N-termini and which
can be functionally classified as transactivation-competent
(TAp73) and dominant-negative (DNp73) proteins [22, 23].
The TAp73 shares similarities with p53 with regard to DNA
damage-induced apoptosis through its activation of p53-
responsive genes [24, 25]. The DNp73 has a very important
regulatory role, as it exerts a dominant-negative effect on p53
and TAp73 by inhibiting their transactivation activity. Thus,
DNp73 confers drug resistance to tumor cells harboring p53
and/or TAp73 [24]. Its inhibitory function is exerted either at
the oligomerization level, or by competing for binding to the
p53/TAp73 DNA target sequence [26]. In addition, the
DNp73 promoter contains an efficient p53/TAp73-
responsive element that can be transactivated by p53 and/or
TAp73, and therefore creates a dominant-negative feedback
loop that regulates the function of p53 and/or TAp73 [27, 28].
Several lines of evidences indicate that the presence and
participation of different spliced forms of p73 might be one
reason for the different cell fates observed in response to DNA
damage [29, 30]. However, it is still unknown whether TAp73
and/or DNp73 participates in curcumin-induced apoptosis.

Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a key initia-
tive step in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, and the release
of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol is funda-
mental to apoptosome formation and initiator caspases (such as
caspase 9) and executioner caspases (such as caspase 3) acti-
vation [31]. The activated caspase 9 and caspase 3 in turn
cleave a variety of cellular substrates, most notably
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) [32]. One of the most
important functions of PARP is to help repair single-strand
DNA nicks. Thus, cleaved PARP is a useful marker of
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [33].

In this current study, we sought to analyze the p73 roles
during curcumin-induced apoptosis. Using the p53-deficient
and little p73 expression Hep3B cells, we first established a
curcumin-induced apoptotic model. Then, we carried out a set
of analyses assessing cell viability, percentages of apoptotic
cells, extent of DNA damage, and mitochondrial membrane
potentials (MMP). Finally, we analyzed the protein levels of
TAp73, DNp73, pro-caspase 9, cleaved caspase 9, pro-
caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, pro-PARP, cleaved PARP, and
cytochrome c. Our results, as detailed below, suggest that

there exists a p53-independent but p73-dependent apoptotic
pathway in response to curcumin exposure, which is mediated
through the mitochondrial pathway.

Materials and methods

Reagents

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal
bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco Invitrogen
Corp. (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY, USA). 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT), curcumin, and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The nucleus/nucleus-free cytosol
protein isolation kit was supplied by KeyGEN (Nanjing,
China). Expression plasmids for human TAp73 and DNp73
have been described previously [34]. Primer sequences were
5-TGCTGTACGTCGGTGACC-3 (sense DNp73), 5-CGAC
GGCTGCAGAGCGAG-3 (sense TAp73), and 5-TCG AAG
GTG GAGCTGGGTTG-3 (antisense for both). TAp73,
DNp73, and β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Messenger
RNA (mRNA) extracted kit and SYBR Green I mix (for
quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)) were supplied by Qiagen and
Invitrogen, respectively. Caspase 9 and caspase 3 antibodies,
as well as IRDye-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse sec-
ondary antibodies, were purchased from Bioworld Technolo-
gy (St. Louis Park, MN, USA). Cytochrome c antibody and
the mitochondria-free cytosol protein isolation kit were sup-
plied by Boster (Wuhan, China), and the annexin V-
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) apo-
ptosis detection kit was obtained from MultiSciences Biotech-
nology (Hangzhou, China).

Cell culture and treatment

Hep3B cells were supplied by the Cell Bank of Type Culture
Collection of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai,
China). Hep3B cells were cultured in DMEM medium which
contained 10 % (v/v) FBS. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in
a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Curcumin was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a stock solution (final
concentration: 80 mM).

Establishment of TAp73- and DNp73-overexpressing Hep3B
cells (Hep3BTAp73/DNp73)

For transfection of the plasmid, Hep3B cells were seeded at
3×105 per well in six-well plates. Then, the adherent cells
were trypsinized by 0.25 % trypsin and diluted in the DMEM.
Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was diluted into
Opti-MEM I medium (final concentration: 5 %) and incubated

containing 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton X-100,
10 mM Tris-HCl, and 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine sodium, pH 10.
Slides were placed in an electrophoresis unit for 40 min to
allow DNA to relax in the electrophoretic solution consisting
of 300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA, pH>13, at 4 °C. Then,
the slides were subjected to electrophoresis (4 °C) for 20 min
at electric field strength of 0.86 V/cm, 25 V, 300 mA. After
electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized in 0.4 M Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5). DNA was stained with PI at a concentration of
2 μg/ml. Slides were analyzed using a fluorescence micro-
scope (Olympus) equipped with a UV-1 filter block at 360 nm
connected to the computer-based image analysis system
CASP-Comet Assay Software. One hundred images were
randomly selected from each sample, and the olive tail mo-
ment (OTM) was measured.

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential

MMP was measured using the rhodamine 123 fluorescent dye
according to the method described previously [37]. Loss of
MMP results in the release of rhodamine 123 from the

at room temperature for 10 min. The plasmids were also
diluted into Opti-MEM I medium (final concentration
50 nM). Diluted Lipofectamine 2000 transfection agent and
diluted plasmid were combined and incubated at room tem-
perature for an additional 20 min. The transfection mixture
was added to six-well plates. Cell suspensions were overlaid
onto the transfection complexes. After 6-h incubation, the
medium was removed and the cells were cultured in normal
medium. Q-PCR and Western blotting were performed to
validate the transfected efficiency.

Assessment of cell viability

Cell viability was determined by the mitochondrial-dependent
reduction of MTT as previously described [35]. Both Hep3B
and Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
5×103 cells per well. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells
were treated with curcumin at concentrations of 10, 20, 40,
and 80 μM. At 24 h after treatment, the supernatant was
removed and 100 μl (500 μg/ml) MTT solution was added
to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MTT
solution from each well was removed. A volume of 150 μl
DMSO was added, and the plates were shaken for 5 min to
dissolve formazan crystals. The optical density at 570 nm for
each well was determined using a microtiter plate reader
(BioTek, Winooski, VT). Cell viability was represented as
the absorbance of treated sample/absorbance of control
group×100 %.

Measurement of cell apoptosis

The percentage of apoptosis for the two cell lines were ana-
lyzed by staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide.
Both of the cells were seeded in six-well plates at 4×105 cells
per well. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of
curcumin, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in buffer
containing 1 % (v/v) annexin V-FITC and 2 % (v/v) propidium
iodide and incubated in the dark at room temperature for
10 min. Analysis was performed using a flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the charac-
teristics of cells were analyzed by ModFit software (Verity
Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).

Assessment of DNA damage

DNA damage was assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis
(comet assay) [36]. Briefly, at the end of the curcumin treat-
ment, cells were re-suspended in 0.75 % low melting point
(LMP) agarose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4)
and placed on microscope slides pre-coated with 0.5 % normal
melting point (NMP) agarose. To prevent additional DNA
damage, all the steps were conducted under reduced light or
in the dark. Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a buffer

mitochondria into the cytosol and a resulting increase in
intracellular fluorescence [38]. At the end of the curcumin
treatment, a total of 1×106 cells were harvested and incubated
with rhodamine 123 (10 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark.
The rhodamine 123-stained cells were then resuspended in
PBS and analyzed directly by flow cytometry.

Western blotting analysis

Expression levels of TAp73, DNp73, cytochrome c, caspase
9, caspase 3, and PARP were analyzed by Western blotting.

After treatment with the indicated concentrations of curcumin,
1 × 107 cells were harvested for protein extraction.
Mitochondria-free proteins were extracted according to the
manufactures’ protocols. The whole-cell lysate was extracted
with a RIPA buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, 5 M NaCl, 1 % Nonidet
P-40, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 % SDS, 1 mM
phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride). The proteins were denatured
at 96 °C for 5 min after mixing with 5 μl SDS-loading buffer,
separated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were

then blocked with TBS containing 5 % nonfat milk at 4 °C for
1 h, incubated with the specific primary antibodies (1:400
dilution for all) at 4 °C overnight, then with the corresponding
IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution for
all) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were visualized
using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and Odyssey v1.2
(LI-COR, NE, USA). The relative densities of the protein
bands were analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA). The relative expressions of target proteins were
normalized to the corresponding intensities of β-actin.

At the bottom of Fig. 3 are semi-quantitative represen-

the OTM was significantly in-

(P < 0.05); however,
there was no significant change
observed in 10 and 20 μM curcumin-treated groups
(P>0.05).

Results

Transfected efficiency of TAp73 and DNp73 expression
plasmid

The transfection efficiency in Hep3B after 24-h incubation
with TAp73 and DNp73 plasmids was evaluated by Q-PCR
and Western blotting methods. The results for Q-PCR are
shown in Fig. 1a, for Western blotting are shown in
Fig. 1b, c (TAp73 and DNp73, respectively). The mRNA
and protein levels in the transfected cells were significantly
higher than those in the control cells. Thus, we select the
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells to study p73 functions in following
assays.

Effect of curcumin on cell survival ratio

The cell viability and apoptosis ratio of different concentra-
tions (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μM) of curcumin on Hep3B and
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were assessed using the MTT reduc-
tion assay and annexin V-FITC /PI double-staining assay at
24 h post-treatment. As shown in Fig. 2a, viabilities of
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were significantly reduced by 40
and 80 μM curcumin at 24 h (P<0.01). However, there was
no significant change in the viability at 24 h for all curcumin-
treated groups in the Hep3B cells (P>0.05). The results of
flow cytometry are consistent with the cell viability assay; as
shown in Fig. 2b, high levels of apoptotic Hep3BTAp73/DNp73
cells were detected in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated
groups at 24 h, and these numbers were significantly higher
than those observed in the control groups (P<0.01) (Fig. 2c);
however, compared to the control group, there was no signif-
icant change in the apoptotic Hep3B cells at 24 h for all
curcumin-treated groups (P>0.05). The data were consistent
with the cell viability results. Based on the above results, the
24-h time point was chosen for further analyses.

Effect of curcumin on DNA damage

The extent of curcumin-induced DNA damage in
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells was determined using comet assay.

Effect of curcumin on MMP

To determine whether curcumin-induced apoptotic cell
the MMP of
death was mitochondria associated,
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells was measured using rhodamine
123 staining. As shown in Fig. 4a, increased rhodamine
123-positive Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were observed in
40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups. The quantita-
tive results are shown in Fig. 4b and indicate that the
populations of rhodamine 123-stained cells in the 40
and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups were significantly
than in the corresponding un-treated groups
higher
(P<0.01).

Effect of curcumin on protein levels of TAp73 and DNp73

To investigate whether curcumin can activate TAp73 and
DNp73, the inductions of TAp73 and DNp73 were examined
by Western blotting, and the relative density of the bands was

calculated. After treatment of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with
curcumin for 24 h, as shown in Fig. 5a, in the whole-cell
lysate, an obvious increase of TAp73 and a corresponding
decrease of DNp73 in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated
groups were observed; as shown in Fig. 5b, c, compared to the
corresponding controls, the differences were significant
(P<0.01). Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5d, the ratio of
TAp73/DNp73 in 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups
was also significantly increased (P<0.01).

Effect of curcumin on caspases and its associated protein
levels

To investigate whether the curcumin-induced apoptosis is
caspase associated,
the protein levels of caspase 3,
cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, cleaved caspase 9, PARP,
and cleaved PARP were examined by Western blotting,
and the relative density of the bands was calculated.
After treatment of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with curcumin
for 24 h, as shown in Fig. 6a, in the whole-cell lysate,
curcumin markedly increased cleaved caspase 9, caspase
3, and PARP and obviously decreased pro-caspase 9,
pro-caspase 3, and pro-PARP in the 40 and 80 μM
curcumin-treated groups (P<0.01 for all) (Fig. 6b–d).

Effect of curcumin on cytochrome c release

To investigate whether the curcumin-induced apoptosis
is mitochondria dependent,
the protein levels of cyto-
chrome c in the mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts
were examined by Western blotting, and the relative
density of the bands was calculated. After treatment of
Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with curcumin for 24 h, as
shown in Fig.7a,
extracts, curcumin markedly increased the cytochrome
c released level in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated
groups; compared to the control group, the differences
were significant (P<0.01).

Discussion

Curcumin is a turmeric polyphenol used in cancer therapy
and has been reported to induce apoptosis through the
activation of p53-dependent pathways [39, 40]. Similar
to the previous studies, we found that there is no differ-
ence of cell viability after 10–80 μM curcumin 24 h post-
treatment in p53-deficient Hep3B cells; however, 40 and

ultimately leading to mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and cell
cycle arrest [47–52]. The comet assay or single cell gel
(SCG) assay is a new method that allows efficient deter-
mination of single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand
breaks (DSB), as well as alkali-labile sites in the DNA of
single cells [53, 54]. Thus, comet assay is a sensitive
method to determine the extent of DNA damage for
recognizing precancerous cells (live cells with unrepaired
DNA damage) and to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-
cancer agents (percentage of apoptotic cells). Our data
showed that, after 24-h treatment with 40 and 80 μM
curcumin, DNA damage extent was increased in which
treatment group cell apoptosis was also induced.

p53 plays pivotal roles in connecting the DNA damage
response to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [55, 56].
p73, a p53 family member, has also been predicted to
act as a “functional link” due to its significant sequence
similarity to p53 [57]. Unlike p53, which is mutated or
inactivated in more than 50 % of human tumors, p73
mutations are rarely observed in cancers [28, 57]. Instead,
high levels of DNp73 proteins are commonly observed in
human tumors, and like p53, TAp73 is a tumor suppressor
gene that when specifically deleted in mice (TAp73-/-)
leads to enhanced tumor susceptibility [58]. TAp73 also
mediates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, while DNp73
expression leads to chemoresistance [59]. These studies
suggest a paradigm in which the balance between the
various proapoptotic TAp73 and anti-apoptotic DNp73
isoforms determines whether specific p73 isoform-
dependent signaling pathways lead to apoptosis or survival
in tumor cells in response to DNA damage. In the present
study, we found that curcumin-induced DNA damage
caused increase of TAp73 levels but decrease of DNp73
protein levels, resulting in the increase of TAp73/DNp73
ratio. These results, combined with the disruption of
MMP; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and
cleavage of pro-caspase 9, pro-caspase 3, and pro-PARP,
indicate that the increased DNA damage contributes to the
induction of mitochondria-associated apoptosis via a p73-
dependent pathway.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that curcumin-
induced DNA damage accumulation increases TAp73/
DNp73 ratio in the TAp73 and DNp73 overexpression
Hep3B cells which in turn trigger apoptosis. This
curcumin-induced apoptosis is mitochondria associated.
Further studies need to be conducted to characterize the
detailed mechanisms responsible for p73 activation as
well as subsequent events leading to mitochondria-
associated apoptosis in response to curcumin.

to induce cell death in p53-deficient Hep3B cells, but 40
and 80 μM curcumin induced apoptosis in Hep3BTAp73/
DNp73 cells after 24 h of treatment.

DNA damage can initiate genomic instability, ulti-
mately leading to cancer [41, 42]. Paradoxically, howev-
er, induction of DNA damage is also used to kill cancer
cells, and most anticancer agents act by introducing
sufficient DNA damage into the cancer cells to activate
cell apoptosis [43]. Some anticancer agents can generate
DNA damage directly such as cisplatin which can bind
to purine bases of DNA leading to mono-, inter-, and
intra-strand adducts, causing distortion of the DNA dou-
ble helix, and ultimately resulting in activation of DNA
damage response including cell cycle arrest and apopto-
sis [44–46]. However, many others generate DNA dam-
age indirectly such as curcumin which can induce ROS
generation and results in oxidative DNA damage,
