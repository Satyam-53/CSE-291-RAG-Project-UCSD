It has been shown to induce apoptosis through p53dependent pathways. p73 gene is a member of the p53 family which encodes both a tumor suppressor (transactivation-competent p73 (TAp73)) and a putative oncogene (dominantnegative p73 (DNp73)); the former shares similarity with the tumor suppressor p53, and the latter behaves as dominantnegative proteins that interfere with the activity of TAp73. To understand the p73-dependent mechanisms that are engaged during curcumin-induced apoptosis, we established a p73 overexpression cell models using p53-deficient Hep3B cells (Hep3BTAp73/DNp73). Our results demonstrated that curcumin at concentrations of 40 and 80 μM induced DNA damage, increased TAp73/DNp73 ratio, and also led to apoptosis in the Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells. The apoptotic cell death was concurrent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results demonstrated a p73-dependent mechanism for curcumin-induced apoptosis that involves the mitochondria-mediated pathway. Keywords Curcumin . TAp73 . DNp73 . DNA damage . Apoptosis J.

Curcumin has been used for centuries in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. Recent studies show that curcumin possesses potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, chemo-preventive, and chemo-therapeutic activities [1, 2]. In vitro treatment, curcumin suppresses the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells, including carcinomas of the breast, prostate, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, brain, and lung [3–7]. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that is activated by cellular stresses such as DNA damage and oncogene stimulation . Upon activation, p53 may induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis [9, 10]. Thus, p53 acts to maintain genome stability and eliminate damaged or abnormally proliferating cells. Following cellular stresses, p53 is stabilized and binds to DNA as a tetramer, in a sequence-specific manner that results in the transcriptional activation of a series of target proteins including p21, BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL-2 antagonist killer, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) [11–14]. Previous studies have also demonstrated important roles for p53 in curcumin-induced apoptosis. For instance, curcumin can induce human HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis by activating p53 and regulating apoptosis-related protein 4204 Tumor Biol. (2016) 37:4203–4212 expression [15, 16]. In another case, curcumin treatment can improve the general health of patients with colorectal cancer via the mechanism of increased p53 molecule expression in tumor cells and consequently speeds up tumor cell apoptosis . Unfortunately, loss of p53 function is the most common event during tumorigenesis in diverse types of human cancer; thus, many tumor cells lack the functional p53 [18, 19]. However, little is known about the function of curcumin in p53-mutant (or deficient) cancer cells. p73, as a p53 family member, is also responsive to the DNA damage that leads to apoptosis [20, 21]. The p73 gene encodes two isoforms that differ in their N-termini and which can be functionally classified as transactivation-competent (TAp73) and dominant-negative (DNp73) proteins [22, 23]. The TAp73 shares similarities with p53 with regard to DNA damage-induced apoptosis through its activation of p53responsive genes [24, 25]. The DNp73 has a very important regulatory role, as it exerts a dominant-negative effect on p53 and TAp73 by inhibiting their transactivation activity. Thus, DNp73 confers drug resistance to tumor cells harboring p53 and/or TAp73 . Its inhibitory function is exerted either at the oligomerization level, or by competing for binding to the p53/TAp73 DNA target sequence . In addition, the DNp73 promoter contains an efficient p53/TAp73responsive element that can be transactivated by p53 and/or TAp73, and therefore creates a dominant-negative feedback loop that regulates the function of p53 and/or TAp73 [27, 28]. Several lines of evidences indicate that the presence and participation of different spliced forms of p73 might be one reason for the different cell fates observed in response to DNA damage [29, 30]. However, it is still unknown whether TAp73 and/or DNp73 participates in curcumin-induced apoptosis. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a key initiative step in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol is fundamental to apoptosome formation and initiator caspases (such as caspase 9) and executioner caspases (such as caspase 3) activation . The activated caspase 9 and caspase 3 in turn cleave a variety of cellular substrates, most notably poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) . One of the most important functions of PARP is to help repair single-strand DNA nicks. Thus, cleaved PARP is a useful marker of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis . In this current study, we sought to analyze the p73 roles during curcumin-induced apoptosis. Using the p53-deficient and little p73 expression Hep3B cells, we first established a curcumin-induced apoptotic model. Then, we carried out a set of analyses assessing cell viability, percentages of apoptotic cells, extent of DNA damage, and mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP). Finally, we analyzed the protein levels of TAp73, DNp73, pro-caspase 9, cleaved caspase 9, procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, pro-PARP, cleaved PARP, and cytochrome c. Our results, as detailed below, suggest that there exists a p53-independent but p73-dependent apoptotic pathway in response to curcumin exposure, which is mediated through the mitochondrial pathway.

Cell culture and treatment Hep3B cells were supplied by the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). Hep3B cells were cultured in DMEM medium which contained 10 % (v/v) FBS. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Curcumin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a stock solution (final concentration: 80 mM). Establishment of TAp73- and DNp73-overexpressing Hep3B cells (Hep3BTAp73/DNp73) For transfection of the plasmid, Hep3B cells were seeded at 3×105 per well in six-well plates. Then, the adherent cells were trypsinized by 0.25 % trypsin and diluted in the DMEM. Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was diluted into Opti-MEM I medium (final concentration: 5 %) and incubated Tumor Biol.

Slides were placed in an electrophoresis unit for 40 min to allow DNA to relax in the electrophoretic solution consisting of 300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA, pH>13, at 4 °C. Then, the slides were subjected to electrophoresis (4 °C) for 20 min at electric field strength of 0.86 V/cm, 25 V, 300 mA. After electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized in 0.4 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). DNA was stained with PI at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Slides were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a UV-1 filter block at 360 nm connected to the computer-based image analysis system CASP-Comet Assay Software. One hundred images were randomly selected from each sample, and the olive tail moment (OTM) was measured. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential MMP was measured using the rhodamine 123 fluorescent dye according to the method described previously . Loss of MMP results in the release of rhodamine 123 from the at room temperature for 10 min. The plasmids were also diluted into Opti-MEM I medium (final concentration 50 nM). Diluted Lipofectamine 2000 transfection agent and diluted plasmid were combined and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The transfection mixture was added to six-well plates. Cell suspensions were overlaid onto the transfection complexes. After 6-h incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were cultured in normal medium. Q-PCR and Western blotting were performed to validate the transfected efficiency. Assessment of cell viability Cell viability was determined by the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of MTT as previously described . Both Hep3B and Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5×103 cells per well. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were treated with curcumin at concentrations of 10, 20, 40, and 80 μM. At 24 h after treatment, the supernatant was removed and 100 μl (500 μg/ml) MTT solution was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MTT solution from each well was removed. A volume of 150 μl DMSO was added, and the plates were shaken for 5 min to dissolve formazan crystals. The optical density at 570 nm for each well was determined using a microtiter plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Cell viability was represented as the absorbance of treated sample/absorbance of control group×100 %. Measurement of cell apoptosis The percentage of apoptosis for the two cell lines were analyzed by staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Both of the cells were seeded in six-well plates at 4×105 cells per well. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of curcumin, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in buffer containing 1 % (v/v) annexin V-FITC and 2 % (v/v) propidium iodide and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Analysis was performed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the characteristics of cells were analyzed by ModFit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). Assessment of DNA damage DNA damage was assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) .

At the end of the curcumin treatment, a total of 1×106 cells were harvested and incubated with rhodamine 123 (10 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. The rhodamine 123-stained cells were then resuspended in PBS and analyzed directly by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis Expression levels of TAp73, DNp73, cytochrome c, caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP were analyzed by Western blotting. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of curcumin, 1 × 107 cells were harvested for protein extraction. Mitochondria-free proteins were extracted according to the manufactures’ protocols. The whole-cell lysate was extracted with a RIPA buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, 5 M NaCl, 1 % Nonidet P-40, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 % SDS, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride). The proteins were denatured at 96 °C for 5 min after mixing with 5 μl SDS-loading buffer, separated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, USA).

Membranes were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and Odyssey v1.2 (LI-COR, NE, USA). The relative densities of the protein bands were analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The relative expressions of target proteins were normalized to the corresponding intensities of β-actin. At the top of Fig. 3 are representative immunofluoresimages corresponding to Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells. cent At the bottom of Fig. 3 are semi-quantitative representations of the comet images. We found that, compared to the control group, the OTM was significantly increased in 40 and 80μ M curcumin-treated groups (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant change observed in 10 and 20 μM curcumin-treated groups (P>0.05). Transfected efficiency of TAp73 and DNp73 expression plasmid The transfection efficiency in Hep3B after 24-h incubation with TAp73 and DNp73 plasmids was evaluated by Q-PCR and Western blotting methods. The results for Q-PCR are shown in Fig. 1a, for Western blotting are shown in Fig. 1b, c (TAp73 and DNp73, respectively). The mRNA and protein levels in the transfected cells were significantly higher than those in the control cells. Thus, we select the Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells to study p73 functions in following assays. Effect of curcumin on cell survival ratio The cell viability and apoptosis ratio of different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μM) of curcumin on Hep3B and Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were assessed using the MTT reduction assay and annexin V-FITC /PI double-staining assay at 24 h post-treatment. As shown in Fig. 2a, viabilities of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were significantly reduced by 40 and 80 μM curcumin at 24 h (P<0.01). However, there was no significant change in the viability at 24 h for all curcumintreated groups in the Hep3B cells (P>0.05). The results of flow cytometry are consistent with the cell viability assay; as shown in Fig. 2b, high levels of apoptotic Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were detected in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups at 24 h, and these numbers were significantly higher than those observed in the control groups (P<0.01) (Fig. 2c); however, compared to the control group, there was no significant change in the apoptotic Hep3B cells at 24 h for all curcumin-treated groups (P>0.05). The data were consistent with the cell viability results. Based on the above results, the 24-h time point was chosen for further analyses. Effect of curcumin on DNA damage The extent of curcumin-induced DNA damage in Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells was determined using comet assay. Effect of curcumin on MMP To determine whether curcumin-induced apoptotic cell the MMP of death was mitochondria associated, Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells was measured using rhodamine 123 staining. As shown in Fig. 4a, increased rhodamine 123-positive Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells were observed in 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups. The quantitative results are shown in Fig. 4b and indicate that the populations of rhodamine 123-stained cells in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups were significantly than in the corresponding un-treated groups higher (P<0.01). Effect of curcumin on protein levels of TAp73 and DNp73 To investigate whether curcumin can activate TAp73 and DNp73, the inductions of TAp73 and DNp73 were examined by Western blotting, and the relative density of the bands was Fig. 3 The Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cell was treated with indicated concentrations of curcumin for 24 h.

After treatment of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with curcumin for 24 h, as shown in Fig. 5a, in the whole-cell lysate, an obvious increase of TAp73 and a corresponding decrease of DNp73 in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups were observed; as shown in Fig. 5b, c, compared to the corresponding controls, the differences were significant (P<0.01). Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5d, the ratio of TAp73/DNp73 in 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups was also significantly increased (P<0.01). Effect of curcumin on caspases and its associated protein levels To investigate whether the curcumin-induced apoptosis is caspase associated, the protein levels of caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, cleaved caspase 9, PARP, and cleaved PARP were examined by Western blotting, and the relative density of the bands was calculated. After treatment of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with curcumin for 24 h, as shown in Fig. 6a, in the whole-cell lysate, curcumin markedly increased cleaved caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP and obviously decreased pro-caspase 9, pro-caspase 3, and pro-PARP in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups (P<0.01 for all) (Fig. 6b–d). Effect of curcumin on cytochrome c release To investigate whether the curcumin-induced apoptosis is mitochondria dependent, the protein levels of cytochrome c in the mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts were examined by Western blotting, and the relative density of the bands was calculated. After treatment of Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells with curcumin for 24 h, as shown in Fig.7a, extracts, curcumin markedly increased the cytochrome c released level in the 40 and 80 μM curcumin-treated groups; compared to the control group, the differences were significant (P<0.01). in the mitochondria-free cytosolic Curcumin is a turmeric polyphenol used in cancer therapy and has been reported to induce apoptosis through the activation of p53-dependent pathways [39, 40]. Similar to the previous studies, we found that there is no difference of cell viability after 10–80 μM curcumin 24 h posttreatment in p53-deficient Hep3B cells; however, 40 and Fig. 6 The Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cell was treated with indicated concentrations of curcumin for 24 h.

(2016) 37:4203–4212 ultimately leading to mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest [47–52]. The comet assay or single cell gel (SCG) assay is a new method that allows efficient determination of single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB), as well as alkali-labile sites in the DNA of single cells [53, 54]. Thus, comet assay is a sensitive method to determine the extent of DNA damage for recognizing precancerous cells (live cells with unrepaired DNA damage) and to evaluate the effectiveness of anticancer agents (percentage of apoptotic cells). Our data showed that, after 24-h treatment with 40 and 80 μM curcumin, DNA damage extent was increased in which treatment group cell apoptosis was also induced. p53 plays pivotal roles in connecting the DNA damage response to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [55, 56]. p73, a p53 family member, has also been predicted to act as a “functional link” due to its significant sequence similarity to p53 . Unlike p53, which is mutated or inactivated in more than 50 % of human tumors, p73 mutations are rarely observed in cancers [28, 57]. Instead, high levels of DNp73 proteins are commonly observed in human tumors, and like p53, TAp73 is a tumor suppressor gene that when specifically deleted in mice (TAp73-/-) leads to enhanced tumor susceptibility . TAp73 also mediates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, while DNp73 expression leads to chemoresistance . These studies suggest a paradigm in which the balance between the various proapoptotic TAp73 and anti-apoptotic DNp73 isoforms determines whether specific p73 isoformdependent signaling pathways lead to apoptosis or survival in tumor cells in response to DNA damage. In the present study, we found that curcumin-induced DNA damage caused increase of TAp73 levels but decrease of DNp73 protein levels, resulting in the increase of TAp73/DNp73 ratio. These results, combined with the disruption of MMP; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and cleavage of pro-caspase 9, pro-caspase 3, and pro-PARP, indicate that the increased DNA damage contributes to the induction of mitochondria-associated apoptosis via a p73dependent pathway. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that curcumininduced DNA damage accumulation increases TAp73/ DNp73 ratio in the TAp73 and DNp73 overexpression Hep3B cells which in turn trigger apoptosis. This curcumin-induced apoptosis is mitochondria associated. Further studies need to be conducted to characterize the detailed mechanisms responsible for p73 activation as well as subsequent events leading to mitochondriaassociated apoptosis in response to curcumin.

This result was further confirmed by flow cytometry, which demonstrated that c urcumin failed to induce cell death in p53-deficient Hep3B cells, but 40 and 80 μM curcumin induced apoptosis in Hep3BTAp73/ DNp73 cells after 24 h of treatment. DNA damage can initiate genomic instability, ultimately leading to cancer [41, 42]. Paradoxically, however, induction of DNA damage is also used to kill cancer cells, and most anticancer agents act by introducing sufficient DNA damage into the cancer cells to activate cell apoptosis . Some anticancer agents can generate DNA damage directly such as cisplatin which can bind to purine bases of DNA leading to mono-, inter-, and intra-strand adducts, causing distortion of the DNA double helix, and ultimately resulting in activation of DNA damage response including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [44–46]. However, many others generate DNA damage indirectly such as curcumin which can induce ROS generation and results in oxidative DNA damage, Tumor Biol. (2016) 37:4203–4212
