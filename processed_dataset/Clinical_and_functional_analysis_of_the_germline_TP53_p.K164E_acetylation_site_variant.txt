Abstract TP53 plays a critical role as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle progression,
DNA repair, and apoptosis. Post-translational modifications such as acetylation of specific ly-
sine residues in the DNA binding and carboxy-terminus regulatory domains modulate its tu-
mor suppressor activities. In this study, we addressed the functional consequences of the
germline TP53 p.K164E (NM_000546.5: c.490A>G) variant identified in a patient with ear-
ly-onset breast cancer and a significant family history of cancer. K164 is a conserved residue
located in the L2 loop of the p53 DNA binding domain that is post-translationally modified by
acetylation. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses demonstrated that the glutamate substitu-
tion at K164 marginally destabilizes the p53 protein structure but significantly impairs se-
quence-specific DNA binding, transactivation, and tumor cell growth inhibition. Although
p.K164E is currently considered a variant of unknown significance by different clinical genetic
testing laboratories, the clinical and laboratory-based findings presented here provide strong
evidence to reclassify TP53 p.K164E as a likely pathogenic variant.

INTRODUCTION

Clinical laboratories offer a variety of diagnostic services that include sequencing of single
genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, and transcriptomes. The complexity of genetic test-
ing goes along with the critical need to classify variants according to their pathogenicity
(Richards et al. 2015). The criteria to evaluate the pathogenicity of genetic variants include
but are not limited to the prevalence in affected individuals, segregation analysis, associated
cancer phenotypes, functional studies, allele frequency from population databases, and type
of mutation and its predicted effect, among others (Duzkale et al. 2013; Richards et al. 2015).
However, healthcare providers are often challenged by the discovery of variants that cannot
be categorized into strict and clear classifications, referred to as variants of uncertain signifi-
cance (VUSs) (Federici and Soddu 2020).

Most variants that are classified as VUSs are not clinically actionable for identifying indi-
viduals at risk or for driving treatment; however, there are cases that warrant further investi-
gation for the benefit of the patients. Here, we present a proband with early-onset breast
cancer with the germline TP53 p.K164E (NM_000546.5: c.490A>G) variant, classified as a
VUS by different clinical genetic testing laboratories, that segregates in a family with high
cancer risk. The K164 residue is reportedly an important site that is post-translationally

modified by acetylation, which plays a role in the activation of p53 as a tumor suppressor
(Gu and Roeder 1997; Tang et al. 2008). Here, we provide clinical and experimental evidence
to consider reclassification of the TP53 p.K164E as a likely pathogenic variant, which could
help inform the clinical management of carriers and their at-risk relatives.

RESULTS

Proband Clinical Presentation
The patient is a 20-yr-old female who was diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma.
Ultrasound imaging detected an 18.5 × 13.4-mm mass located in the upper outer quadrant
of her left breast with no lymph node invasion. Histopathological analysis of a biopsy sample
confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated that the tumor was negative for the estrogen re-
ceptor (EP1 clone) and progesterone receptor (PgR636 clone) but positive for c-erbB-2
(HER2; score 3+). In addition, tumor cells showed strong nuclear immunoreactivity for
p53, and ∼70% were positive for the nuclear antigen Ki-67 (Fig. 1). Immunostaining also
demonstrated that the tumor was negative for cytokeratin 5/6 (D5/16 B4 clone) and positive
for epithelial cytokeratin (AE1/AE3 clone) (data not shown), confirming the epithelial origin
for this HER2-enriched breast cancer (Goldhirsch et al. 2013). The proband received neoad-
juvant chemotherapy with four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide
600 mg/m2 followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 for 12 wk and 6 mg/kg trastuzumab every
3 wk for 1 yr. A unilateral mastectomy was performed upon completion of chemotherapy.

hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Tumor cells express high levels of p53, Ki-67, and HER2.

Genomic Analyses and Family History of Cancer
Germline DNA of the proband was analyzed using a panel of 45 cancer predisposition genes
revealing only the heterozygous TP53 p.K164E (NM_000546.5: c.490A>G) variant. The fam-
ily history of cancer includes her father (II-2), who developed prostate cancer at age 72, colon
cancer at age 82, and pancreatic cancer at age 85. The proband’s mother (II-3) is alive and
well at age 63 (Fig. 2). The proband has three half-siblings on the paternal side: a half-sister
(III-1) who is alive and well at age 63, with a son (IV-1) who developed renal cell carcinoma at
age 42; a half-brother (III-2) who died from colon cancer at age 53, whose youngest daughter
(IV-4) was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast at age 12 and died from
osteosarcoma (vertebral column) at age 31 and whose older daughter (IV-3) developed bilat-
eral breast cancer at age 29; and another half-brother (III-3) who was diagnosed (40 yr old)
with and later died (age 42) from glioblastoma. None of the half-siblings underwent genetic
screening for cancer predisposition genes. However, the half-brother (III-3) had three chil-
dren, two of whom died from cancer: a daughter diagnosed with osteosarcoma at age 10
(IV-6) and a younger daughter diagnosed with chondrosarcoma of soft tissue (right iliac) at
age 29 (IV-7) who was positive for the TP53 p.K164E variant both in the germline and tumor.
Subsequently, his son (IV-5), who is currently healthy at age 35, was also found to harbor the
TP53 p.K164E variant based on a panel of 94 cancer predisposition genes. Although the pro-
band (Fig. 2, III-5) does not clearly meet classical LFS criteria per se, the diagnosis of
classic LFS for the family was established in the daughter of the proband paternal half-broth-
er (Fig. 2, IV-7).

TP53 p.K164E variant molecular analysis

TP53 p.K164E Variant Interpretation
The TP53 p.K164E germline variant was recently reported in a Chinese breast cancer study in
a woman with early-onset breast carcinoma (24 yr old), negative for BRCA mutations and a
significant family history of cancer (Kwong et al. 2020). Although TP53 p.K164E has not
been previously reported in public databases as a germline mutation, it has been listed as
a somatic variant in the COSMIC database (n = 32; variant ID: COSV52728094), The TP53
Database (n = 25), cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (n = 4), and Cancer Hotspots (n = 9) in as-
sociation with multiple tumor types including biliary tract, central nervous system, breast,
ovarian, liver, lung, head and neck, and leukemia. The TP53 p.K164E variant is not found
in the Flossies and Global Biobank Engine databases; however, it was documented in a sin-
gle male individual in the recently released gnomAD (v4.0.0) with an allele frequency of
0.000001590.

TP53 p.K164E (c.490A>G; rs879254249) (Fig. 3A) is currently classified as a VUS by
ClinVar (n = 4; variation ID: 246416). However, multiple software tools (PolyPhen-2 = damag-
ing; SIFT = damaging; Align GVGD = C55; and CADD = 23.6) predict that the p.K164E vari-
ant is nonfunctional and potentially pathogenic. Furthermore, the phenotypic annotation of

TP53 mutations (PHANTM) classifier (https://mutantp53.broadinstitute.org/) calculated a
combined phenotype score of 0.904 ± 0.286 with a low level of transcriptional activity in
yeast (14.5%), which is quite similar to the LFS-associated DNA binding mutant TP53
p.R175H [combined phenotype score of 1.025 ± 0.388; 10.11% wild-type (WT) transcription]
(Fig. 3B).

TP53 p.K164 Acetylation Site Variants
K164 is acetylated by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, and this post-translational
modification is thought to be involved in the activation of wild-type p53 (p53WT) in response
to DNA damage (Tang et al. 2008). Naturally occurring germline variants at TP53 codon 164
are rare, with only three related cases harboring the c.491_494del alteration reported in The
TP53 Database. To further understand the functional consequence of the p.K164E variant
and acetylation at this site, we compared the biochemical properties of p.K164E to (1)
p.K164R (c.491A>G), which retains the positive charge, and (2) p.K164Q (c.490A>C), which
serves as a mimetic for acetylation (Table 1; Li et al. 2002).

The TP53 p.K164R (c.491A>G) variant was not observed in the Flossies and Global
Biobank Engine databases but was observed in two individuals in the updated
gnomAD v.4.0.0, with an allele frequency of 0.00002192. This variant is not annotated
in ClinVar but was reported as a somatic mutation in The TP53 Database (n = 2), as well
as the cBioPortal (n = 1) and COSMIC (n = 1; variant ID 45428) databases. Furthermore,
the TP53 p.K164Q (c.490A>C) variant was also not found in the general population or
listed in ClinVar but was included as a somatic variant in The TP53 Database (n = 5)
and Cosmic database (variant ID 44521; n = 2) in association with diverse tumor types in-
cluding breast, lung, soft tissue, and testis. The PHANTM classifier predicts that the TP53
p.K164R and p.K164Q variants retain substantial WT activity (Fig. 3B).

TP53 p.K164E variant molecular analysis

Predicted Stability of the TP53 K164 Variants
K164 residue lies within the L2 loop on the solvent-exposed surface of the DNA
binding domain of p53 and does not directly contact DNA based on available structural
data (PDB 1 TUP; Supplemental Fig. 1). Analysis by FoldX (Schymkowitz et al. 2005) shows
that each of the K164 variants [glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), and arginine (R)] is predicted
to modestly destabilize the p53 DNA binding domain by 1.3, 2.3, and 0.7 kcal/mol,
respectively.

TP53 p.K164E Is Defective in Sequence-Specific DNA Binding
Sequence-specific DNA binding was investigated using nuclear extracts prepared from
Saos-2 cells transiently transfected with the CMV-only (negative control) vector and corre-
sponding expression vectors for p53WT, p.R175H, and each of the K164 variants (K164E,
K164R, and K164Q). Gel shifts were carried out using biotin-labeled probes corresponding
to WT and mutant (MT) p53 DNA binding consensus sites in the human p21CIP1 promoter
(see Methods). p53WT specifically bound the WT DNA probe (lane 5), but not the MT probe
(lane 8) upon the addition of PAb421, as shown in Figure 4A (Gu and Roeder 1997). Similarly,

Figure 4. The p.K164E variant is defective in sequence-specific DNA binding. p53WT and K164 variant pro-
teins were prepared from transiently transfected Saos-2 cells and analyzed for DNA sequence-specific binding
by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described in the Methods. (A) WT protein selectively bound
the p53WT DNA consensus site probe and was super-shifted by the p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421 (lane 5)
but not the mutant p53 consensus site (lane 8). (B) K164E and R175H failed to bind the p53WT consensus site
probe (lanes 10 and 20, respectively), whereas K164R (lane 14) and K164Q (lane 17) were competent for bind-
ing. (C ) Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts used in B demonstrates the level of expression of exogenous
p53 and endogenous p21. Lamin A/C and Cleaved PARP serve as nuclear markers. A–C are representative of
two independent experiments that have analyzed pools of four independently transfected cell cultures for
each variant. (MT) Mutant, (WT) wild-type, (Ab) antibody.

TP53 p.K164E variant molecular analysis

p.K164R and p.K164Q also bound the WT probe in the presence of PAb421 (Fig. 4B, lanes
14 and 17, respectively). Although p.K164E and p.R175H were well-expressed (Fig. 4C),
both proteins were defective in binding the WT DNA probe (Fig. 4B; lanes 10 and 20,
respectively).

Collectively, these clinical, structural, and functional studies reveal that the TP53 p.K164E
variant is tightly linked with tumor formation and is significantly compromised in transactiva-
tion, target gene expression, and growth suppression. These findings provide strong evi-
dence supporting the deleterious nature of the TP53 p.K164E variant.

Functional Analysis of K164 Variants
When ectopically expressed in p53-null Saos-2, TP53 p.K164E failed to activate the expres-
sion of a promoter–luciferase reporter under the control of p53-responsive elements (Fig.
5A) or its endogenous target genes p21CIP1 and MDM2 (Fig. 5B). Indeed, TP53 p.K164E
was as defective in transactivation as p.R175H, a common hotspot TP53 mutant that is struc-
turally misfolded (Bullock et al. 1997), functionally inactive (Kato et al. 2003), and highly as-
sociated with LFS core cancers (Fig. 5A,B; Olivier et al. 2010). Consistent with these results,
TP53 p.K164E and p.R175H were defective in suppressing the growth of Saos-2 cells in col-
ony reduction assays (Fig. 5C,D). In contrast, p53WT and the p.K164R and p.K164Q variants
were functional in transactivation (promoter–reporter; endogenous p21CIP1 and MDM2) and
colony growth suppression (Fig. 5A–D).

DISCUSSION

Here, we report the identification of a rare germline TP53 p.K164E mutation in a young wom-
an who developed invasive breast carcinoma and was negative for other cancer predisposi-
tion genes. The TP53 p.K164E variant segregated in a family with a cancer history consistent
with the clinical criteria for classic Li–Fraumeni syndrome (Malkin 2011). Functional studies
demonstrated that p.K164E is significantly compromised in binding DNA in a sequence-spe-
cific manner, transactivating responsive promoter–reporter and endogenous target genes
and suppressing the growth of tumor cells in colony reduction assays.

Approximately 70%–80% of families meeting classic LFS criteria are associated with
pathogenic TP53 variants (Strong 2003; Gonzalez et al. 2008). However, the concept of
LFS is evolving because of the diversity of clinical presentation and associated germline
TP53 alterations that have varied impacts on p53 structure and function. Therefore, familial
history of cancer should not be mandatory when considering TP53 genetic testing (Frebourg
et al. 2020).

p53 function is regulated by a multitude of covalent modifications, including phosphor-
ylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, among others (Bode and Dong 2004).
Various acetyltransferases have been identified that modify p53 at lysines predominantly in
the carboxyl terminus and central DNA binding domain (Sakaguchi et al. 1998). The acety-
lation of p53 is proposed to directly affect its transcriptional activity by opening its normally
closed conformation, thereby enhancing its binding to specific response elements in target
genes (Sakaguchi et al. 1998). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that K164 within the
DNA binding domain is acetylated by CBP/p300, which positively contributes to its stability
and function in regulating cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (Tang et al. 2008).

Substituting glutamate for K164 significantly compromised DNA binding, transcrip-
tional regulation, and growth suppression roughly to the same degree as the TP53 p.
R175H DNA binding mutant often associated with LFS (Olivier et al. 2010). In contrast,
the p.K164R substitution, which preserves the positive charge at this site but is unable
to be acetylated, retained p53 activity, consistent with previous studies (Tang et al.

2008). We also demonstrated that the substitution of K164 with glutamine (p.K164Q),
which mimics lysine acetylation, resulted in enhanced p53 transactivation of promoter–re-
porters and endogenous target genes, supporting the model that acetylation contributes
to the activation of p53. Although the effects of the p.K164E, p.K164R, and p.K164Q var-
iants on p53 stability were all predicted to be rather mild, substituting the negatively
charged acidic amino acid (E) at this single site renders the p.K164E variant nonfunctional.
The exact mechanism by which the glutamate substitution inactivates p53 remains to be
determined.

TP53 p.K164E variant molecular analysis

The germline TP53 p.K164E variant reported here was identified in a Brazilian proband
with early-onset HER2+ breast carcinoma, a molecular tumor subtype rare in BRCA1/BRCA2
variant carriers (Tutt et al. 2021; Tomasello et al. 2022) but often associated with pathogenic
germline TP53 variants (Wilson et al. 2010; Silwal-Pandit et al. 2014; Fortuno et al. 2020;
Evans et al. 2022). TP53 p.K164E segregated with additional family members who devel-
oped sarcoma and brain cancer at young ages. A germline TP53 p.K164E variant was also
independently identified in a young woman with early-onset breast carcinoma with a rich
family history of cancer from Southeast Asia (Kwong et al. 2020). Guidelines for classifying
the pathogenicity of TP53 variants are based on recommendations by the Clinical
Genome Resource TP53 Variant Curation Expert Panel (ClinGen TP53 VCEP)
(Fortuno
et al. 2021). By applying current guidelines (version 1.4.0, released on July 5, 2023) the
TP53 p.K164E variant meets the following codes: PM2_Supporting, PP1, PP3, PS3, and
PS4_Moderate, resulting in the classification of Likely Pathogenic. Collectively, these exper-
imental, demographic, and clinical findings support the reclassification of the TP53 p.K164E
variant from VUS to Likely Pathogenic.

METHODS

Ethics Approval
Written informed consent from patients and institutional review board approval, allowing ge-
netic analysis of germline samples, were obtained by the primary physician in Brazil. Studies
conducted at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital did not involve human subject research.

Panel Genetic Testing
Genetic testing was conducted at Fleury Medicina e Saúde, São Paulo, Brazil. Genomic DNA
from buccal swabs was enriched for targeted regions contained in the Panel Hereditary
Cancer Fast Track using a hybridization-based protocol and sequenced using Illumina tech-
nology. The panel contains 45 cancer predisposition genes [APC (including promotor), ATM,
BARD1, BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, EGFR, EPCAM,
HRAS, KIT, MEN1, MET, MLH1 (including promotor), MRE11 (MRE11A), MSH2, MSH6,
MUTYH, NBN, NF1, NF2, NTHL1, PALB2, PIK3CA, PMS1, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, PTEN (in-
cluding promotor), RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, RB1, RECQL4, RET, SMAD4, SMARCA4,
STK11, TP53 (including promotor), WT1, and XRCC2]. The variants were interpreted consid-
ering the patient’s clinical condition and the classification protocol of variants from the
American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), with PM2, PP2, and PP3 criteria for the
TP53 p.K164E variant.

Database Query: Population Database and Reported Variants
TP53 p.K164E, p.K164R, and p.K164Q variants were interrogated in public genome sequence
databases, including gnomAD (v4.0.0; >800,000 unrelated individuals as part of disease-spe-
cific and population genetic studies; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), Flossies (7000
European American and 3000 African American women older than age 70 who never had can-
cer; https://whi.color.com/about), and Global BioBank Engine (750,000 individuals including
UK Biobank, Million Veterans Program and Biobank Japan; https://biobankengine.stanford
.edu). In addition, the frequency of tumors harboring germline or somatic variants at these co-
dons was determined based on those reported in The TP53 Database (https://tp53.isb-cgc
.org) and COSMIC (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal
.org/), and Cancer Hotspots (https://www.cancerhotspots.org/) databases.

Structural Effects of Missense Variants at TP53 p.K164E
Structural effects of three amino acid substitutions at K164 [glutamic acid (Glu, E), arginine
(Arg, R), and glutamine (Gln, Q)] within the DNA binding domain of the TP53 (Wang et al.
2007) were predicted using FoldX (Schymkowitz et al. 2005) and visualized by PyMOL
(https://pymol.org/2/).

Cell Lines
The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 (TP53-null) was maintained as monolayers in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with D-glucose (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplement-
ed with 10% fetal bovine serum, MEM nonessential amino acids solution (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 2.5 mmol/L-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomycin (complete media) at 37°C un-
der 5% CO2. Saos-2 cells were authenticated by STR profiling (Promega) (Supplemental
Table 1) and demonstrated to be mycoplasma-free using the Venor GeM mycoplasma
detection kit, PCR-based (Sigma).

Expression Constructs
The p.K164E, p.K164R, and p.K164Q mutants were constructed using QuikChange II site-di-
rected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the forward primer 5′-GCCATGGCCATCTACGA
GCAGTCACAGCACA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGTGCTGTGACTGCTCGTAGATGGCC
ATGGC-3′ for the p.K164E variant, forward primer 5′-GCGCCATGGCCATCTACAGGCAG
TCACAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGTGACTGCCTGTAGATGGCCATGGCGC-3′ for the
p.K164R variant, and forward primer 5′-GCCATGGCCATCTACCAGCAGTCACAGCACA-3′
and reverse primer 5′-TGTGCTGTGACTGCTGGTAGATGGCCATGGC-3′ for the p.K164Q
variant. The pCMV-Neo-Bam expression vector containing wild-type TP53 cDNA (arginine
at codon 72) served as the template. These plasmids were provided by B. Vogelstein, Johns
Hopkins Oncology Center. The entire coding sequence of each plasmid was confirmed by di-
rect DNA sequencing.

Saos-2 cells were transiently cotransfected with 100 ng of the p53-responsive luciferase re-
porter PG13-Luc (Addgene) that contains 13 copies of the p53 DNA binding consensus site
upstream of the polyoma promoter and 5.5 µg of pCMV-Neo-Bam (vector only) or 5.5 µg of
pCMV-Neo-Bam expressing WT p53, p.R175H, p.K164E, p.K164R, or p.K164Q using
Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously described (Pinto et al. 2020,
2022). Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection and lysed in passive lysis buffer
(Promega) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein yield was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The relative luciferase activity was determined using the single luciferase assay
system (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s directions by adding 20 µL of protein lysate to
100 µL of luciferase assay reagent (Promega), followed by a 2-sec measurement delay and
then 10-sec measurement read in an Optocomp I
luminometer (MGM Instruments).
Relative light units (RLUs) were normalized to total protein (Pinto et al. 2020, 2022).

In parallel, total protein extracts (13 µg) were separated on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris
gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as previously re-
ported (Pinto et al. 2020, 2022). Membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-
human p53 DO-1 antibody (1:500; EMD Millipore), rabbit p21 Waf1/Cip1 (1:1000; Cell
Signaling), mouse anti-mdm2 antibody (1:2500; Abcam), and mouse monoclonal β-Actin an-
tibody (1:4000; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by corresponding secondary antibodies. Proteins
were detected using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner.

TP53 p.K164E variant molecular analysis

Colony Reduction
Cells were transfected with p53 expression vectors using Lipofectamine and selected in a
complete medium containing 800 µg/mL G418 antibiotic (Invitrogen) for up to 21 d with
the change of media every 3 d. Cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered sa-
line (D-PBS), fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 1:20 Giemsa (diluted in D-PBS) stain for
45 min, washed briefly, and air-dried before visualization and image capture (Epson perfec-
tion V600).

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
Biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the p53-responsive elements in the p21 pro-
moter were prepared as previously described (Kendig et al. 2017). The oligonucleotides (5′-
CATCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGGGCGTCGGCTGTCGGAGGAACATGTCCCAAC-
ATGTTGAGCTCT-3′) containing two repeats of the p53 consensus sequence (underlined) in
the human p21CIP1 promoter and its antisense strand DNA were synthesized and labeled
with Biotin 3′ end DNA labeling kit (WT probe) (Thermo Scientific). To determine binding
specificity, probes with a mutant binding site (5′-CATCAGGAAAATTTCCCAAAAT
TTTGGGCGTCGGCTGTCGGAGGAAAATTTCCCAAAATTTTGAGCTCT-3′) were included
as a negative control (MT probe), and unlabeled WT binding site oligonucleotides were
used in competition assays.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from Saos-2 cells transiently transfected with p53WT and
expression constructs (K164E, K164R, K164Q, and R175H) using NE-PER nuclear and cyto-
plasmic extraction reagents (Thermo Fisher). Lamin A/C (1:2000, Cell Signaling) and Cleaved
PARP (1:1000; Cell Signaling) were analyzed by Western blot as nuclear marker loading con-
trols. Nuclear extracts (2 µL of NE-PER reagent extract = 1.7 µg/µL) were incubated in 1×
binding buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT at pH 7.5), 2.5% glycerol, 5 mM
MgCl2, 50 ng/µL Poly (dI.dC), 0.05% NP-40, 4 pmol of unlabeled DNA, and 20 fmol of bio-
tin-labeled probes (WT and MT) in a total volume of 20 µL. Super-shift reactions were per-
formed using nuclear extracts, biotin-labeled DNA probe, and anti-p53 monoclonal
antibody PAb421 (OP03, Calbiochem). Competition experiments were carried out by add-
ing 200× unlabeled DNA to the supershift assay. The protein–DNA complex was separated
from unbound probe using a precast DNA retardation gel (6%; Thermo Fisher) for 2 h at 4°C
in a 0.5× TBE running buffer. The gel was then transferred to a positively charged Biodyne B
nylon membrane (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were cross-linked, blocked in 16 mL of block-
ing buffer (Thermo Fisher), incubated in a solution containing 1:300 dilution of stabilized
Streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and visualized using a chemiluminescent
nucleic acid detection module (Thermo Fisher).
