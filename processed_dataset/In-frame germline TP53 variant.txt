Germline loss-of-function variants in TP53 cause Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) characterized by an early 
onset of various cancer types including sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinoma, and breast cancer. The 
most common are mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53, but alterations in the oligomerization 
domain also cause LFS with variable level of penetrance. Here we report identification of a novel 
germline in-frame deletion TP53 variant c.1015_1023del p.(E339_F341del) in a family with early-onset 
breast cancer and other malignancies. Using functional testing, we found that a short deletion in the 
oligomerization domain in the p.E339_F341del variant severely impaired transcriptional activity of 
p53 in human cells and in a yeast model. The loss of the transactivation activity was consistent with 
an observed defect in formation of p53 tetramers. Finally, we found that cells expressing the p.E339_
F341del variant were insensitive to inhibition of MDM2 by nutlin-3 confirming the functional defect. We 
conclude that the in-frame germline c.1015_1023del TP53 variant encodes a transcriptionally inactive 
protein and promotes LFS with a high penetrant cancer phenotype.

Tumor suppressor p53 acts as a transcription factor that triggers expression of various target genes involved in 
cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. At basal conditions, level of p53 is low due to the constant ubiquitination 
by  MDM2  and  degradation  by  proteasome1,2.  In  response  to  various  stress  stimuli  (including  DNA  damage, 
replication  stress  or  oncogene  activation),  p53  is  stabilized,  forms  a  tetramer  through  its  C-terminal 
oligomerization domain (OD; residues 325–356) and binds to the promoters of the target genes through its DNA 
binding domain (DBD; residues 102–292). Somatic mutations affecting the DBD are frequent in human tumors 
and typically associate with poor prognosis. In addition, germline TP53 mutations cause Li–Fraumeni syndrome 
(LFS), a rare genetic disorder linked with early onset tumorigenesis including sarcomas, adrenocortical, breast 
and other cancer types3. Loss of function mutations are most common within the DBD and are less frequent in 
the OD4,5. Nevertheless, the oligomerization status of p53 has recently been linked with the level of penetrance 
in LFS families6. In addition, some of the mutants in the OD (in particular p.A347D) showed gain-of-function 
phenotypes that were unrelated to the transactivation activity7,8.

Attempts  to  identify  the  mechanism  of  tumorigenesis  caused  by  the  loss  of  p53  have  failed  to  identify  a 
single pathway whose defect could explain the cellular transformation in various tumor types, suggesting that 
the spectrum of the relevant p53-dependent transcriptional targets is large and may differ across tissues and 
cellular contexts9,10. The best understood function of p53 includes its ability to arrest the cell cycle progression 
by transcriptional activation of CDKN1A gene leading to production of the p21 protein, an efficient inhibitor 
of  cyclin-dependent  kinases11,12.  Upon  extensive  genotoxic  stress,  p53  can  promote  apoptosis  by  various 
mechanisms including transcription of PUMA, NOXA, and other targets13,14. On the other hand, the genotoxic

stress does not always lead to cell death as p53 also triggers expression of its negative regulator MDM2 thus 
limiting the extent of the pathway activation15.

During routine germline genetic testing, we identified a novel germline in-frame deletion c.1015_1023del; 
p.(E339_F341del) in the OD of p53 in a breast cancer patient with a positive family cancer history. To explore the 
pathogenicity of the variant, we performed a functional analysis of the p53-p.E339_F341del protein expressed 
in  human  RPE-TP53-KO  cells  and  using  the  functional  analysis  of  separated  alleles  in  yeast  (FASAY)16.  We 
found  that  the  variant  isoform  failed  to  induce  expression  of  p21  and  MDM2  in  human  cells  and  produced 
a  functionally  impaired  protein  in  yeast  model.  In  addition,  we  found  that  the  p.E339_F341del  isoform  did 
not  form  tetramers.  We  conclude  that  TP53  c.1015_1023del  variant  is  a  transcriptionally  inactive  germline 
pathogenic variant, which is responsible for a high cancer risk in the affected family.

Results
Identification of TP53 c.1015_1023del variant and clinical characteristics of the carrier
The healthy proband (born 1989) was initially tested in 2016 for the presence of germline pathogenic variants 
in  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  because  of  her  positive  family  history.  Her  father  died  of  pancreatic  or  hepatobiliary 
cancer at age 48, her uncle died of a brain tumor of uncertain histology at age 11 and her aunt was treated at 
age 55 for thyroid cancer (Fig. 1A). The father’s mother and her sister died of breast cancer at age 35 and 36, 
respectively. The initial BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing was negative. She was enrolled in breast cancer screening 
by yearly ultrasound. At the age of 33 years, the proband developed a discharge from her left breast and was 
diagnosed with synchronous breast cancer bilaterally. Ultrasonography identified a breast tumor (12 × 7 mm) 
with  calcifications.  Biopsy  and  histopathological  examination  showed  an  estrogen  receptor  (ER)-positive 
(90%), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive (90%), HER2 receptor-negative (0%), and Ki67-positive (45%) G3 
ductal  carcinoma  in  situ  (DCIS).  MRI  revealed  another  nodular  lesion  with  microcalcifications  in  the  same 
breast and a similar lesion in the contralateral breast examined as multicentric breast cancer cT2/N0/M0. The 
patient underwent total bilateral mastectomy (without breast reconstruction) followed by a standard adjuvant 
treatment  (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide)  and  maintenance  therapy  with  paclitaxel  and  is  currently  in  her 
first  complete  remission.  Due  to  the  positive  family  cancer  history,  young  age  at  the  time  of  breast  cancer 
diagnosis, and presence of bilateral tumor, we indicated an extension of the germline genetic testing by NGS 
using  the  CZECANCA  panel  targeting  226  risk  genes17.  The  analysis  revealed  a  previously  undescribed  in-
frame heterozygous deletion in the TP53 gene (NM_000546.6): c.1015_1023del, p.(Glu339_Phe341del; further 
referred to as E339_F341del; Fig. 1B) located in exon 10 coding for the conserved tetramerization domain of the 
p53 protein. Cascade germline genetic testing revealed that her son carries the same TP53 heterozygous variant, 
whereas her daughter and the healthy mother carries the wild type TP53.

cancer; C34 lung cancer; C50 breast cancer; C24 biliary cancer; C25 pancreatic cancer; C71 brain tumor; C73

coding sequence of exon 10 (upper panel compared to the wild-type TP53 sequence in the lower panel). The 
wild-type: altered allele ratio was 54:51, taking into account altered reads with a deletion (N = 41; indicated by 
black X) and incorrectly mapped reads with the deletion at their ends (N = 10; indicated by red X).

Functional analysis of the TP53 c.1015_1023del variant
To perform a functional analysis of a newly identified TP53 variant, we developed an experimental model of 
human non-transformed RPE1-TERT cells with frameshifting mutations in exon 4 of the TP53 locus introduced 
using  CRISPR/Cas9  technology  (Fig.  2A).  Using  parental  RPE1-TERT  cells  as  controls,  we  confirmed  the 
absence of p53 in RPE-TP53-KO cells by immunoblotting and by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B,C). 
As expected, we also found that RPE-TP53-KO cells failed to induce expression of p21 (transcribed from the 
CDKN1A  gene)  after  treatment  with  the  MDM2  inhibitor  nutlin-3  (Fig.  2B,C)  or  after  exposure  to  ionizing 
radiation  (data  not  shown).  Next,  we  stably  transfected  RPE-TP53-KO  cells  with  pCW57-RFP-P2A-TP53 
plasmid allowing for doxycycline-inducible expression of the wild-type p53 (Fig. 2D). In parallel, we developed 
stable  cell  lines  inducibly  expressing  the  cancer-derived  hot  spot  TP53-R248W  mutant  in  the  DNA-binding 
domain or the tested TP53-E339_F341del variant (Fig. 2D). Upon induction of the polyclonal cell lines with 
doxycycline, we observed a variable level of p53 expression in individual cells (data not shown) and therefore 
we used a high-content microscopy that allows gating for cells with comparable levels of p53 and we quantified 
the level of p21 expression. Importantly, we observed that induction of the wild-type p53 in RPE-TP53-KO cells 
stimulated comparable expression of p21 to that in the parental RPE cells treated with nutlin-3 (Fig. 2E). As 
expected, we found that the TP53-R248W mutant failed to promote expression of p21 (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, 
cells  expressing  the  TP53-E339_F341del  mutant  also  did  not  express  p21  suggesting  that  this  variant  fails 
to  transactivate  the  target  genes  of  p53  (Fig.  2E).  To  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  observed  phenotype  is 
specific for promoter of the CDKN1A gene, we repeated the analysis and quantified levels of MDM2 which is 
another  transcriptional  target  of  p5318.  Indeed,  we  observed  that  the  wild-type  p53  stimulated  expression  of 
MDM2,  whereas  the  TP53-R248W  mutant  failed  to  do  so  (Fig.  2F).  Similarly,  we  found  that  the  p53-E339_
F341del mutant also did not stimulate expression of MDM2 thus fully confirming its impaired transcriptional 
activity (Fig. 2F). Finally, we tested the proband’s blood sample using an established FASAY assay in yeast. We 
observed 54.7% of red colonies representing the transcriptionally inactive p53 allele and 45.3% of white colonies 
representing the functional allele, which is consistent with an inactive TP53 variant present in the heterozygous 
state (Fig. 2G, Supplementary Fig. 1). Subsequent DNA sequencing of the red colonies confirmed the presence 
of the TP53-E339_F341del variant. Overall, the yeast assay fully confirmed the conclusion from the human cells 
that TP53-E339_F341del variant is transcriptionally inactive.

Impaired tetramerization of the p53-E339_F341del protein
Mutations within OD with variable impact on p53 oligomerization have previously been reported in LFS20,21. In 
addition, the founder variant R337H that is linked with pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma in southern Brazil, 
has also been shown to exhibit decreased stability of the tetramer22. As the in-frame deletion p53-E339_F341del 
affects the alpha helix in the OD, we aimed to test its oligomerization properties. We treated cell extracts with 
0.05% glutaraldehyde to cross-link the protein complexes and as expected, we observed that the wild type p53 
formed dimers and tetramers (Fig. 3A). Similarly, another p53 variant E339G was able to form oligomers albeit 
with a slightly reduced efficiency compared to the wild-type p53 and this corresponded well to its preserved 
transcriptional activity (Fig. 3A, data not shown). In contrast, only the monomer was observed in E339_F341del 
mutant suggesting that its ability to form dimers and tetramers was strongly impaired (Fig. 3A).

Finally, we tested the impact of E339_F341del variant on cellular proliferation. As expected, we found that 
parental RPE cells failed to form colonies when cultivated in the presence of nutlin-3 whereas the RPE-TP53-KO 
cells were insensitive to inhibition of MDM2 (Fig. 3B). Expression of the wild type p53 efficiently suppressed 
proliferation of RPE cells in the presence of nutlin-3. In contrast, the expression of the E339_F341del mutant 
did not significantly affect the proliferation of cells thus confirming the loss-of-function phenotype (Fig. 3B).

Overall, we conclude that the impaired transcriptional activity of the newly identified the p53-E339_F341del 
variant is caused by its failure to form stable oligomers. Our complex functional analysis showed loss of function 
of  the  p53-E339_F341del  variant  in  both  the  RPE  human  cells  and  in  a  yeast  model.  Applying  our  results 
within the strict framework of the ACMG/AMP Variant Interpretation Guidelines for TP53 (v2.3.0) supports 
classification of the variant as a VUS, based on the following codes: PS3 (4 points), PS4 (0.5 point), PM2 (1 
point)23. As GVGD and BayesDel tools are not suitable for in-frame deletions, we analyzed the c.1015_1023del 
TP53  variant  by  alternative  prediction  algorithms  that  all  supported  a  damaging  effect,  including  MutPred-
Indel (score: 0.82806; likely deleterious, high confidence), MutationTaster (deleterious), FATHMM-indel (score: 
0.9392; pathogenic), and PROVEAN (score: − 16.22; deleterious). The concordant outcome of the predictions 
justified application of the additional PP3 criterion (1 point) and conclusion that the c.1015_1023del variant 
could be considered likely pathogenic. The variant classification is consistent with the clinical data suggesting 
association of the TP53-E339_F341del variant with the development of early onset tumors typical for LFS.

Discussion
The introduction of NGS into clinical genetic testing for germline cancer predisposition has rapidly increased 
both the number of patients analyzed and the number of germline variants identified. For several reasons, the 
female breast cancer patients are analyzed the most frequently. Breast cancer is the most common in female 
cancer patients worldwide, the population frequencies of pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition 
genes belongs to the highest among the high-penetrant cancer predisposition genes overall (especially in BRCA2 
and BRCA1), the risk of cancer in carriers of pathogenic variants is well described and the guidelines for their 
cancer prevention and treatment are available in the clinical practice worldwide24–26. The TP53 gene belongs to 
routinely tested breast cancer predisposition genes, regardless of the rarity of its germline variants, which are two 
orders of magnitude less frequent than those in BRCA2 (0.06% vs. 1.29% and 0.014% vs. 1.54%, respectively), as 
demonstrated in the largest breast cancer studies by Hu et al. and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium27,28. 
The evidence that breast cancer, and in particular its early-onset form, is the most common type of tumor in

female patients with LFS provides a rationale for the germline analysis of TP53. Breast cancer was observed in 
79% of female LFS patients in a French population with median age at disease onset at 33 years29. The German 
LFS Registry study found breast cancer in over 35% of LFS cancer patients (15% at the age of ≤ 30 years and 
20% at age > 30 years) and in > 50% of all cancers in patients with attenuated LFS30. The indication for germline 
genetic testing of TP53 is recommended in all women diagnosed with breast cancer up to 31 years of age. The 
carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants were found in 6% of such patients in aforementioned French study and 
similar frequencies (3.8–7.7%) were reported by Fortuno et al. who reviewed 59 breast cancer studies analyzing 
the  germline  TP53  variants  in  female  patients  diagnosed  at  age < 30  years29,31.  Importantly,  about  half  of  the

TP53 carriers did not meet the NCCN criteria for LFS just like our proband developing HER2-negative (different 
from pathognomonic HER2-positive tumors in early-onset LFS patients) at the age of 33 years32. Interestingly, 
a reduced proportion of HER2-positive tumors has been found also in patients carrying the p.R337H variant, 
Brazilian founder variant and the most frequent pathogenic alteration affecting the OD in p53.

The  clinical  significance  of  LFS  patients  and  a  high  frequency  of  somatic  TP53  variants  have  stimulated 
functional studies aimed at classifying TP53 variants33. The largest analyses have implemented saturation editing 
approaches, which allow comprehensive analyzes of variants across the entire coding sequence34,35. However, 
these approaches, recommended for the application of the PS3 criterion for ACMG/AMP TP53-specific variant 
interpretation guidelines do not consider in-frame variants including c.1015_1023del found in our proband23. 
Since there were no functional data available for the variant,  we have  tested the pathogenicity of the variant 
using functional assays in human cells and in yeast. In agreement with the reported correlation between the 
oligomerization status and the clinical outcome of LFS6, we observed a high penetrance of various types of cancer 
in the family carrying the germline TP53 c.1015_1023del variant that results in production of oligomerization-
deficient E339_F341del protein. Our functional analysis in human RPE cells revealed that E339_F341del fails 
to  stimulate  the  expression  of  two  independent  p53  targets  suggesting  that  its  pathogenic  behavior  is  likely 
caused by transactivation defect in transcription. In contrast, we tested the p.E339G missense variant that was 
able to form oligomers and showed no defects in transcription of p21 and MDM2, which is in good agreement 
with a previous description of the p.E339G variant as benign36. The pathogenic nature of the p.E339_F341del 
variant was further supported by the FASAY showing impaired transactivation of the p53 promoter in a yeast 
experimental  system.  Our  results  are  consistent  with  previously  published  data  by  Kawaguchi  et  al.,  who 
conducted a systematic mutational analysis of individual amino acids in the OD37. The authors demonstrated 
that  substitutions  at  F340  and  F341,  but  no  at  E339  (all  comprising  part  of  the  α-helix  critical  for  tetramer 
formation)  impaired  oligomerization  and  severely  reduced  transcriptional  activity.  Loss  of  the  tetrameric 
structure is directly linked to the loss of p53 function, and deletions encompassing this segment may have an 
even greater destabilizing effect than individual missense variants.

Although  our  functional  analyses  showed  that  the  c.1015_1023del  variant  encodes  functionally  impaired 
p53 protein with in frame deletion of tree amino acids in the OD, the lack of samples from deceased relatives of 
the proband hindered the segregation analysis. We found no other carrier of this variant in the analysis of over 
50,000 Czech probands tested by panel NGS suggesting that the variant is probably rare. On the other hand, it 
has been reported in the COSMIC database (COSM23457149) and also as a somatic variant in a non-small cell 
lung cancer tumor sample with LOH in the second allele38.

In  conclusion,  we  provide  evidence  that  the  in-frame  germline  c.1015_1023del  TP53  variant  encodes  a 

transcriptionally inactive p53-E339_F341del and promotes LFS with early onset of various types of cancer.

Methods
Probands
The  proband  fulfilling  the  hereditary  breast  cancer  germline  genetic  testing  criteria  was  initially  tested  for 
germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 2015 and then re-analyzed in 2022 using the CZECANCA panel 
NGS17,39. None of the relatives with cancer were available for genetic testing. All healthy relatives who consented 
to  genetic  testing  underwent  targeted,  variant-specific  germline  genetic  testing.  All  participants  provided 
informed consent during the study. The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the Masaryk Memorial 
Cancer Institute (OEGN/1) and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Antibodies and reagents
The  following  antibodies  were  used:  p53  (sc-6243,  IF  dilution  1:100),  p21  (sc-6246,  IF  dilution  1:100,  WB 
1:1000), and importin beta (sc-137016) from Santa Cruz; MDM2 (OP46, IF dilution 1:100) from Calbiochem; 
histone H3 (14269S, WB 1:1000), GAPDH (5174S, WB 1:1000) and p53 (9282S, WB 1:1000) from Cell Signaling 
Technology;  Alexa  Fluor-conjugated  secondary  antibodies  (Thermo  Scientific).  MDM2  inhibitor  nutlin-3 
(Medchemexpress) was diluted in DMSO and used at final concentration 9 µM40.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
Protein electrophoresis of the whole cell lysates (20 µg) was performed as described previously using 5–20% 
gradient gels and Tris/Glycine/SDS solutions (Bio Rad)41–43. After western blotting, nitrocellulose membrane 
was probed with the indicated primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and the signal was developed 
using ECL reagents and X-ray films. Tested proteins (p53 or p21) and the loading controls (histone H3, GAPDH 
or importin beta) were analyzed from the identical gel exploiting their different electrophoretic mobility.

Plasmids
DNA  fragment  carrying  the  coding  sequence  of  human  TP53  was  inserted  into  pCW57-RFP-P2A-MCS 
plasmid (Addgene ID: 78933) allowing for doxycycline-inducible expression of turbo RFP reporter and p53. 
Subsequently,  c.1015_1023del  variant  coding  for  p53-E339_F341del  was  introduced  into  the  plasmid  by  site 
directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Cells
Immortalized human retinal pigment epithelia RPE1-hTERT cells (referred to as RPE) were from ATCC. Cells 
were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 6% FBS (Gibco), Penicillin (10 U/mL) and Streptomycin 
(0.1  mg/mL). RPE-TP53-KO cells were  generated  by transfection  of RPE cells by a complex of sgRNA  C A U 
U G C U U G G G A C G G C A A G G (Sigma) targeting exon 4 of the TP53 gene and purified TrueCut protein Cas9 
v2 using CRISPRMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Selection of cells with inactivated TP53 was performed by

cultivation in the presence of nutlin-3 for 3 weeks followed by expansion of single cell clones. Complete loss of 
p53  expression  was  confirmed  by  immunoblotting  and  by  immunofluorescence  microscopy.  Stable  cell  lines 
were  generated  by  transfection  of  RPE-TP53-KO  cells  with  pCW57-RFP-P2A-TP53-WT  or  c.1015_1023del 
plasmids followed by selection with geneticin for 3 weeks and flow cytometry-mediated sorting of RFP-positive 
cell after short (6 h) pulse of doxycycline.

Quantitative microscopy
Parental  RPE  and  RPE-TP53-KO  cells  stably  transfected  with  pCW57-RFP-P2A-TP53-WT  or  pCW57-RFP-
P2A-TP53-c1015_1023del plasmids were treated with doxycycline (2 µg/mL) and nutlin-3 (9 µM) overnight. 
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed by 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1 TX-100 in PBS and incubated with 
p53 and MDM2 or p53 and p21 antibodies for 2 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa 
conjugated  secondary  antibodies  for  2  h  and  finally,  after  washing  with  PBS  coverslips  were  mounted  with 
Vectashield containing DAPI. Imaging was performed using Olympus ScanR station equipped with UPLXAPO 
40×/0.95 DRY CORR objectives. Image analysis was performed by Olympus ScanR analysis v3.2 ( h t t p s :  / / e v i d  e n 
t s c i  e n t i fi   c . c o m  / e n / p r  o d u c t s  / h i g h -  c o n t e n t - s c r e e n i n g / s c a n r) and FlowJo v9 software (https://flowjo.com/flowjo/) 
was used for data visualization. Cells expressing comparable levels of p53 as the parental RPE cells were gated 
and median nuclear intensity of MDM2 or p21 signal was determined. Median value was determined from at 
least 300 individual cells per condition.

Statistics
All experiments were performed in three or more biological repeats. Data visualization and statistical analysis 
was  performed  using  Prism  5  (GraphPad  Software,  https://www.graphpad.com/).  Plots  show  means,  error 
bars  show  standard  deviations.  Unpaired  two-tailed  T-test  was  used  for  evaluation  of  statistical  significance, 
****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

Oligomerization assay
The ability of p53 mutants to form tetramers was evaluated using a previously reported protocol44. Expression of 
p53 or p53-E339_F341del mutant was induced in reconstituted RPE-TP53-KO cells by doxycycline. Cells were 
incubated with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice, 
spinned down and 0.05% glutaraldehyde was added to the extracts. After 15 min, extracts were mixed 1:1 with 
the 2 × Laemli buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal p53 antibody.

Colony formation assay
One thousand of parental RPE, RPE-TP53-KO or freshly sorted RFP-positive RPE-TP53-KO cells reconstituted 
with  the  wild-type  p53  or  p53-E339_F341del  mutant  were  seeded  into  6-well-plates  and  were  grown  in  the 
presence of doxycycline and nutlin-3. After 10 days, cell colonies were washed with PBS, fixed and stained with 
1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 30 min. The colonies were counted manually using ImageJ.

FASAY analysis
FASAY analysis was performed as described previously16,45. Briefly, RNA isolated from peripheral blood was 
transcribed  to  cDNA  using  Superscript  II  Reverse  Transcriptase  (Thermo  Scientific)  and  oligo  dT.  Fragment 
corresponding  to  codons  42–374  of  the  TP53  was  PCR  amplified  and  was  transformed  together  with  the 
linearized  pSS16  vector  into  yeast  strain  yIG397  containing  ADE2  open  reading  frame  controlled  by  a  p53 
responsive promoter. Yeast were cultivated on a selection plate without leucine and with minimal amount of 
adenine at 35 °C and the fraction of red colonies containing the transcriptionally inactive p53 was calculated. 
DNA was sequenced from four red colonies and confirmed the presence of the tested TP53 variant.
