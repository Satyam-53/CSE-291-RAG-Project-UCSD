Summary

The germline TP53 p.R337H mutation is reported as the most common germline TP53 variant. It exists at a remarkably high frequency in
the population of southeast Brazil as founder mutation in two distinct haplotypes with the most frequent co-segregating with the
p.E134* variant of the XAF1 tumor suppressor and an increased cancer risk. Founder mutations demonstrate linkage disequilibrium
with neighboring genetic polymorphic markers that can be used to identify the founder variant in different geographic regions and
diverse populations. We report here a shared haplotype among Brazilian, Portuguese, and Spanish families and the existence of three
additional distinct TP53 p.R337H alleles. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing and Y-STR proﬁling of Brazilian carriers of the founder
TP53 p.R337H allele reveal an excess of Native American haplogroups in maternal lineages and exclusively European haplogroups in
paternal lineages, consistent with communities established through male European settlers with extensive intermarriage with Indige-
nous women. The identiﬁcation of founder and independent TP53 p.R337H alleles underlines the importance for considering the haplo-
type as a functional unit and the additive effects of constitutive polymorphisms and associated variants in modiﬁer genes that can in-
ﬂuence the cancer phenotype.

Introduction

TP53 is a tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle, senes-
cence, DNA repair, metabolism, and apoptosis in response to
DNA damage and other cellular stresses. Given this central
role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising
that p53 is frequently selected against in human cancer by
mutation, thus rendering this tumor suppressor inactive.
Although most TP53 mutations are somatically acquired, in-
dividuals who inherit an inactivating TP53 variant are highly
susceptible to developing cancer at an early age with diverse
tumor types and multiple malignancies.

The TP53 p.R337H variant, the most common germline
variant in The TP53 Database (formerly the International
Agency for Research on Cancer; IARC), was ﬁrst reported
in a pediatric patient of Portuguese ancestry with adreno-

cortical cancer treated in France.1 Previous studies have es-
tablished p.R337H as a hypomorphic, attenuated mutant
allele that confers a highly variable cancer risk ranging
from individuals who remain unaffected over their lifetime
to those who meet the clinical criteria for classic Li-
Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS).2–4 It is now recognized that
is a founder mutation5
the TP53 p.R337H variant
frequently found throughout south and southeastern
Brazil, including the major states of Sa˜o Paulo and Parana´
(total population of 60 million) being detected in one in
every 300 individuals.6,7 Carriers of the founder TP53
p.R337H variant share an identical DNA sequence for the
TP53 locus,8 with the majority retaining homology that
extends to the telomeric region of chromosome 17 encom-
passing a nonsense mutation (p.E134*) in XAF1 (X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1).8 Previous

studies have established XAF1 as a proapoptotic tumor
suppressor that functions within a positive autoregulatory
loop with TP53.9 Consistent with these ﬁndings, individ-
uals who inherit the compound mutant haplotype (TP53
p.R337H; XAF1 p.E134*) are at an increased risk for cancer
in general, sarcomas, and multiple tumors compared with
those carriers with only the p.R337H mutation.8

Haplotype analysis makes it possible to discriminate be-
tween a founder mutation10 or a variant resulting from an
independent mutational event. This is particularly impor-
tant in the context of hypomorphic TP53 variants, as spe-
ciﬁc polymorphisms can impact p53 expression and func-
tion, and thus inﬂuence cancer risk.11,12 By integrating
genotype, haplotype, and ancestry analyses we have as-
sessed 38 TP53 p.R337H carriers from South America,
North America, Europe, South Africa, and Asia to deter-
mine the diversity of the TP53 p.R337H alleles.

Materials and methods

TP53 p.R337H carriers
Genomic DNA samples from 38 unrelated individuals (33 patients
with cancer, including 25 females) harboring the TP53 p.R337H
variant from 11 different countries (Brazil, Portugal, Spain, France,
Germany, England, United States, Japan, American Samoa, South
Africa, and Argentina) were included in this study (Table 1). Per-
sonal and family histories of cancer were collected by the genetic
counselor or physician at each participating institution. Genetic
testing was offered as a TP53 single gene analysis or as part of a
multi-gene hereditary cancer panel (Ambry Genetics, OvaNext;
Myriad, Myrisk Hereditary Cancer Test; Illumina, TruSight Hered-
itary Cancer Panel) with additional genetic ﬁndings included in
Table 1. The validation cohort included 86 unrelated (documented
for at least three generations) and unaffected Brazilian males who
carry the TP53 p.R337H allele. Appropriate institutional informed
consent guidelines were followed for all participants or caregivers.
This study was approved by local ethics committees and the insti-
tutional review board at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

Haplotype determination of recurrent TP53 p.R337H
alleles
Genomic DNA was isolated and used to determine TP53 sequence
and the XAF1 p.E134* variant status as previously reported.8 Addi-
tionally, ﬂuorescent-labelled PCR products for 10 polymorphic mi-
crosatellite markers located within (VNTRp53) or telomeric to the
TP53 locus (Table S1) were genotyped by using the ABI 3500
sequencer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) and sizes assigned to the
different fragments using GeneMapper v 6.0 (ThermoFisher Scien-
tiﬁc).8,13 Haplotypes were determined by segregation analysis of
genomic DNA from parents and descendants, loss of heterozygos-
ity in tumor samples, or inferred.

senting 750,000 individuals); ABraOM (abraom.ib.usp.br; archive

elderly (>70 years old) individuals from Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil); the Pre-
cision Oncology Knowledge Base (OncoKB; https://www.oncokb.

senting more than 7,000 genetic alterations in 134 cancer types);
and the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC;
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).

Mitochondrial DNA control region
The nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervari-
able segment 1 (HVI; between nucleotide positions 16024 and
16365), segment 2 (HV2; between nucleotide positions 73 and 340),
and segment 3 (HV3, covering the position 438 to 574) of mtDNA
control region was determined for 37 of 38 probands, and available
family members (n ¼ 26). We have also determined the mtDNA
haplotype for all Brazilian male individuals harboring the p.R337H
allele (validation cohort) inherited from their mother (n ¼ 45).

Ampliﬁcation of the mtDNA control region was performed by us-
ing L15781 50-CCCTTTTACCATCATTGGACA-30 and H727 50-AGGG
TGAACTCACTGGAACG-30 primers. Ampliﬁed segments were seq-
uenced by using L15781, H16478, L109, H408, and H727 primers
as previously described.14 Resulting sequences were compared with
the Homo sapiens mitochondrion, complete genome (NCBI reference
sequence: NC_012920.1), known as revised Cambridge Reference
Sequence (rCRS). Haplogrep software (https://haplogrep.i-med.ac.
at/), EMPOP (https://empop.online/), and visual inspection analyses
were used to deﬁne the mtDNA haplogroups.

Y chromosome markers
A set of 23 Y-STRs (short tandem repeats) was analyzed for 13 un-
related male p.R337H carriers and four ﬁrst-degree male relatives
in the main cohort of 38 individuals using the PowerPlex Y23 Sys-
tem (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Y-STR haplotypes
were also determined for Brazilian male individuals harboring the
p.R337H allele (validation cohort) that was paternally inherited
(n ¼ 41). Alleles were separated and detected on an ABI 3500
sequencer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) and sizes were assigned to
the different fragments using GeneMapper v 6.0 (ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc). The alleles were named according to the number of
repeated units, based on the sequenced allelic ladder following In-
ternational Society for Forensic Genetics recommendations.15,16
The classiﬁcation of Y chromosome haplogroup was done using
the Haplogroup Predictor program FTDNA 2.0 (http://www.hprg.
com/hapest5/index.html) and Y chromosome Haplotype Refer-
ence Database (https://yhrd.org/search).

a 16-base pair sequence in intron 3. In this cohort of TP53
p.R337H carriers, R72 co-segregates with A1 (R72/A1) and
P72 co-segregates with A2 (P72/A2). Excluding one undeter-
mined case (#38), carriers with R72/A1 were more frequently
observed (n ¼ 30) compared with P72/A2 genotype (n ¼ 7),
establishing two distinct TP53 p.R337H alleles. Extending
the analysis to include the polymorphic marker VNTRp53,
a pentanucleotide (AAAAT)n repeat within the 6.1-kb-long
TP53 intron 1,17,18 the p53CA(n) polymorphic marker,19
and the XAF1 p.E134* variant,8 we delineated ﬁve TP53
p.R337H haplotypes (Figure 1; Table S2).

that

The most common TP53 p.R337H haplotype (hereafter
Hap1) (n ¼ 16 carriers; two homozygous) spanned from
D17S796 (chr17:6,251,522–6,251,775; GRCh37/hg19) to
D17S952 (chr17:9,113,650–9,113,834; GRCh37/hg19) and
contains the XAF1 p.E134* variant. An identical, but shorter,
lacks XAF1 p.E134*,
p.R337H haplotype (Hap2),
extended from D17S578 (chr17:6,823,880; GRCh37/hg19)
to the marker p53(CA)n (chr17:7,617,440 -7,617,490;
GRCh37/hg19) (n ¼ 4 individuals) (Figure 1; Table S2). These
two TP53 p.R337H haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2), which
comprise the R72/A1 polymorphisms and consistent alleles
for VNTRp53(n) and p53(CA)n have been characterized as a
founder p.R337H variant, widespread in Brazil.5,8 Identical
Hap1 (n ¼ 7) and Hap2 haplotypes (n ¼ 1) were also identi-
ﬁed in the eight unrelated families from Spain and Portugal
(Table 1; Table S2).

A third TP53 p.R337H haplotype containing the R72/A1
polymorphisms but distinct from Hap1 and Hap2 based on

allelic differences in the VNTRp53(n) and p53CA(n) poly-
morphic markers (Hap3) was observed in 10 probands
from Europe and the United States (Figure 1; Table S2). A
TP53 p.R337H allele with P72/A2 (Hap4) was observed in
six individuals from the United States. A documented de
novo TP53 p.R337H variant with P72/A2 (Hap5) was iden-
tiﬁed in a pediatric ACT patient from an American Samoa
family (Table 1).20 In addition, a heterozygous TP53
p.R337H proband with ACT from South Africa (#38)21
was identiﬁed, but the haplotype, and whether it was in-
herited or de novo, was not determined due to unavailabil-
ity of parental DNA or tumor samples. Nonetheless, micro-
satellite analysis excluded this germline variant as being
Hap 1 or Hap2.

The country of birth and migration status when known
for each proband was annotated (Figure 2; Table 1). Car-
riers of Hap1 (n ¼ 3) and Hap2 (n ¼ 2) identiﬁed in the
United States and Japan are known to have immigrated
from Brazil (Table 1). However, seven of the eight families
from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) report no
connection to Brazil.

Frequency of reported TP53 p.R377H alleles in public
databases
Of the 4,453 reported germline mutations (n ¼ 1,655 fam-
ilies) in The TP53 Database (R20, July 2019 version; https://
tp53.isb-cgc.org/), p.R337H was observed in 305 individuals
(n ¼ 117 families) representing 240 patients with cancer and
65 carriers unaffected by cancer. This database includes cases
from Brazil (n ¼ 282; 101 families), France (n ¼ 7; 6 families),

#24 (39 years old), presently unaffected
by cancer, was self-reported to be of
Ashkenazi Jewish descendant with no
remarkable family history of cancer,
except for a nephew with a diagnosis of
choroid plexus carcinoma at age 2.
Excluding two carriers who developed
childhood ACT (proband #37, de novo
p.R337H variant; proband #38, de novo
or inherited not determined), nearly all pediatric tumors in
the current cohort (n ¼ 14) were associated with the Hap1
and Hap2 founder p.R337H mutation (n ¼ 13; 93%).

Ancestry of the TP53 p.R337H variants
The maternal genetic composition of carriers of the TP53
p.R337H variant was investigated by characterizing the
mitochondrial control region sequences (HV1-3) from the
37 probands (Table S3; proband #30 DNA unavailable).
Altogether, TP53 p.R337H carriers fall into four major
mtDNA haplogroups with the predominance being of Euro-
pean descent (H, J, K, R, U, V, X; n ¼ 23, 61%) followed by
Native American (A–D; n ¼ 6, 16%), African (L; n ¼ 6,
16%), and Asian descent (M7c; n ¼ 2, 5%). The paternal
composition was examined by genotyping 23 Y-STRs from
13 male probands in this cohort. These results indicate
that the paternal lineage of carriers is associated with the
following European haplogroups: R1b (n ¼ 6), J1 (n ¼ 3),
I2a1 (n ¼ 2), G2a (n ¼ 1), and E1b1b (n ¼ 1) (Table S4).

Ancestry of Hap 1 (n ¼ 65) and Hap2 (n ¼ 21) was analyzed
in a validation cohort of 86 independent Brazilian male TP53
p.R337H carriers who were identiﬁed through a general pop-
ulation neonatal screening program (Tables S3 and S4).6 This
cohort provided the opportunity to determine Y-STR
proﬁling and mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis of car-
inheritance of TP53
riers with paternal and maternal
p.R337H, respectively. Of those male Brazilian carriers who
inherited the p.R337H variant from their fathers (n ¼ 41;
33 Hap1 and 8 Hap2), all Y-STR haplotypes were found to
be associated with European/Eurasian descent, primarily
the major haplogroup R (n ¼ 23, 56%; in particular R1b,
n ¼ 22) followed by E (n ¼ 7; 17%), I (n ¼ 5; 12%), J (n ¼ 3;
7%), L (n ¼ 2; 5%), and Q (n ¼ 1; 2%) (Table S4). For those
male Brazilian carriers who inherited the p.R337H variant
from their mothers (n ¼ 45; 32 Hap1 and 13 Hap2), mito-
chondrial haplotypes were predominantly associated with
Native American ancestry (haplogroups A–D; n ¼ 33, 73%),
followed by European/Eurasia (n ¼ 9, 20%) and African
(n ¼ 3, 7%) haplogroups (Table S3). Although the 86 male

ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) also lists
21 entries for the TP53 p.R337H allele (variation ID 12379),
with 18 being classiﬁed as pathogenic and three as likely
pathogenic. Of note, p.R337H cases are often presumed to
be the founder variant without recognizing differences in
TP53 sequences (e.g., constitutive internal polymorphisms)
or associated haplotypes.22,23

TP53 p.R337H was also reported as a somatic mutation
in (1) The TP53 Database (n ¼ 4), (2) The OncoKB database
(n ¼ 3), and (3) The COSMIC database (COSM43882,
COSM4173039; n ¼ 22). However, the germline status of
these patients with p.R337H-positive tumors was not es-
tablished. The TP53 p.R337H variant was not reported at
Global Biobank Engine and ABraOM databases. However,
it was observed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gno-
mAD) in three female individuals (two cancer patients, one
unaffected by cancer), two identiﬁed as Latino/Admixed
American individuals.

Interestingly, the TP53 p.R337H variant has also been
observed in two ancient genomes (European Nucleotide
Archive; ENA Browser [www.ebi.ac.uk]), one carrier from
Mongolia and the other from Italy. Whether these ancient
alleles are ﬁxed in the human lineage or independent
events was not determined.24

Family histories of cancer
The cancer history for the 38 p.R337H carriers in this study
was collected (Table 1). All six Hap4 probands developed
breast cancer at an early age (Table 1; range from 29 to
46 years old) with ﬁve developing multiple LFS core tumor
types. Except for one proband (#22), all cases tested nega-
tive for BRCA1/2 mutations.

The cancer phenotype for Hap3 probands (n ¼ 10) appears
to be milder than Hap4, with four adults currently unaffected
by cancer and the remaining six carriers having developed
non-LFS core tumors with late onset (Table 1). Hap3 proband

individuals selected for this study were recruited from
different families and documented for at least three genera-
tions, we have identiﬁed relatedness in 15 cases (17%) based
on shared mtDNA sequences (n ¼ 11; A–D haplogroups) or
Y-STR (n ¼ 4; I2b1 and E1b1a haplogroups), consistent
with a founder effect5,8 (Tables S3–S5).

Discussion

In the present study we have identiﬁed ﬁve distinct TP53
p.R337H haplotypes, with two (Hap1 and Hap2) sharing
an identical Caucasian founder allele widespread in the
Brazilian population.5,8 The TP53 p.R337H founder
variant co-segregates with XAF1 p.E134* in the majority
of Brazilian cases (Hap1) and as a single mutation
(Hap2).8 Hap1 was also observed in the majority of cases
from Spain and Portugal. The remaining three TP53
p.R337H haplotypes (Hap3-5) that have been identiﬁed
outside of Brazil are distinct from the founder allele based
on internal polymorphisms and polymorphic markers
along chromosome 17p.

The p.R337H variant has been functionally character-
ized by studies in vitro and in vivo as hypomorphic,2,25–27
with individuals exibiting a wide range of cancer pheno-
types. In many instances, however, the p.R337H variant
has been classiﬁed as pathogenic and carriers, independent
of haplotype and other possible pathogenic variants, are
considered to be associated with classic LFS.28

The TP53 p.R337H haplotypes identiﬁed here diverge
in internal TP53 polymorphisms, such as codon 72
(Pro72Arg) and PIN3 (intron 3), reported to affect p53
expression and function.11,12 Notably, codon 72 is part
of the p53 proline-rich motif that is critical for interac-
tions with MDM-2,29 ASPPs,30 XAF1,9 NF-kB,31 and pro-
teins containing the SH3 domain.32 Speciﬁcally, the R72
variant is more active at stimulating cellular apoptosis
and suppressing cellular transformation.33 In addition,
the PIN3 variant (A2) has been associated with decreased
p53 expression34 and several case-control studies have re-
ported an increased risk of various cancer types associated
with the A2 allele in Caucasians, with the most consistent
association reported for breast and colorectal cancers.35 It
is well established that the combination of speciﬁc vari-
ants in cis can potentially modify the penetrance of cod-
ing variants,36 with these variants exhibiting much
smaller effects individually but with additive haplotypic
effects. Phenotypic variability associated with another
variant in cis is exempliﬁed by the presence of XAF1
p.E134* in a subset of TP53 p.R337H carriers (Hap1)
that are at higher risk of cancer in general, sarcomas,
and multiple tumors compared with those with TP53
p.R337H alone (Hap2).8

Although the number of carriers of Hap3 and Hap4 were
not sufﬁcient to establish a clear haplotype-cancer pheno-
type association, we did observe a pattern whereby Hap4
carriers more closely resembled classical LFS, including

breast cancers, sarcomas, and multiple primary tumors.
In contrast, Hap3 carriers present generally with tumors
not seen typically in LFS and at late onset with incomplete
penetrance, suggestive of a lower risk of cancer.

To determine the ancestry and occurrence of TP53
p.R337H variant within the framework of the history of
Brazil, our analysis of mitochondrial haplogroups of carriers
deﬁned an excess of Native American haplogroups (A–D;
73%) in maternal lineages. Although many native groups
in Brazil have vanished, particularly in southeast regions,37
our observed 73% of Brazilian p.R337H carriers with the
Native American matrilineal lineages is in clear contrast
with present day Brazilians in the same region that still carry
the genetic imprinting of early colonization phase but with
much more uniform distribution: 39% European, 33%
Amerindian, and 28% African lineages.37 Y-STR proﬁling
of carriers from the paternal lineage revealed exclusively Eu-
ropean haplogroups, particularly R1b. This composition
indicates a remarkable signature among communities estab-
lished by European male settlers with extensive inter-
marriage with Indigenous women.38 We postulate that Ibe-
rian Peninsula Europeans introduced the TP53 p.R337H
variant in the Brazilian population in early colonial times.
Our hypothesis is based on the knowledge that the
European-Amerindian admixture started soon after the
arrival of the ﬁrst colonizers.38 In addition, we observed a
high frequency of Y-STR haplogroup R1b in Brazilian carriers
as well as in TP53 p.R337H carriers from Portugal and Spain.
It is well established that R1b haplogroup is the most com-
mon Y chromosome branch of Atlantic Europe, the most
frequent haplogroup in the Iberian Peninsula and with great
representation among Sephardic Jews.39 Of note, our Span-
ish p.R337H carriers are from Extremadura, a Spanish border
region adjacent to Portugal, with large Sephardic commu-
nities and a prominent source for migrants to the Americas
during the 16th century.40

Although we cannot determine whether the p.R337H
founder allele ﬁrst arose within the context of Hap1 or
Hap2, we have observed the uncoupling of XAF1 p.E134*
and TP53 p.R337H in several Hap1 Brazilian families.8 These
ﬁndings suggest that the region separating XAF1 and TP53
on chromosome 17 is susceptible to recombination and
that gene conversion could promote haplotype diversity.
These ﬁndings also highlight the importance of determining
the haplotype of this hypomorphic mutation in each carrier
even when occurring within the same family.8

In conclusion, we have identiﬁed ﬁve distinct TP53
p.R337H haplotypes that differ in speciﬁc intragenic and ex-
tragenic polymorphisms, as well as associated modiﬁers.
Given the hypomorphic nature of p.R337H, in contrast to
pathogenic DNA binding domain TP53 mutants, its tumor
suppressor activity can be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by associ-
ated polymorphisms and variants. One such example is the
p.R337H founder mutation that is common throughout
southern Brazil, but in the context of two haplotypes that
differ in the status of XAF1 and tumor susceptibility (Hap1
and Hap2).8,41,42 As shown here, additional non-founder

independent p.R337H alleles (Hap3-5) have been identiﬁed
that also likely inﬂuence cancer risk. Therefore, genetic coun-
selors and health care providers must be aware of these
distinct p.R337H haplotypes and the potential implications
of their associated differences on p53 expression, structure,
and function, and consequently cancer risk.
