Abstract

The balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is critical for normal development and for the
maintenance of homeostasis in adult organisms. Disruption of this balance has been implicated in a large
number of disease processes, ranging from autoimmunity and neurodegenerative disorders to cancer. The
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, responsible for mediating the majority of intracellular proteolysis, plays a
crucial role in the regulation of many normal cellular processes, including the cell cycle, differentiation and
apoptosis. Apoptosis in cancer cells is closely connected with the activity of ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.
The peptide-aldehyde proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucine) induces the
apoptosis of cells by a different intermediary pathway. Although the pathway of induction of apoptosis is
different, it plays a crucial role in anti-tumor treatment. There are many cancer-related molecules in which
the protein levels present in cells are regulated by a proteasomal pathway; for example, tumor inhibitors
(P53, E2A, c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos), transcription factors (transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B, IkBa,
HIFI, YYI, ICER), cell cycle proteins (cyclin A and B, P27, P21, IAP1/3), MG132 induces cell apoptosis
through formation of reactive oxygen species or the upregulation and downregulation of these factors,
which is ultimately dependent upon the activation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases. In this article
we review the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in order to provide information required for
research.

Key words: anti-tumor, apoptosis, MG132, proteasome inhibitor, tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

The balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is
critical for normal development and for the maintenance
of homeostasis in adult organisms. The disruption of
this balance has been implicated in a large number of
disease processes, ranging from autoimmunity and neu-
rodegenerative disorders to cancer. Although apoptosis
can be triggered by many diverse intracellular and extra-
cellular stimuli, once initiated a conserved set of mol-
ecules are recruited for the execution of the cell death
program, which is ultimately dependent upon the acti-
vation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases.1

The ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, responsible for
mediating most intracellular proteolysis, plays a crucial
role in the regulation of many normal cellular processes,
including the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis.
There are many cancer-related molecules in which the
protein levels present in the cells are regulated by pro-
teasomal pathway, for example, tumor inhibitors (P53,
E2A, c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos), transcription factors (nuclear
factor-kappa B [NF-kB], IkBa, HIFI, YYI, ICER), cell
cycle proteins (cyclin A and B, P27, P21, IAP1/3).
Apoptosis in cancer cells is closely connected with
the activity of ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. The
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is a highly speciﬁc extra-
lysosomal system for the selective degradation of short-
lived proteins. The proteasome is present in the nucleus
and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells as a highly con-
served multi-catalytic enzyme complex. Proteins that are
degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome mechanism are
ﬁrst conjugated to ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid, highly

teasome structure.

conserved residue. Ubiquitinated proteins are recog-
nized by the 26S proteasome, which hydrolyzes and
degrades ubiquitinated protein substrates,
including
transcription factors, cell cycle regulators and apoptotic
proteins. The 26S proteasome is composed of a 20S core
protease, in which proteins are digested to short pep-
tides, and one or two 19S regulatory particles, which
confer adinosine triphosphate (ATP) dependence and
substrate speciﬁcity (Fig. 1).2 The 20S proteasome, the
large core unit with a molecular mass of approximately
700 kDa is made up of multiple subunits and performs
several peptidolytic functions
to maintain cellular
homeostasis by acting as an important disposal mecha-
nism.3 The 20S proteasome is a cylindrical particle com-
posed of four stacked rings, making it look like a barrel.
The rings form a tunnel in which the target proteins are
hydrolyzed, after which ubiquitin is released, to be
reused in the proteolytic pathway. The 19S recognizes
and binds to polyubiquitylated proteins, releases the
attached ubiquitinated proteins as free monomers,
unfolds the protein substrates and directs the unfolded
proteins into the 20S lumen for degradation. In this way,
ubiquitinated proteins conjugation,
the proteasome
architecture and their linkage to ATP hydrolysis ensure
that only unwanted proteins are selectively degraded.4
The peptide-aldehyde proteasome inhibitor MG132
(carbobenzoxyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal)
a
natural triterpene proteasome inhibitor derived from
a Chinese medicinal plant and is able to suppress the
growth of human prostate cancer in nude mice. It is a
peptide aldehyde that inhibits 20S proteasome activity
by covalently binding to the active site of the beta sub-
units and effectively blocks the proteolytic activity of the
26S proteasome complex (Fig. 2). MG132 inhibits the
growth of tumor cells by inducing the cell cycle arrest as

well as triggering apoptosis.5 The pathway of induction
of apoptosis can be divided, as discussed below.

MG132 INDUCES APOPTOSIS
THROUGH FORMATION OF REACTIVE
OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)

MG132 has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death
through the formation of ROS. ROS formation and
glutathione (GSH) depletion due to proteasome inhibi-
tors may cause mitochondrial dysfunction and subse-
quent cytochrome release, which leads to cell viability
loss.6 Enhanced oxidative stress and defects in mito-
chondrial function are involved in the induction of apo-
ptotic cell death. The membrane permeability transition
of mitochondria is recognized as a central event in the
course of toxic and oxidative forms of cell injury. The
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore causes a depolarization of the transmembrane
potential, the release of Ca2t and cytochrome c and the
loss of oxidative phosphorylation, which results in the
loss of cell viability7 (Fig. 3).

Figure 3 Schematic diagram of MG132-induced cell apoptosis through formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GSH,
glutathione.

ROS include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide
anion and hydroxyl radical.8 These molecules have
recently been implicated in regulating many important
cellular events including transcription factor activation,
gene expression, differentiation and cell proliferation.9
GSH is the main non-protein antioxidant in the cell and
provides electrons for enzymes such as glutathione per-
oxidase, which reduce H2O2 to H2O. GSH has been
shown to be crucial for cell proliferation, cell cycle pro-
gression and apoptosis and is known to protect cells
from toxic insult by detoxifying toxic metabolites of
drugs. Although cells possess antioxidant systems to
control their redox state, which is important for their
survival,
the excessive production of ROS can be
induced and gives rise to the activation of events that
lead to death or survival in different cell types.10 ROS
formation and glutathione depletion due to proteasome
inhibitors may cause mitochondrial dysfunction and
subsequent cytochrome c release, which leads to cell
viability loss.11

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are a
large family of serine/threonine kinases, which are major
components of signaling pathways in cell proliferation,
differentiation and cell death.12 There are currently
four known MAPK: the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
stress-activated protein kinase and the p38. Each MAPK
pathway has relatively different upstream activators and
speciﬁc substrates. ROS are known to induce ERK phos-
phorylation and activate the ERK pathway. There is
evidence that JNK and p38 are strongly activated by
ROS or by a mild oxidative shift of the intracellular
leading to apoptosis. In
thiol–disulﬁde redox state,
relation to MAPK activities in MG132-treated cells,
MG132 increases the activities of ERK and p38 but does
not affect JNK activity. The signaling pathways of
MAPK are involved in the inhibition of growth but are
not closely related to cell death by MG132, because

MG132 dose not activate JNK in cells. The enhance-
ment of growth inhibition of MG132-treated cells by
JNK inhibitor probably results from the downregulation
of basal JNK activity and induces apoptosis.13

MG132 INDUCES APOPTOSIS
THROUGH COOPERATION WITH
APO2L OR TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR
(TNF)-RELATED APOPTOSIS INDUCING
LIGAND (TRAIL)

TRAIL is a novel cytokine that belongs to the TNF
family of ligands and is a potentially important anti-
cancer agent awaiting clinical
trials. Unfortunately,
some cancer cells exhibit resistance to TRAIL, which
could limit the use of this potentially promising antican-
cer agent. TRAIL has attracted considerable attention as
a novel anticancer agent since it appears to selectively
induce apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells
of various tissues types.14

TRAIL is expressed as a type 2 membrane protein and
also exists as a soluble form after proteolytic cleavage of
its extracellular domain. TRAIL mediates its apoptotic
effects by binding to its membrane death receptors
including death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 (also known
as TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, respectively).15 TRAIL
also binds to two other receptors named TRAIL-R3 and
TRAIL-R4. These receptors are called anti-apoptotic
decoy receptors since TRAIL-R3 is a glycosylphosphati-
dylinositol -linked molecule lacking the death domain,
whereas TRAIL-R4 carries a deleted version of the
death domain and accordingly, neither can transduce
apoptotic signals.16

By upregulating the TRAIL death receptor DR5,
MG132 cooperates with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in
general and in TRAIL-resistant human cancer cells in
particular. The combination of MG132 and TRAIL
induce the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and

that of the intrinsic pathway (including cytochrome c
and Smac release and caspase-9 activation). The com-
bination of both agents also promotes caspase-8 and
caspase-3 activation. The combination of MG132 and
TRAIL, by engaging DR5, that is the extrinsic pathway,
appears to overcome the Bax deﬁciency-induced defects
in the intrinsic pathway and induce apoptosis in tumor
cells14 (Fig. 4).

MG132 INDUCES APOPTOSIS
THROUGH TRIMERIZATION OF HSF1

Heat shock proteins, in addition to their role in protect-
ing cells from thermal stress, have been shown to play
multiple roles in cell cycle progression, cell development
and cell differentiation, signal transduction and apopto-
sis. Heat shock factors (HSF) are a multi-gene family
of transcription factors involved in the transcriptional
regulation of heat shock genes.17 HSF is essential for the
induction of heat shock proteins and for the acquisition
of thermotolerance in mammalian cells.18

Among the various members of HSF gene family,
HSF1 is speciﬁcally involved in the transactivation of
stress-inducible hsp genes and is the key factor in the
regulation of hsp gene expression. Upon heat shock,
HSF1 trimerizes, acquires DNA-binding ability and
becomes hyperphosphorylated.19

In the presence of MG132 the activity of protein
kinase C, casein kinase II and P38 MAPK targeting
HSF1 is upregulated through the ubiquitin–proteasome
dependent pathway.20 Furthermore, kinases targeting
HSF1 upon heat shock and kinases targeting HSF1
during MG132 treatment appear to be distinct, recon-
ﬁrming that activation of heat shock response is under
the control of multiple complex signaling pathways.
HSF1 is capable of efﬁciently activating transcription
only after heat shock. The increase in transcriptional
activity is correlated with an increase in the phosphory-
lation of HSF1, and it has been proposed that this
hyperphosphorylation is responsible for the increase in

HSF’s activation potential, although no causal link has
been established. MG132 has been conﬁrmed that the
activity of HSF1 is highly regulated both at the level
of DNA binding and at the level of transcriptional
activation.20

MG132 induces hyperphosphorylation and trimeriza-
tion of HSF1, and transactivates heat shock genes at
37°C. The upregulated protein kinase(s) may efﬁciently
phosphorylate HSF1, or facilitate HSF1 to remain in its
hyperphosphorylated state, and prevent the recovery
of hyperphosphorylated HSF1 to the pre-heat-shocked,
dephosphorylated state. Alternatively, MG132 treat-
ment may lead to the phosphorylation of HSF1 at amino
acid residues that were different from those induced
by heat shock, and a different form of phosphorylated
HSF1 may have a different impact on its transactivation
activity.

MG132 INDUCES APOPTOSIS
THROUGH NF-KB INHIBITION

The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)
plays an important regulatory role in the control of
inﬂammation, oncogenic transformation, tumor pro-
gression and the acquisition of resistance to anticancer
drugs. The NF-kB family comprises p50/p105, p52/
p100, p65, c-Rel and RelB proteins that exist in an
inactive state as homodimers or heterodimers bound to
inhibitory NF-kB proteins in the cytoplasm.21 Diverse
stimuli, including TNF alpha and oxidants, activate the
IkB kinase complex, which phosphorylates and triggers
the proteasome-dependent degradation of IkB-alpha,
the predominant NF-kB inhibitory molecule. NF-kB
then translocates to the nucleus and modulates tran-
scription by binding to speciﬁc DNA sequences in target
promoters.22

There are multiple mechanisms by which NF-kB pro-
motes cell survival. Target genes induced by NF-kB that
are important for the control of cell survival include
the anti-apoptotic bcl-xL, cFLIP, cIAP1/2 and Bcl-2, and

the antioxidants superoxide dismutase22 and ferritin
heavy chain,23 which act to prevent the pro-apoptotic
machinery activation. NF-kB overstimulation has been
associated with cellular resistance to classical chemo-
therapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, etoposide and
imatinib, and it has been correlated with chemotherapy
resistance and therapy failure in vivo.

MG132 acts as a powerful apoptotic agent in several
tumor cell lines, and much of the MG132 activity has
been attributed to NF-kB inhibition through the inhi-
bition of IkB degradation.24 Since the degradation of
inhibitors of kB proteins (IkBa and IkBb) is essential for
the canonical pathway of NF-kB activation and the
aberrant expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is
regulated in part by IkB, the inhibition of proteasome
function has emerged as a useful strategy to manipulate
programmed cell death25 (Fig. 5).

Noxa is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only member of the
Bcl-2 family of proteins that is upregulated at a tran-
scriptional level by the nuclear protein p53 in response
to cellular stresses such as DNA damage or growth
factor deprivation. Noxa is able to interact with anti-
apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and causes the
release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, leading to the
activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis.28
MG132 inhibits the growth of several tumor cells inde-
pendently of p53 status and it induces the pro-apoptotic
protein Noxa via a p53-independent mechanism that
leads to caspase-dependent apoptosis29 (Fig. 6).

In summary,

the proteasome

inhibitor MG132
induces the apoptosis of cells, although the pathway of
induction of apoptosis is different, it plays a crucial role
in anti-tumor treatment. Here, we review the mecha-
nism of the induction of apoptosis, in order to provide
information for research.

MG132 INDUCES APOPTOSIS
THROUGH P53-INDEPENDENT
PATHWAY

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is known to mediate
apoptosis induced by the DNA tumor virus oncopro-
teins, adenovirus E1A and SV40 T antigen,26 it activates
cellular death programs through multiple pathways.
Because the high frequency of p53 mutations in human
tumors is believed to contribute to resistance to com-
monly used chemotherapeutic agents, it is important
to identify drugs that
induce p53-independent cell
death and to deﬁne the mechanisms of action of such
drugs.27
