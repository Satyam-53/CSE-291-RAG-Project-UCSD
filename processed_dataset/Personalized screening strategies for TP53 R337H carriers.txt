Summary
Background Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a predisposition associated with early onset malignant tumors caused by
germline pathogenic variants in the TP53 gene. Although rare worldwide, LFS is prevalent in Southern Brazil due to
the founder pathogenic variant R337H. Here, we assessed tumor patterns and temporal trends, cancer risk, and sex
differences of adult R337H carriers and carriers of other LFS-associated variants.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 708 adults, combining data from two sources: the Brazilian Li-Fraumeni
Syndrome Study cohort and the NCI TP53 database. We assessed the clinical characteristics of 303 adults with
R337H and compared them with those associated with 405 carriers of other TP53 variants.

Findings R337H carriers, compared to adult carriers of other TP53 variants typical of LFS, had a lower cumulative risk
of developing cancer (54% vs 78%). Female R337H carriers were at a higher risk than males (65% vs 30%) and had a
higher risk of developing a second primary cancer, underscoring a strong sex bias not observed in carriers of other
variants. The most common cancers were breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma in females, and soft tissue sarcoma
and prostate cancer in males. Common second malignancies were breast cancer in females and lung cancer in males.

Interpretation This study shows that R337H is associated with a lifetime risk of multiple LFS-spectrum cancers but
with incomplete penetrance, particularly in males. Our ﬁndings suggest that R337H carriers would beneﬁt from
tailored surveillance and risk reduction strategies.

Introduction
TP53 is a multi-functional gene commonly mutated in
human tumors, with more than 50% of cancers carrying
loss-of-function somatic mutations in TP53.1,2 De novo
germline pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) TP53
variants are thought to occur at a frequency of about

1:5000 births3 and carriers are associated with a lifetime
predisposition of developing multiple primary tumors
known as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS).4,5 The LFS
cancer spectrum is characterized by early-life tumors
including adrenocortical carcinoma, premenopausal
breast cancer, bone and soft tissue sarcomas, central

Research in context

Evidence before this study
Since 2001, the TP53 variant R337H (c.1010G>A;
p.Arg337His) has frequently been reported in the germline of
children with adrenocortical carcinoma and adults in Southern
Brazil, with an estimated prevalence of 0.3% in the local
population. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and
Google Scholar databases from January 2001 to December
2023, using the search terms “p.Arg337His”, “R337H”, “TP53
R337H”, and “R337H adult”. Studies were included if they
reported on TP53 R337H carriers and cancer outcomes, with
no language restrictions. Our literature review identiﬁed
approximately 140 published studies (PubMed). Most studies
focused on pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma or small case
series. Assessment of the existing evidence revealed a
signiﬁcant knowledge gap regarding comprehensive tumor
spectrum and cancer risk assessment in adult R337H carriers,
as previous studies were limited by small cohorts, pediatric
focus, or lack of long-term follow-up data in adult
populations.

Added value of this study
This study presents the Brazilian Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Study
(BLiSS), which comprises the largest cohort of adult TP53
R337H carriers ever assembled, including 303 carriers from
160 families. While previous studies have debated whether
R337H carriers exhibit full or attenuated Li-Fraumeni
Syndrome (LFS) features, our comprehensive analysis provides
a complete systematic assessment of cancer manifestations in
this population. Through detailed investigation of the BLiSS
cohort, we establish several key ﬁndings: (1) a comprehensive
tumor spectrum and lifetime cancer risk assessment speciﬁc
to adult R337H carriers; (2) temporal patterns of tumor

nervous system (CNS) cancers, and hematopoietic ma-
lignancies, among others.6

TP53

variant,

c.1010G>A;

In 2001, Ribeiro and colleagues reported that an
atypical
p.Arg337His
(R337H), was frequently found in the germline of chil-
dren with adrenocortical carcinoma in Southern Brazil.7
In subsequent years, a high number of children and
adult carriers of this variant were detected in the same
area, presenting complete or partial LFS traits.8 R337H
differs from most TP53 P/LP variants by its location in
exon 10, encoding the oligomerization domain of the
p53 protein, whereas the majority of variants causing
LFS occurs in exons 4–9 (encoding the DNA-binding
domain). R337H variant is carried by a founder haplo-
type of Lusitanian/Hispanic origin, estimated to be
present in about 0.3% of the population of Southern
Brazil.8–12 Over the past 15 years, the magnitude of
cancer risk caused by R337H has been a matter of
debate, some carriers presenting with full LFS traits and
many others with attenuated LFS features or remaining
apparently cancer-free over lifetime. Given its high

development that distinguish R337H from other pathogenic
TP53 variants; (3) signiﬁcant sex-speciﬁc differences in cancer
risk, with female carriers showing notably higher cancer
incidence, particularly for early-onset breast cancer; and (4)
distinct age-of-onset patterns that differentiate R337H from
other LFS-associated variants. These ﬁndings demonstrate
that while R337H carriers face substantial cancer risks within
the LFS spectrum, their risk pattern represents a distinct
subset of the classic LFS phenotype.

Implications of all the available evidence
The unique tumor spectrum and risk patterns identiﬁed in
adult R337H carriers demonstrate the need for tailored cancer
surveillance strategies distinct from standard LFS protocols.
Given the high prevalence of R337H in the Brazilian
population (0.3%), our ﬁndings may have clinical and public
health implications. For healthcare professionals and genetic
counselors, these data may help the development of R337H-
speciﬁc screening guidelines, particularly emphasizing earlier
and more intensive breast cancer surveillance in female
carriers. The sex-speciﬁc differences in cancer risk and age of
onset should inform personalized risk assessment and
prevention strategies. From a public health perspective, our
ﬁndings may help to justify population-speciﬁc screening
policies in regions with high R337H prevalence. Future
research should focus on identifying the molecular and
environmental factors that contribute to the variant’s variable
penetrance and distinct tumor spectrum. Additionally,
prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness
of targeted screening protocols in reducing cancer-related
mortality in this population.

prevalence, R337H confers a signiﬁcant cancer risk in
the Brazilian population. Therefore, detailed informa-
tion on lifetime cancer incidence, tumor spectrum and
incidence of multiple primary tumors is crucial for
developing awareness and appropriate screening and
risk reduction strategies.13 Of note, with the develop-
ment of genome sequencing as a basis for molecular
diagnosis, R337H represents a frequent ﬁnding in
adults, but current knowledge of tumor proﬁles in
R337H adult carriers is scarce14,15 and limited to studies
with few samples or individuals.12,16,17

Here, we report on the Brazilian Li-Fraumeni Syn-
drome Study (BLiSS), the largest cohort of Brazilian LFS
adults available to date. We provide a detailed assess-
ment of tumor spectrum, lifetime cancer risk, temporal
tumor trends and sex differences associated with R337H
and we compare them with those associated with other
P/LP variants found in Brazilians or in carriers from
other origins. We show that R337H entails a signiﬁcant
lifetime risk of multiple cancers, which recapitulates
many, but not all traits of LFS, with striking differences

between males and females. Overall, these results sug-
gest that tailored screening and risk reduction strategies
could be developed and adapted to the needs of R337H
carriers.

Methods
Brazilian Li-Fraumeni syndrome study (BLiSS)
cohort
We retrospectively investigated tumor spectrum, clinical
and demographic status in a cohort of 708 adults with
germline TP53 P/LP variants. P/LP variant status was
based on ClinGen TP53 Expert Panel Speciﬁcations to
the ACMG/AMP Variant Interpretation Guidelines for
TP53 (Version 1.3.0, https://cspec.genome.network/
cspec/ui/svi/doc/GN009). The cohort was constituted
from two datasets: (1) BLiSS, comprising 345 Brazilian
adult heterozygous carriers (age range 18–82 years,
median 42 years),
including 303 carriers (88%, 160
families) of TP53 c.1010G>A (R337H) and 42 carriers
(12%, 29 families) of other TP53 P/LP variants and (2)
363 adult carriers of other TP53 P/LP variants (age
range 18–90, median 38 years) from diverse geographic
areas, extracted from the NCI TP53 database (version
R20; https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/), a resource that compiles
annotations on TP53 carriers from the literature
(Supplementary Table S1). For the purposes of this
study, carriers of P/LP TP53 variants other than R337H
will be referred to as ‘non-R337H carriers’. In detail, the
BLISS cohort comprises 345 adult
individuals with
germline TP53 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP)
variants, of whom 303 carry the R337H variant and 42
have non-R337H variants. Among the R337H carriers,
155 were index cases, with 110 of these tested due to a
cancer diagnosis and 45 identiﬁed through cascade
testing of family members, being presymptomatic at the
time of testing. Of the 42 non-R337H carriers in the
BLISS cohort, 26 were index cases, with 24 tested due to
a cancer diagnosis and 2 identiﬁed pre-symptomatically.
Regarding the 363 non-R337H carriers from the TP53
database cohort, index case information was available
for 215 individuals, of whom 21 were conﬁrmed as in-
dex cases. However, information about the timing of
testing was not available for this group. This breakdown
helps account for potential testing bias by distinguishing
between individuals tested due to cancer diagnosis and
those identiﬁed pre-symptomatically (Supplementary
Table S2).

To differentiate between second primary breast tu-
mors and relapsed breast cancers, we applied the
following criteria: (1) Any new breast cancer in the
opposite breast was classiﬁed as a second primary tumor
and (2) For cancers occurring in the same breast as the
initial tumor, we considered it a second primary tumor
if one or more of the following conditions were met: (a)
The tumor showed a different invasiveness proﬁle (e.g.,
ductal carcinoma in situ followed by invasive ductal

carcinoma, or vice versa); (b) The new tumor was located
in a different quadrant of the breast; and (c) The
immunohistochemistry (IHC) subtype differed from the
initial tumor, speciﬁcally considering changes in estro-
gen receptor (ER) and HER2 status. Any ipsilateral
breast cancer that did not meet these criteria was clas-
siﬁed as a relapsed or recurrent cancer and was not
included in our analysis of second primary tumors.
Additionally, detailed histological subtypes of CNS
cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, and bone tumors are
provided in Supplementary Figure S1. This classiﬁca-
tion is based on the histopathological diagnoses recor-
ded in the BLISS cohort and the TP53 database.

Individuals recruited into BLISS were detected be-
tween 2018 and 2022 in a high familial cancer risk clinic
at Hospital Sírio-Libanês (Sao Paulo, Brazil). All subjects
tested positive for a germline P/LP TP53 variant either
by conventional targeted gene sequencing or by multi-
gene next generation sequencing panels. All clinical and
personal data were de-identiﬁed before data sharing and
analyses. Participants in the BLISS cohort were not
recruited through population screening for R337H car-
riers. Patients were identiﬁed through cancer screening
guidelines, by meeting clinical criteria for LFS, or
through cascade testing of
family members. This
ascertainment method was consistent for both R337H
and non-R337H carriers from our cohort. Importantly,
no population-based screening of unaffected individuals
was conducted to include additional patients in our
cohort. This study was approved by the institutional
research ethics committees in all centers (approval at the
coordinating center, Hospital Sírio-Libanês #3.830.276).
All patients signed a written informed consent. Data
from the NCI TP53 dataset are fully anonymous and
open-source. Finally, it is important to note that our
study speciﬁcally focused on characterizing the tumor
proﬁle of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) individuals in
adulthood. Consequently, our inclusion criteria delib-
erately excluded individuals with reported pediatric-
onset tumors.

Statistical analyses
Data processing, statistical analyses, and ﬁgures were
produced in the R software (version 4.0.3), using the
following R packages: ggplot2 (v3.3.6), ggpubr (v0.4.0),
survival (v3.2.13), survminer (v0.4.9), tidyverse (v1.3.1),
trackViewer (v1.24.2), and webr (v0.1.5). Figure colors
and esthetic edition were performed using the Inkscape
software (https://inkscape.org/). Sankey diagrams were
created using the SankeyMATIC web tool
(https://
sankeymatic.com/). Statistical comparisons between
patient groups were performed using Wilcoxon rank
sum test and signiﬁcance of Kaplan Meier (K-M) curves
were assessed by log-rank tests. All statistical tests were
considered signiﬁcant at p-value <0.05, and, if appli-
cable, adjusted to multiple test comparisons using false
discovery rate.

Results
Study cohort
The goal of this study was to rigorously compare cancer
phenotypes and lifetime risk in Brazilian adult R337H
carriers with those of adult carriers of other P/LP TP53
variants (non-R337H), either from Brazil or from other
regions of the world. R337H carriers were identiﬁed
within the BLiSS study and the comparison group was
constructed by lumping non-R337H carriers from BLiSS
with a subset of carriers with similar age range and
median age as BLISS carriers, taken from the public NCI
TP53 dataset (see Methods). Overall, we compiled data on
a total of 708 adults with P/LP variants, including 345
subjects from BLiSS registry and 363 from the NCI TP53
database (https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/), Fig. 1A. Of these 708
carriers, 303 (160 families) carried the founder R337H
variant and 405 carried non-R337H P/LP variants (172
families), including 42 Brazilian carriers (29 families)

(Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the occurrence and position of
these variants with respect to p53 domains. Aside from
R337H (303 occurrences), which is located in the oligo-
merization domain, a total of 46 different other variants
were identiﬁed, mostly located within the DNA-binding
domain. These variants included the missense variants
M133T (c.398T>C, n = 22 carriers), R175H (c.524G>A,
n = 21), R248W (c.742C>T, n = 19), G245S (c.733G>A,
n = 18), R213Q (c.638G>A, n = 16), and R273H
(c.818G>A, n = 15), as well as the silent variant T125 =
(c.375G>A, n = 19), which has been shown to inactivate
p53 by disrupting gene splicing and preventing p53
mRNA synthesis.18 This dataset represents the largest
cohort to date of adult carriers of P/LP TP53 variants,
including R337H carriers.

Cancer occurrence and patterns in R337H carriers
R337H carriers received fewer primary tumor diagnoses
compared to non-R337H Li-Fraumeni carriers (log-rank
test p-value < 0.0001, Fig. 2A; Supplementary Figure S2).
At age 50 years, 54% (164/303) of R337H carriers had at
least one cancer diagnosis, compared to 78% (316/405) of
non-R337H carriers. Noteworthy, by the age of 65, 80%
(242/303) R337H and 91% (369/405) non-R337H carriers

had at least one cancer diagnosis, respectively, suggesting
that R337H-affected individuals tended to develop can-
cers at
later ages than non-R337H carriers. Among
R337H carriers, 242 tumors were diagnosed in 162 car-
riers, while 141 carriers (46.5%) did not present with a
cancer diagnosis. The most common diagnoses were
breast cancer
(47.1%; 114/242), soft-tissue sarcoma
(15.3%; 37/242), and lung cancer (11.6%; 28/242),
comprising about 75% of all diagnoses in R337H carriers
(Fig. 2B). Among non-R337H carriers, the most frequent
diagnoses were breast cancer (33.6%; 145/432), CNS
cancer (11.1%; 48/432), and soft tissue sarcoma (8.1%;
35/432), comprising 52.8% of all tumors diagnosed in
this group, whereas 67 carriers (16.5%; 67/405) were

cancer-free. Overall, 4 cancer types were proportionally
more represented in R337H than non-R337H carriers:
breast cancer (47.1% (114/242) vs 33.6% (145/432),
Fisher’s test p-value < 0.001), soft tissue sarcoma (15.3%
(37/242) vs 8.1% (35/432), Fisher’s test p-value = 0.006),
lung cancer (11.6% (28/242) vs 5.8% (25/432), Fisher’s
test p-value = 0.01), and thyroid cancer (2.9% (7/242)
vs 0.7% (3/432), Fisher’s test p-value = 0.04).
In
contrast, CNS cancer (for details of CNS cancers, see
Supplementary Figure S1) was more represented in non-
R337H carriers (Fisher’s test p-value < 0.001), as well as
bone sarcoma (Fisher’s test p-value < 0.0001), a cancer
that represented 5.1% (22/432) of diagnoses in non-
R337H carriers but was not observed in R337H carriers

Overall,

these results show that R337H carriers
retain a high risk of cancer during adult life, albeit lower
than that of non-R337H Li-Fraumeni carriers. At age 50,

Differences between R337H male and female
carriers
Striking differences between R337H and non-R337H
carriers were even evident after stratifying by sex.
Among female R337H carriers (median age: 44 years;
Fig. 3A), 122/195 (62.6%; Fig. 2C, outer ring in yellow
represents 42.1% and orange represents 20.5%) were
least one cancer, while 200/225
diagnosed with at
(88.9%; Fig. 2C, outer ring in yellow represents 70.2%
and orange represents 18.7%) of female non-R337H
carriers (median age: 38 years; Fig. 3A) had one or
more primary tumors (Fisher’s exact test; p-value <
0.0001, Fig. 2C). For males, only 40/108 (37.0%; Fig. 2C,
outer ring in yellow represents 22.2% and orange rep-
resents 14.8%) of R337H carriers presented a cancer
diagnosis while in male non-R337H carriers, 138/180
(76.6%; Fig. 2C, outer ring in yellow represents 64.4%
and orange represents 12.2%) had at least one tumor
diagnosis (Fisher’s exact test; p-value < 0.0001). This
difference is remarkable given the median age at follow-
up, which is higher in R337H (44 years) than in non-
R337H (38 years)
(Wilcoxon test p-value < 0.05;
Fig. 2C and 3A).

To better characterize these differences, we esti-
mated the cumulative risks of developing a ﬁrst primary
cancer in R337H and non-R337H carriers stratiﬁed by
sex. Male carriers were signiﬁcantly older at ﬁrst diag-
nosis than females in both R337H (median ages: 46 and
41 years, respectively) and non-R337H groups (median
ages: 38 and 35 years, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Among
R337H carriers, both males and females showed
signiﬁcantly lower lifetime risks of developing cancer
than non-R337H counterparts (Fig. 3C). While among
non-R337H carriers, the cumulative cancer risk at 50
years was 82% for females and 72% for males, female
R337H carriers had a 2 times greater cumulative risk of

developing cancer than males at age 50 years (65% vs
30%, pairwise log-rank tests; FDR adjusted p-values:
<0.0001) (Fig. 3C).

Sex-speciﬁc differences were also noted in the tumor
spectrum (Fig. 3D). Among females, beyond the two
most common tumor types—breast cancer (49.2%, 96/
195) and soft tissue sarcomas (8.7%, 17/195)—lung
cancer (8.2%, 16/195), thyroid (2.6%, 5/195), and skin
tumors (2.0%, 4/195) were the most common diagnoses
in R337H carriers, but were proportionally rarer in non-
R337H (4% (9/225), 1.3% (3/225), and 0.9% (2/225),
respectively). Conversely, CNS cancers (9.3%, 21/225)
and colorectal cancers (4%, 9/225) were more frequent
in non-R337H than in R337H female carriers (1.5% (3/
195) and 0.5% (1/195), respectively) (Fisher test p-values
0.0005 and 0.02, respectively). Of note, two cases of
male breast cancers were detected among R337H car-
riers, compared to none in non-R337H carriers.

Next, we analyzed the temporal patterns of speciﬁc
cancer in both sexes (Fig. 3E). Both breast and lung
cancers were diagnosed at later ages in female R337H
carriers (median ages: 41 and 56.5 years) in comparison
to non-R337H (median ages: 35 and 52 years) (Wilcoxon
test p-values <0.001 and <0.05, respectively). When
considering male carriers, soft-tissue sarcomas and
stomach cancers also showed delayed occurrence in
R337H carriers (median ages: 61 and 56 years)
compared to non-R337H carriers (median ages: 40 and
35 years) (Wilcoxon test p-values <0.001 and <0.05,
respectively). In contrast, prostate tumors tended to
occur at similar median ages (>60 years) in R337H and
non-R337H male carriers.

These observations show that cancer risk patterns
differ between R337H and non-R337H adult carriers.
For both sexes, R337H carriers had a lower lifetime risk
of cancer, developing at later ages than non-R337H
carriers. Furthermore, tumor patterns in R337H, while
dominated by diagnoses typical of the LFS spectrum
(breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma) showed signiﬁcant
differences with non-R337H carriers, with a lower pro-
portion of CNS cancers and bone sarcoma and a higher
proportion of lung and prostate cancers.

Lifetime risk and trajectories of multiple cancers
We investigated the occurrence of multiple malig-
nancies in R337H carriers among 122 females and 40
males who were affected by a ﬁrst primary cancer dur-
ing adulthood. Overall, 40 females (32.8%) and 16 males
(40.0%) had more than one tumor diagnosed, respec-
tively (Supplementary Table S1). Both males and fe-
males with the R337H variant developed second tumors
at later ages than non-R337H carriers (Wilcoxon test p-
values: <0.05 and <0.01, respectively), Fig. 4A. Among
R337H carriers, females appeared to be twice as likely
than males to develop a second tumor by 50 years of age
(32% vs 16%; log-rank test, p < 0.01), Fig. 4B. No such
statistical differences could be observed among non-

R337H carriers. Among R337H carriers, males had
second primary malignancies at later ages than females
(median ages: 61 and 47 years, respectively; Wilcoxon
test p-value < 0.05), Fig. 4A. These second malignancies
were diagnosed on average 4 and 6 years after the ﬁrst
tumor
respectively
(Supplementary Figure S4).

in female and male carriers,

Breast cancer was the most frequent second diag-
nosis among female carriers of any variant, affecting
50.0% (20/40), and 64.3% (27/42) of R337H and non-
R337H carriers, respectively, Fig. 4C. Other frequent
tumors included soft-tissue sarcoma (R337H: 22.5% (9/
40), non-R337H: 11.9% (5/42)) and lung cancer
(R337H: 20.0% (8/40), non-R337H: 11.9% (5/42)).
Among male R337H carriers, the spectrum of second

malignancies comprised predominantly lung cancer
(31.2%, 5/16), soft-tissue sarcoma (25.0%, 4/16), pros-
tate (18.8%, 3/16), and kidney cancer (18.8%, 3/16). In
non-R337H male carriers, the most frequent second
tumors were CNS cancers (27.3%, 6/22), soft-tissue
sarcomas (22.7%, 5/22), and stomach cancers (18.2%,
4/22), Fig. 4D. Notably, among the R337H patients with
CNS cancer, we have four patients with glioblastoma
(GBM), three of whom have a survival rate of more than
5 years (Supplementary Table S3). This is uncommon,
given that the average survival for this tumor is 1.5 years
after diagnosis. Taken together, these results indicate
that R337H female carriers are at a noticeably higher
lifetime risk of developing multiple primary tumors and
with earlier cancer occurrence patterns.

We ﬁnally examine the sequence in which multiple
cancer may develop over adult lifetime in R337H and
non-R337H carriers (Fig. 5). In females, breast cancer
was the most frequently ﬁrst (R337H: n = 29, 72.5%;
non-R337H: n = 22, 52.4%), second (R337H: n = 17,
42.5%; non-R337H: n = 23, 54.8%), and third (R337H:
n = 4, 33.3%; non-R337H: n = 5, 50.0%) diagnosis, not
only in patients who presented with ﬁrst diagnosis of
breast cancer but also in patients with any other ﬁrst
malignancy (Fig. 5A). Notably, of the 17 R337H patients
presenting with a second breast cancer, 12 (70.6%)
exhibited contralateral breast cancers (Supplementary
Table S4), underscoring the importance of continued
bilateral breast screening even after an initial breast
cancer diagnosis in these patients. We lack this speciﬁc
information for the full non-R337H cohort. Besides
breast cancer, female R337H carriers (40 in total) ten-
ded to develop lung (15.0%, n = 6), soft-tissue sarcoma
(10.0%, n = 4), and thyroid cancer (7.5%, n = 3) as their
most common second diagnoses. Among males (16 in
total), the most frequent second diagnoses in R337H
carriers were lung cancer (31%, n = 5), kidney cancer
(19%, n = 3), and soft-tissue sarcoma (12%, n = 2),
whereas prostate cancer was the most common third
in
diagnosis

In contrast,

(50%, 2/4)

(Fig. 5B).

non-R337H male carriers (22 in total),
the most
frequent second diagnoses were soft-tissue sarcoma
(23%, n = 5), CNS cancer (23%, n = 5), and gastric
cancer (14%, n = 3).

Overall, these observations support that R337H car-
riers have a signiﬁcant lifetime risk of multiple cancers,
with patterns of occurrence that differ from those of
non-R337H carriers. Lung cancer,
in particular,
appeared to be a common second diagnosis in both
male (31%, 5/16) and female (15%, 6/40) R337H car-
riers (compared to 9% (2/22) and 7% (3/42), respec-
tively, in non-R337H carriers).

Finally, we produced a comprehensive summary of
the tumor spectrum and cumulative cancer risks in
adult R337H carriers, stratiﬁed by sex and age (Fig. 6).
For male R337H carriers, soft tissue sarcomas were the
most common ﬁrst tumor (30.0%, 12/40), followed by
prostate cancer (12%, 5/40) and lung cancer (10.0%, 4/
40). For female R337H carriers, breast cancer was
overwhelmingly the most frequent ﬁrst tumor (75.4%,
92/122), followed by soft tissue sarcomas (9.0%, 11/122)
and lung cancer (8.2%, 10/122). Regarding second tu-
mors (Fig. 6A, outer pie charts), women with primary
breast cancer often developed a second breast cancer
(15.2% (14/92); Fig. 6A, outer pie chart). For patients

proportion of carriers (shown in gray) did not develop a
second malignancy within the follow-up period (<5
years or >5 years), while others died after the ﬁrst tumor
(labeled as “D”). In terms of cumulative cancer risks, by
age 60, male R337H carriers exhibited a 47% risk of
developing a ﬁrst
tissue sarcomas
tumor, with soft
(30%), prostate cancer (12%), and lung cancer (10%)
being most prevalent (Fig. 6B). In contrast, female car-
riers showed a markedly higher cumulative risk of 87%
by age 60, dominated by breast cancer (75%), followed
by soft tissue sarcomas (9%) and lung cancer (8%). The
risk of developing a second tumor also differed between
sexes. By age 65, males showed a 45% cumulative risk,
primarily composed of lung (31%), kidney (19%), and
tissue (12%) cancers. Females demonstrated a
soft
higher second tumor risk of 88%, with breast (42%),
lung (15%), and soft tissue (10%) cancers being most
common. These ﬁndings highlight the sex-speciﬁc dif-
ferences in cancer risks and patterns among R337H
carriers, emphasizing the need for tailored screening
and management strategies.

Discussion
This study is the ﬁrst systematic and comparative anal-
ysis of the risk and patterns of cancer in adult carriers of
the TP53 R337H Brazilian founder allele versus carriers
of other P/LP TP53 variants. It compiles and employs
the largest database of adult carriers assembled to date,
including 303 Brazilian R337H carriers from 160 fam-
ilies, compared with 42 carriers of non-R337H P/LP
variants from 29 Brazilian families and 363 carriers of
P/LP variants from 172 non-Brazilian families of mostly
Caucasian background (see Methods). Results show that
adult carriers of R337H allele have a lifetime pattern of
risk that matches the Li-Fraumeni spectrum, charac-
terized by excess risk of breast cancer in females and
tissue sarcoma in both sexes. However, when
soft
compared to other P/LP variants, risk patterns in R337H
carriers only partially recapitulates the LFS spectrum.
Previous studies have provided valuable insights into
the tumor spectrum of R337H carriers8,16; however,
these investigations were predominantly focused on
pediatric populations, speciﬁc tumor types, or were
constrained by small sample sizes and limited co-
horts.14,15,17 Our study addresses critical gaps by exam-
ining the largest Brazilian cohort to date, focusing on
adulthood, and providing comprehensive analyses of
lifetime cancer risk, temporal tumor trends, sex differ-
ences, and the risk of multiple primary tumors in
R337H carriers.

The main traits that characterize adult R337 carriers
versus other variants carriers (summarized in Fig. 6A)
are: (1) low prevalence, if not absence, of typical LFS
tumors such as CNS cancers and osteosarcomas; (2)
high prevalence of some cancers not considered as
thyroid
typical of

the LFS spectrum (renal cancer,

cancers); (3) frequent occurrence of lung and prostate
cancers, in particular as second diagnoses in males; and
(4) strong sex-related difference in lifetime risk, females
having a risk almost twice higher than males. Thus, our
ﬁndings collectively demonstrate that the cancer risk
is complex and
associated with the R337H variant
multifaceted. Curiously, another variant, P152L, also
exhibits a non-typical LFS cancer proﬁle,20 with lower
age-related risks for all non-adrenal tumors compared to
other LFS patients (particularly those with mutations in
codons 245 and 248).
Interestingly, while R337H
retains a high risk of breast cancer, P152L is notable
for its absence of breast cancer cases. These variations
in cancer patterns among different TP53 variants
underscore the complexity of genotype–phenotype cor-
relations in LFS and highlight the importance of variant-
speciﬁc risk assessments. Given the high population
prevalence of R337H, our results will raise awareness of
cancer risk in this adult population and will help in
designing appropriate strategies for carrier surveillance
and early diagnosis (Fig. 6B). However, it is important to
acknowledge that our results may include a bias towards
cancer cases. This ascertainment bias could potentially
lead to an overestimation of cancer risk, particularly
identiﬁed through
when compared to individuals
population-based R337H screening programs. Thus,
clinicians should interpret our risk estimates cautiously
when counseling individuals identiﬁed as R337H car-
riers through population screening, keeping in mind
that these individuals may have a lower cancer risk than
suggested by our cohort data.

Any study of the variables that inﬂuence a genetic
predisposition to develop cancer must take into account
and explore those variables that impact the phenotypes
of that cancer. Clearly, different TP53 variant alleles can
inﬂuence cancer phenotypes as a consequence of their
structural and functional impact on the p53 protein. In
particular, TP53 variants occurring in different domains
of the p53 protein may exert tissue speciﬁc effects. For
example, somatic mutations in the p53 proline domain
most often occur in skin cancers,21 suggesting enhanced
effects of such variants in skin cells. The R337H variant
is atypical among LFS predisposing variants in its
location in the p53 protein structure (tetramerization
domain, whereas 80% of missense LFS variants fall in
the DNA-binding domain) and its biochemical charac-
teristics (uniquely sensitive to pH, enabling normal p53
oligomer assembly at neutral cell pH but preventing it at
slightly elevated pH).22 In vitro studies and mouse
models have shown that the p.R337H protein can retain
at least a degree of wild-type p53 transcriptional activ-
ities.23 Based on these observations, the R337H variant
has been qualiﬁed as hypomorphic, potentially causing
an attenuated phenotype compared to common P/LP
variants. However, the present study suggests that this
suspected hypomorphic effect does not equally affect
LFS features at all ages and in all tissues of R337H

carriers. Additionally, it is important to note that our
non-R337H comparison group includes both Brazilian
carriers and carriers from diverse geographic areas as
reported in the NCI TP53 database. This composition
provides a broad representation of TP53 variants but
also introduces potential variability in genetic back-
grounds, environmental exposures, and healthcare
practices. While this diversity strengthens the general-
izability of our ﬁndings regarding the distinct charac-
teristics of R337H carriers, it also necessitates caution in
interpreting direct comparisons between the R337H and
non-R337H groups. Future studies focusing on region-
speciﬁc comparisons may provide additional insights
into the unique features of the R337H variant in the
Brazilian population.

An analysis of the cumulative risk of developing
cancer at age 50 years (R337H = 54% vs non-
R337H = 78%, p= < 0.0001) demonstrates that over the
ﬁrst 50 years of life, R337H carries a lower risk than
other P/LP, but by age 65 years, these percentages are of
78% vs 81%, respectively, indicating that the rates of
cancer occurrence strongly increases from 50 to 65 years
of age in R337H carriers. Cancer patterns in this age
group include postmenopausal breast cancer, sarcomas
(in particular leiomyosarcoma) as well as lung or pros-
tate cancers. Thus age appears to be an important vari-
able, with different TP53 alleles having different rates of
cancer development as a function of age. Such selective
effect of age on cancer risk has also been observed in
children and adolescent carriers of R337H, who
frequently develop adrenal cortical carcinoma but show
much fewer osteogenic sarcomas, choroid plexus pap-
illoma/carcinomas, rhabdomyosarcomas or medullo-
blastomas than carriers of other P/LP variants.8,24 These
observations clearly stress that the effect of the R337H
variant is far from uniform across tissues and age and
suggest that the risk of developing a particular cancer
with different mutant TP53 alleles is largely tissue
speciﬁc. Indeed, the levels of p53 activity required to
suppress cancer may differ from one tissue (or cell type)
to another. Thus, a relatively modest attenuation of p53
activity caused by the R337H variant may be sufﬁcient to
a high risk of cancer in some tissues (breast, connective
tissues) but not in others (bone, for example). The rea-
sons underlying these cell or tissue differences in the
sensitivity to p53 activity dosage are far from being
understood.

Among other factors that may inﬂuence phenotypic
variations in cancer predisposition, the genetic ancestry
of the patient and the chromosomal context surround-
ing the speciﬁc variant allele, play an essential role. In
the case of TP53, this notion has been experimentally
addressed by comparing tumor patterns in mice from
seven different inbred strains, each having the same
R172H trp53 mutant allele (mouse counterpart of hu-
man R175H) in the heterozygous form. This study un-
covered signiﬁcant differences in penetrance, age of

onset and tissue type of tumors across different inbred
strains, suggesting that the genetic ancestry or back-
ground had a clear inﬂuence on these phenotypes.25 In
the case of the Brazilian R337H allele,
the genetic
founder effect began several hundred years ago and
expanded over several centuries of population growth in
Southern Brazil, resulting in a population in which
about one in three hundred individuals nowadays carry
a heterozygous R337H variant on a Lusitanian/Hispanic
haplotype of European background.9,26,27 There is indeed
evidence that the majority of Brazilian R337H carriers
are of Lusitanian origin.26 Nevertheless, since the pop-
ulation of Southern Brazil is composed of successive
waves of migration from Europe, Asia and Africa over a
background of native Amerindian populations, the ge-
nomes of these carriers are likely to reﬂect these in-
ﬂuences, which is an uncontrolled variable in the
population under study. This genetic diversity may
represent an important variable to explain why a pro-
portion of R337H carriers may develop cancer only as
adults or even remain cancer-free over their entire
lifespan.

Sex is part of the genetic makeup of an individual
and this study clearly shows that the sex of the patient is
in itself a risk factor, with R337H females having a
signiﬁcantly higher risk of developing cancers (65%)
than their male counterparts (30%) early in life. Unlike
spontaneous cancers where males have a higher inci-
dence of cancers, in LFS TP53 mutant carriers, females
have a higher incidence of cancers at earlier ages than
males. This is largely due to the fact that breast tumors
are the most common tumor in LFS, independent of the
mutant allele. On the other hand males with R337H
alleles develop more soft tissue sarcomas, at all ages,
than their females counterparts.

In conjunction to the factors discussed above, mul-
tiple other factors may modulate the phenotypes caused
by a genetic predisposition. The environment, through
its genetic and epigenetic effects, may impact individual
risk trajectories in relation with age and cumulative
exposure to exogenous risk factors. Immunological
response to the tumor and to the variant itself may also
be an important factor in determining the lifetime risk.28
There are also certainly stochastic events occurring over
a lifetime that may contribute to the outcomes of a ge-
netic predisposition to cancer.25 Finally, studies have
shown that certain XAF1 polymorphisms may inﬂuence
the age of cancer onset and overall cancer risk in TP53
R337H carriers.29,30 This gene–gene interaction suggests
that genomic variations in XAF1 may act as ancestry-
speciﬁc modiﬁers, potentially explaining some of the
variability in cancer manifestation observed among
R337H carriers. However, the functional relationship
between XAF1 variants and the R337H mutation is not
yet fully understood. Further research into this rela-
tionship could provide valuable insights into the mo-
lecular mechanisms underlying cancer development in

R337H carriers. Understanding the relative importance
of these factors, and their interactions, in determining
individual cancer risk, is the focus of molecular epide-
miology and is a daunting task in human populations
where all these variables can show tremendous varia-
tions. A unique genetic predisposition context associ-
ated with a founder allele such as R337H may provide
an unprecedented setup to further dissect these in-
ﬂuences and to better understand the genetic program
that leads to the formation of a tumor, its tissue speci-
ﬁcity, age of onset, sex, and projected outcomes. Such
studies will considerably contribute to a better under-
standing of the properties that enable stem cells to
evolve towards early cancer in a p53-haploid functional
or haplo-insufﬁcient environment, and to the mecha-
nisms that underlie the continuous occurrence of such
cancers over a lifetime.

Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that the cancer risk
proﬁle of R337H carriers differs from that of individuals
with other pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variants,
potentially warranting modiﬁcations to existing surveil-
lance protocols. While the core elements of LFS sur-
veillance remain crucial, such as breast cancer screening
for women and whole-body MRI for soft tissue sarcoma
detection, some adjustments may be considered. The
high prevalence of lung cancer in both sexes (10% in
males, 8% in females) suggests that incorporating lung-
speciﬁc screening, might be beneﬁcial, particularly for
individuals over 45. For male R337H carriers, enhanced
prostate cancer screening may be warranted given its
prevalence (12% of ﬁrst tumors). The signiﬁcant in-
crease in cancer risk between ages 45 and 60 indicates
that surveillance should be particularly intensive during
this period. Moreover, the high cumulative risk of sec-
ond tumors (45% in males and 88% in females by age
65) underscores
continued vigilant
the need for
screening after a ﬁrst cancer diagnosis. Importantly, the
higher overall cancer risk in female R337H carriers
(87% vs 47% at age 60 for ﬁrst tumor) may justify a
more intensive surveillance approach for women.
Although many R337H families meet attenuated LFS
criteria, there are some R337H families that meet classic
LFS criteria. Other environmental and genetic modiﬁers
may play a role in these cases. For this reason, Brazilian
surveillance protocol modiﬁcations should take into ac-
count not only the R337H status but also family
phenotype. We believe that a combination of genotype
and phenotype should guide surveillance. Finally, while
these proposed modiﬁcations aim to tailor surveillance
to the speciﬁc risk proﬁle of R337H carriers, it is crucial
to emphasize that any changes to established protocols
should be carefully evaluated through prospective clin-
ical studies before widespread implementation.

In terms of limitations and future directions, while
our study provides valuable insights into the cancer risk
proﬁles of R337H carriers, we acknowledge several
limitations in our current data that warrant further

investigation. Firstly, our study does not address the
potential impact of the R337H variant on treatment
outcomes. The response to various cancer therapies,
including chemotherapy and targeted treatments, may
differ between R337H carriers and those with other
TP53 variants. This is a critical area for future research,
as it could inform personalized treatment strategies for
these patients. Secondly, we did not have data on the use
of radiation therapy in our cohort. Given the known
sensitivity of TP53 mutation carriers to ionizing radia-
tion, understanding how radiation therapy might alter
the clinical course in R337H carriers compared to other
TP53 variant carriers is crucial. Future studies should
aim to collect detailed treatment data and long-term
follow-up to assess the impact of radiation therapy on
both tumor control and the risk of second malignancies.
Thirdly, our study was not designed to detect potential
differences in treatment response or prognosis between
different TP53 variants. Such differences, if they exist,
could have signiﬁcant implications for clinical man-
agement. Larger, prospective studies with standardized
treatment protocols and long-term follow-up will be
necessary to elucidate these potential variant-speciﬁc
effects. Lastly, while we applied speciﬁc criteria to
distinguish between second primary breast cancers and
the accuracy of this classiﬁcation may be
relapses,
limited by the available clinical and pathological data.
More advanced molecular techniques, such as compre-
hensive genomic proﬁling, could provide more deﬁni-
tive classiﬁcation in future studies.

Finally, we believe that our comprehensive analysis
of cancer patterns in carriers of
the R337H TP53
founder variant will help doctors, genetic counselors,
patients and families to elaborate appropriate strategies
for increasing awareness,
informing and providing
adequate early detection measures to the thousands of
adult carriers who are at risk in the Brazilian population.
