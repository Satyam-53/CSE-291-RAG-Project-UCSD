Reprogramming of amino acid metabolism, sustained by oncogenic signaling,
is crucial for cancer cell survival under nutrient limitation. Here we discovered
that missense mutant p53 oncoproteins stimulate de novo serine/glycine
synthesis and essential amino acids intake, promoting breast cancer growth.
Mechanistically, mutant p53, unlike the wild-type counterpart, induces the
expression of serine-synthesis-pathway enzymes and L-type amino acid
transporter 1 (LAT1)/CD98 heavy chain heterodimer. This effect is exacerbated
by amino acid shortage, representing a mutant p53-dependent metabolic
adaptive response. When cells suffer amino acids scarcity, mutant p53 protein
is stabilized and induces metabolic alterations and an amino acid transcrip-
tional program that sustain cancer cell proliferation. In patient-derived tumor
organoids, pharmacological targeting of either serine-synthesis-pathway and
LAT1-mediated transport synergizes with amino acid shortage in blunting
mutant p53-dependent growth. These ﬁndings reveal vulnerabilities poten-
tially exploitable for tackling breast tumors bearing missense TP53 mutations.

During tumor growth, cancer cells undergo extensive metabolic
rewiring in response to environmental cues and to speciﬁc biosyn-
thetic and energetic requirements1,2. Tissue-speciﬁc constraints and
the presence of a rigid, poorly perfused ﬁbrotic stroma may limit
nutrient supply to the expanding tumor mass3–6. Reprogramming of
metabolic transcriptional networks downstream to oncogenic

pathways supports tumor cell adaptation to nutrient ﬂuctuations and
other harsh conditions, thus deﬁning metabolic dependencies1,2,7.
Within the tumor ecosystem, cancer cells display the highest avidity
for amino acids (AAs) and exhibit metabolic addiction to import
and/or de novo synthesis of these nutrients8–10. AAs constitute major
precursors of all biomass components including nucleotides, proteins,

and lipids, and represent essential substrates for energy production,
antioxidant defense and signal transduction9,11. AAs are key to tumor
growth and survival in face of cancer cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stress
conditions, in particular nutrient scarcity8. Indeed, dietary or phar-
macological interventions targeting AA metabolism were shown to
dampen tumor growth and metastasis and to increase the efﬁcacy of
chemotherapies5,12–17.

TP53 is the top mutated gene in human cancers and the p53
protein acts as a master transcription factor sensing cancer-related
stress stimuli and nutrient alterations, coordinating multiple tumor
including control of metabolism18–20. TP53
suppressor activities,
mutations are mostly missense, and the resulting mutant p53 proteins
(hereafter mutp53) are sensitive to tumor-inherent stress21, being sta-
bilized and activated downstream to mechanical cues generated by
stromal stiffness22. Remarkably, beside losing wild-type tumor sup-
pressor activities, mutp53 can acquire oncogenic properties that
support tumor growth, metastatic propensity and therapy resistance,
transcriptome, proteome, and
by reprogramming cancer cell
metabolome23,24. Mutp53 was shown to exert a wide-ranging control
over tumor cell metabolism, by affecting the expression and activity of
several enzymes and transporters that control glucose and mevalonate
metabolism, thereby improving cancer cell ﬁtness and reshaping the
tumor ecosystem with aggressive outcomes25–28. In this scenario, while
a role of wild-type p53 (wtp53) on regulating some aspects of AA
metabolism has been demonstrated, no evidence of a pro-oncogenic
impact of mutp53 on this metabolic branch has been described so far.
Here we found that in breast cancer (BC) mutp53 responds to AA
scarcity and controls a metabolic transcriptional program potentiating
serine-glycine-one-carbon (SGOC) metabolism and intake of essential
AAs (EAAs), supporting BC growth and survival in nutrient-limiting
contexts. Remarkably, this metabolic branch is also sensitive to
mechanical inputs in mutp53-expressing cancers. We provide evidence
in BC and patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) that interfering
with this circuit may represent an effective and speciﬁc strategy to
blunt the growth of mutp53 expressing tumors.

Results
Mutant p53 promotes serine and glycine synthesis and intake of
essential AAs in BC cells
To investigate whether mutp53 may impact de novo AAs synthesis, we
performed a metabolic tracing experiment in the BC cell line MDA-MB-
231 (expressing p53R280K) upon p53 silencing, using uniformly
labeled [U-13C6]-Glucose. We detected a signiﬁcant reduction in the
incorporation of labeled glucose-derived carbon units into serine and
glycine in p53-silenced as compared to control cells, while no altera-
tions were found for other AAs (Fig. 1a) or glycolytic and tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (Suppl. Fig. 1a).

De novo Ser/Gly synthesis in MDA-MB-231 cells is relatively
low13,29,30, thus we repeated [U-13C6]-Glucose tracing upon removal of
to activate this biosynthetic
Ser/Gly from the medium (-S/G)
pathway31,32. Silencing of mutp53 prevented the induction of de novo
synthesis of both AAs caused by growth in -S/G conditions
(Suppl. Fig. 1b).

To investigate the mechanism underlying the effect of mutp53 on
Ser/Gly biosynthesis, we performed RNA-seq in MDA-MB-231 cells
upon p53 silencing. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a signiﬁcant
down-regulation of enzymes belonging to SGOC metabolism upon
in particular phosphoserine aminotransferase 1
mutp53 silencing,
(PSAT1)
serine synthesis) and serine hydro-
xymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) (responsible for glycine synthesis)
(Fig. 1b). We also found a signiﬁcant down-regulation of several AA
transporters belonging to SLC1 and SLC7 families, in particular SLC7A5
and SLC3A2 (coding for the LAT1/CD98hc heterodimer, a transporter
of EAAs as leucine, valine, methionine, and others), and SLC1A5 (coding
for ASCT2, transporter of neutral AAs as glutamine, alanine, serine, and

(responsible for

reduced

phosphatase

(PSPH), were

others33,34) (Fig. 1b). This analysis was conﬁrmed at both mRNA and
protein level in several BC cell lines harboring different missense
mutp53 variants (MDA-MB-231p53R280K; MDA-MB-468p53R273H; SUM-
149PTp53M237I) (Fig. 1c, d). Notably, all serine synthesis pathway (SSP)
i.e., phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), PSAT1,
enzymes,
phosphoserine
upon
mutp53 silencing in both BC cells with low (MDA-MB-231)13,29,30 and
high (MDA-MB-468; SUM-149PT)29,30,35 serine synthesis capability
(Fig. 1c). Moreover, ectopic expression of different doxycycline-
inducible mutp53 variants (R175H, R273H, R249S, and R280K) in p53-
null mouse BC 4T1 cells signiﬁcantly induced the expression of SSP,
SLC7A5, and SLC3A2 genes (Suppl. Fig. 1c). Previous work uncovered
that wtp53 regulates AA metabolism enzymes and transporters,
directly or through its target p2118. In colon cancer cells, wtp53 was
shown to redirect serine usage within one-carbon metabolism while
leaving the SSP unaltered, thus supporting cancer cells proliferation, a
function also retained by the speciﬁc missense mutp53 variant
R248W31,36. To investigate whether in BC cells wtp53 might impact Ser/
Gly synthesis, we performed a metabolic tracing experiment in the
human cell line MCF10DCIS.COM (hereafter DCIS) upon p53 silencing.
We found that, unlike mutp53, silencing of wtp53 did not perturb the
biosynthesis of Ser/Gly and of any other AAs, nor of glycolytic and TCA
cycle intermediates (Suppl. Fig. 1d, e). Moreover, neither silencing of
wtp53 in MCF7 or DCIS cells, nor its ectopic expression in 4T1 cells had
signiﬁcant effects on the expression of SSP, SLC7A5, and SLC3A2 genes
(Suppl. Fig. 1f, g), suggesting that the metabolic features here descri-
bed are speciﬁc of mutp53 proteins.

LAT1 (SLC7A5), in complex with CD98hc (SLC3A2), constitutes a
heterodimeric antiporter mediating the inﬂux of EAAs, including
branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and aromatic AAs,
in exchange for
intracellular non-essential AAs (NEAAs), mainly glutamine, which is
instead imported by ASCT233,34,37–39. Given that mutp53 controls the
expression of all three AA transporters, we analyzed whether its
silencing impacts the uptake of LAT1 substrates. Metabolic tracing
analysis with [U-13C6]-Leucine, a BCAA, revealed that mutp53 knock-
down reduced the uptake of leucine to the same level as the LAT1-
speciﬁc inhibitor JPH20340 (Fig. 1e).

mTORC1 is a key sensor of AA abundance and activates several
downstream targets (e.g., S6RP ribosomal protein S6) leading to pro-
tein synthesis and cell growth. Conversely, when AA levels are low,
mTORC1 becomes inactive, slowing protein synthesis and promoting
autophagy41,42. Consistently with the observation that mutp53 knock-
down impairs EAAs intake and AAs synthesis, we detected a signiﬁcant
reduction in phosphorylated S6RP and a concomitant increase of the
autophagosome marker LC3-II (Fig. 1f), reﬂecting mTORC1-dependent
switch from anabolic to catabolic pathways. We next asked whether
mutp53 may directly regulate the above-identiﬁed genes encoding for
SGOC enzymes and AA transporters. Inspection of a mutp53 ChIP-seq
performed in BC cells, available in the public resource ReMap 202243,
highlighted that all AA metabolism genes, whose expression was
inﬂuenced by mutp53 in RNAseq, displayed mutp53 binding peaks
within gene regions upstream to TSS that are characterized by active
promoter histone marks (Suppl. Fig. 2a and Suppl. Table 1). Given that
mutp53 often binds DNA through interactions with speciﬁc tran-
scription factors (TFs), we examined the TFs co-occuring in the same
regions as the mutp53 ChIP-seq peaks for PSAT1, SLC7A5 and SLC3A2.
We identiﬁed 10 putative TFs, including MYC/MAX, which has been
reported to transcriptionally regulate several AAs-related genes and to
interact with mutp53 in cancer (Suppl. Table 1)44. By ChIP experiments
in MDA-MB-231 cells we then conﬁrmed that mutp53 associates to
PSAT1, SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 gene promoters in a MYC-dependent way
(Suppl. Fig. 2b). Moreover, we observed that the upregulation of
PSAT1, SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 promoted by expressing doxycycline-
inducible mutp53 in DCIS cells was dampened upon silencing of MYC
(Suppl. Fig. 2c). This evidence indicates that MYC is required for

Altogether, these results demonstrate that in BC cells missense
mutp53, but not wtp53, regulates the expression of SSP enzymes
promoting Ser/Gly synthesis and transporters linked to the intake of
EAAs (Fig. 1g).

administration, led to a signiﬁcant increase in tumor volume along with
enhanced expression of all SSP enzymes and transporters of EAAs and
glutamine (SLC7A5, SLC3A2, and SLC1A5), and upregulation of
mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, a similar experiment performed with
4T1 cells bearing doxycycline-inducible wtp53 led to reduction in tumor
volume upon wtp53 induction, while no signiﬁcant variation of the
expression of SSP enzymes and AA transporters was detected,
except for a slight increase of SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 mRNA levels (Suppl.
Fig. 3a, b). These observations were conﬁrmed in a panel of invasive
ductal BCs (n = 10), stratiﬁed according to p53 protein levels and clas-
siﬁed as either p53-high cases (considered as a marker of missense p53
mutations in the diagnostic practice) or p53-low cases45,46. As shown in
Fig. 2d, expression of PSAT1, LAT1, CD98hc and the mTORC1 target
4EBP1 pT37-46 was consistently higher in p53-high cases, with LAT1 being
almost undetectable in p53-low cases. Furthermore, we investigated a
panel of 701 primary BCs (Metabric dataset), stratiﬁed for TP53 status
(wt or missense mutations). These analyses revealed that BCs harboring
missense mutp53 exhibited signiﬁcantly higher expression of SSP genes
(PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH), AA transporter genes (SLC7A5, SLC3A2,
SLC1A5) and activation of mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 2e). Similar results
were obtained by analyzing the TCGA BC dataset (Suppl. Fig. 3c).

To investigate the association of mutp53 with AA genes expres-
sion also in a non-tumoral setting, we employed a pre-neoplastic
mouse model bearing the R172H hotspot missense mutation (equiva-
lent to the human R175H). Cells from normal mammary glands of 8-
week-old p53+/+ and p53R172H/R172H mice were subjected to single-cell
RNAseq. 15 distinct cell populations belonging to 3 main groups, i.e.,
epithelial, immune, and stromal cells, were identiﬁed (Suppl. Fig. 3d),
and mutp53-expressing mammary gland displayed a reduced percen-
tage of B cells and T cells and increased percentage of ﬁbroblasts and
basal cells (Suppl. Table 2, 3). Focusing on the epithelial population,
which includes luminal cells, luminal progenitor cells, luminal differ-
entiated cells and basal cells, functional enrichment analysis of dif-
ferentially expressed genes revealed upregulation of metabolic
pathways related to glucose, lipids, and AAs in cells with missense p53
mutation (Suppl. Fig. 3e). Speciﬁcally, higher expression levels of
genes encoding SSP enzymes and AA transporters were observed in
cells bearing mutp53 compared to those with wtp53 (Suppl. Fig. 3f and
Suppl. Table 4). The observed variations however, although signiﬁcant,
were very small, which is not unexpected considering that, in the pre-
neoplastic breast tissue, mutp53 is not stabilized and activated47.

Altogether, these results demonstrate that missense mutp53
expression is associated with increased expression of SSP enzymes and
EAAs transporters in both mouse and human BC tissues, and with a
lesser extent, in preneoplastic breast tissues.

Mutant p53 becomes stabilized and enables BC cell proliferation
upon reduced AA availability
Cancer cells within a growing tumor mass often experience scarcity of
oxygen and nutrients, stress conditions that prelude to oncogene-

dependent rewiring of cell metabolism to preserve proliferative
potential5,48,49. We thus sought to investigate the behavior of tumor
cells expressing oncogenic missense mutp53 in response to changes in
AA availability, as compared to cells bearing wtp53. As shown in Fig. 3a,
the proliferation rate of wtp53-expressing BC cells dropped sig-
niﬁcantly upon progressive reduction of AA concentration. In contrast,
BC cells expressing mutp53 maintained a high proliferation rate even
when cultured in presence of very low AA content (5%) for 3 days. This
effect was dependent on mutp53 expression, as its silencing sig-
niﬁcantly reduced cell proliferation in low AA conditions (Fig. 3b;
Suppl. Fig. 4a). In contrast, silencing of wtp53 did not signiﬁcantly
impact proliferation under low AA (Suppl. Fig. 4b). We compared the
response of BC cells expressing either wild-type or mutp53 to AA
shortage. When grown in low AA, DCIS and 4T1 cells expressing
mutp53 variants exhibited increased proliferation, with 4T1 bearing
p53R175H and p53R280K showing an approximately 2-fold higher
replication rate as compared to those bearing empty vector or p53WT
(Suppl. Fig. 4c–e).

Cells grown as 3D spheroids recapitulate in vitro the spatial and
nutrient heterogeneity (e.g., oxygen and nutrients availability) occur-
ring within a tumor mass50. To conﬁrm our observations, we cultured
DCIS cells expressing either endogenous wtp53 alone or doxycycline-
inducible HA-tagged mutp53R280H as 3D tumor spheroids in com-
plete medium (CM) or in low AA condition. As shown in Fig. 3c and d,
DCIS spheroids expressing wtp53 exhibited a reduced replication rate
(judged by BrdU labeling in Fig. 3c) and mTORC1 activation (evaluated
by phosphorylation of its target 4EBP1) when grown in low AA. In
contrast, replication of DCIS-mutp53R280K spheroids was less affec-
ted (Fig. 3c) and sustained activation of mTORC1 was evident
(Fig. 3d, e). These results suggest that mutp53 allows cancer cells to
thrive under AA starvation, by sustaining cell proliferation along with
mTORC1 activation.

The oncogenic activity of mutp53 has been linked to its protein
stabilization22,51. Interestingly, by immunoﬂuorescence, protein levels
of ectopically expressed mutp53 appeared higher in DCIS spheroids
maintained in low AA than in those grown in CM (Fig. 3f), thus sug-
gesting that AA scarcity may inﬂuence the stabilization of mutp53.
Furthermore, in two different BC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-
468) mutp53 protein, but not its mRNA levels, increased upon pro-
gressive AA limitation, and this was accompanied by a concomitant
increase of PSAT1 levels (Fig. 3g and Suppl. Fig. 4a, f). In normal and
cancer cells, AA scarcity is sensed by the Eukaryotic Translation
Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Kinase 4 (eIF2AK4 also known as GCN2), which
phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2α), to
switch Cap-dependent/Cap-independent translation, promoting the
expression of AA biosynthetic enzymes and transporters as an adap-
tive response5,52. As shown in Fig. 3h and Suppl. Fig. 4g, in low AA, we
consistently observed a GCN2-dependent increased phosphorylation
of eIF2α, and a reduction of mutp53 protein levels upon GCN2 inhi-
bition. These data suggest that activation of AA stress response

impacts mutp53 accumulation and activation in cells exposed to low
AA concentration. Stabilization of mutp53 protein in cancer cells has
been shown to involve histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated
Hsp90 deacetylation, which protects mutp53 from murine double
minute 2 (MDM2)-dependent degradation22,53. Remarkably,
the

accumulation of mutp53 in low AA was prevented by pharmacological
inhibition of either HDAC6 (SAHA) or HSP90 (17-AAG) (Suppl. Fig. 4h).
Altogether, this evidence suggests that in cancer cells experien-
cing a reduction in AA availability, mutp53 is stabilized and in turn
supports tumor cell proliferation.

Mutant p53 rewires AA metabolism upon AA restriction
To evaluate the impact of mutp53 on the metabolic proﬁle of BC cells,
we then performed a targeted metabolomic analysis on MDA-MB-231
cells upon AA restriction and mutp53 silencing. As shown in Fig. 4, AA
restriction and mutp53 knockdown dramatically impacted the meta-
bolome. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) clearly distinguished the
four different experimental conditions (Suppl. Fig. 5a). Down-
regulation of mutp53 (Suppl. Fig. 5b) led to alterations in different
metabolic pathways when cells were grown in CM or in low AA: in
particular, mutp53 ablation resulted in changes in pathways related to
AA metabolism including Ser, Gly, Leu, Iso, Val, Met metabolism in cells
exposed to AA restriction (Suppl. Fig. 5c).

Analysis of individual metabolic intermediates highlighted 51
signiﬁcantly modulated metabolites (FDR < 0.05) (Suppl. Table 5). In
CM, silencing of mutp53 signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of Asp
(Fig. 4a, b), while other AAs were unaffected (Fig. 4a, c–h, Suppl.
Fig. 5d, e).

A different metabolic scenario emerged when mutp53 was silenced
in cells grown in low AA. Except for Gln and Glu (Suppl. Fig. 5d, e), which
increased upon mutp53 silencing, a signiﬁcant reduction was observed
for several AAs, including Asp, Phe, Met, Ile, Asn, and the overall pool of
EAAs (Fig. 4b, e–i).

In Fig. 1a we showed that silencing of mutp53 in cells grown in CM
led to decreased serine biosynthesis. However, when we assessed
serine levels by steady-state metabolomic analysis (Fig. 4d), we did not
observe relevant changes, likely due to serine intake by transporters.
Under low AA conditions, serine levels declined, and this trend was
further enhanced upon mutp53 silencing (Fig. 4d). We also evaluated
the impact of mutp53 on Ser/Gly biosynthesis by conducting glucose
tracing experiments under the aforementioned conditions. As expec-
ted, low AA availability boosts glucose-derived serine and glycine
production, an effect that was completely abolished by mutp53
downregulation (Fig. 4j).

Having demonstrated that mutp53 potentiates SGOC metabolism
and the import of EAAs via LAT1, we sought to identify which among
the products of these pathways (i.e., nucleotides, glutathione and
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)) was critical for the survival and pro-
liferation advantage conferred by mutp53 to cancer cells under AA
restriction (Fig. 1g)10,54. To this aim, we supplemented MDA-MB-231
cells, silenced for mutp53 and cultured in low AA, with either nucleo-
tides (dNTPs), SAM or N-acetylcysteine (NAC). As shown in Fig. 4k, the
addition of dNTPs completely rescued tumor cell proliferation in low
AA. Also NAC caused a slight improvement in cell proliferation rate,
although less than addition of dNTPs. Conversely, SAM administration
did not exhibit any effect on cell proliferation. Under low AA compared
to CM, the oxidative branch of PPP was upregulated as demonstrated
by higher levels of 6-phosphogluconate, ribose-5-phosphate/xylulose-
5-phosphate/ribulose-5-phosphate (three different isomers that we
measured together and from now on named ribose-5-phosphate)
(Suppl. Fig. 5f, g). On the other hand, in cells silenced for mutp53 in low
AA medium compared to control, ribose-5-phosphate levels were
decreased as well as those of NADPH (Suppl. Fig. 5g, h), a reducing
cofactor produced by the PPP oxidative phase with a key role in
maintaining redox balance. In low AA condition, we detected an

increased amount of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in cells silenced for
mutp53, likely due to the reduced levels of NADPH (Suppl. Fig. 5i).
These ﬁndings suggest that mutp53 is necessary for maintaining the
redox status of tumor cells. Accordingly, the rescue of proliferation
rate observed only with dNTPs administration in mutp53-silenced cells
under low AA conditions is likely due to the bypass of both AAs utili-
zation and the PPP oxidative phase, pathways that are suppressed
when mutp53 is silenced.

Notably, reduced nucleotide synthesis and alteration of tumor
redox balance, as well as of SGOC metabolism in general, can result in
increased DNA damage and reduced tumor growth13,17,55–57. Indeed,
cells deprived of AAs exhibited increased DNA damage that was fur-
ther enhanced upon mutp53 knockdown (Suppl. Fig. 5j).

Mutant p53 induces an AA metabolic transcriptional program in
cancer cells exposed to low AA
To unravel the mechanisms underlying mutp53-dependent metabolic
alterations, we performed RNA-seq upon mutp53 knockdown in MDA-
MB-231 cells grown in low AA. In control cells, the gene sets that were
most enriched upon AA restriction were related to the canonical
transcriptional response to AA scarcity, including metabolism of AAs
and derivatives, tRNA aminoacylation and AA transport (Fig. 5a and
Suppl. Fig. 6a). Indeed, most upregulated transcripts encode for
enzymes and transporters that fuel SGOC, including PSAT1, SLC1A4,
and CTH, and others involved in nutrient stress response, including
Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15)58 and Phosphoenolpyruvate
Carboxykinase 2 (PCK2)59,60. Interestingly, mutp53 knockdown sig-
niﬁcantly reduced the expression of all major gene sets enriched upon
AA restriction, along with a cell cycle gene set (Fig. 5a and Suppl.
Fig. 6b). The volcano plot in Fig. 5b highlights that mRNAs most
downregulated upon mutp53 silencing were those encoding for SGOC
enzymes, including PHGDH, PSAT1, MTHFD2, NNMT, and SHMT2, and
for the AA transporters SLC1A4, SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and SLC7A5. These
ﬁndings suggest that mutp53 plays a pivotal role in sustaining cancer
cells’ adaptive response to low AA conditions. Of note, this effect could
not be ascribed to a reduced activation of GCN2, as increased phos-
phorylation of eIF2α in low AA occurred irrespective of mutp53
expression (Suppl. Fig. 6c).

Intriguingly, some of the genes induced by mutp53 under low AA
were also regulated by mutp53 in complete medium, although to a
lesser extent (Fig. 1b, c and Suppl. Fig. 6i). This suggests that AA
scarcity may promote the mutp53-dependent induction of AA meta-
bolism genes that, in turn, supports survival and proliferation of can-
cer cells. Indeed, the signiﬁcant upregulation of genes encoding SSP
enzymes and SLC7A5/SLC3A2 EAAs transporter in mutp53- expressing
cells grown in low AA, was almost completely abolished upon mutp53
knockdown (Fig. 5c and Suppl. Fig. 6d, e). As expected, as a con-
sequence of the canonical AA stress response we observed increased
expression of SSP, SLC7A5/SLC3A2 genes and PSAT1, LAT1/CD98hc
protein levels upon growth in low AA also in wtp53-expressing BC cells.
This effect however was not dependent on wtp53, and wtp53 protein
levels were not affected by growth in low AA (Suppl. Fig. 6f–h). To
conﬁrm these ﬁndings, we employed 3D cultures of DCIS cells
expressing doxycycline-inducible mutp53. In this setting, we observed

signiﬁcant upregulation of SLC7A5, SLC3A2 and SSP genes in mutp53-
expressing spheroids exposed to low AA, while induction of these
genes was much more limited in samples expressing only
wtp53 (Fig. 5d).

Furthermore, under low AA conditions mutp53 upregulated some
AA metabolism genes that were either not induced or even repressed

by mutp53 itself in complete medium, i.e., CTH, and SLC1A4, while
other known mutp53 target genes (such as BUB1, CCNE2, PSMA1, PSMB1
and others) were not induced by low AA61,62 (Fig. 1b, Fig. 5b and Suppl.

of the mutp53 transcriptional repertoire. Notably, in BC patients this

associated with missense mutp53 status and correlated with poor
prognosis (Fig. 5e, f and Suppl. Fig. 6j).

In solid tumors, the presence of a rigid ﬁbrotic stroma can lead
to inefﬁcient perfusion and increased interstitial pressure, causing
ﬂuctuations in AA availability63–65. Notably, ECM stiffening also leads
to stabilization and activation of mutp5322. Therefore, we investi-
gated whether ECM-derived mechanical cues could sustain mutp53-
dependent induction of AA metabolism, particularly under AA scar-
city. To explore this, we cultured MDA-MB-231 cells on ﬁbronectin-
coated hydrogels with varying elastic moduli. As shown in Suppl.
Fig. 7a, b, ECM stiffening elevated mutp53 protein levels and resulted
in a p53-dependent increase in the expression of SLC7A5 and PSAT1.
Conversely, BC cells grown on plastic (a hyperstiff substrate) exhib-
ited reduced mutp53 protein levels and decreased transcription of
SLC7A5 and PSAT1 genes when treated with mechanosignaling inhi-
bitors that target focal adhesion signaling (e.g., FAK inhibitor
PF573228, Src family inhibitor Dasatinib)66,67 and actin polymeriza-
tion (e.g., Cytochalasin D and Latrunculin A)68 (Suppl. Fig. 7c, d).
Consistently, mutp53-bearing tumors characterized by high LAT1
and PSAT1 levels (Fig. 2d) displayed collagen ﬁbers embedding tumor
foci (Suppl. Fig. 7e).

These results led us to hypothesize that mechanosignaling could
be required for mutp53 stabilization in low AA. To further investigate
this aspect, MDA-MB-231 cells grown on plastic and exposed to low AA,
were treated with mechanosignaling inhibitors, including Dasatinib,
PF573228 or Cytochalasin D. We observed that the upregulation of
mutp53 induced by low AA was prevented by these treatments (Suppl.
Fig. 7f). Moreover, treatment with Dasatinib and PF573228 abrogated
the transcriptional activation of SLC7A5/SLC3A2 and SSP enzymes
induced by AA restriction and enhanced the inhibitory effect of low AA
on cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 5g, h).

These data suggest that, in BC cells expressing mutp53, signaling
along mechanotransduction pathways is crucial for activating a spe-
ciﬁc mutp53-dependent transcriptional program, providing a pro-
liferation/survival advantage under AA scarcity.

Inhibition of serine synthesis and EAAs intake reduces mutant
p53-dependent BC growth in vivo
To investigate the signiﬁcance of SSP and LAT1-mediated AAs trans-
port for the oncogenic function of mutp53 in BC cells, we treated MDA-
MB 468 mutp53-expressing cells cultured in low AA, with NCT503 (a
speciﬁc inhibitor of PHGDH, a key enzyme in the SSP), and JPH203 (a
LAT1 transporter inhibitor)40. Each treatment reduced cell growth in
low AA, and combined inhibition of both PHGDH and LAT1 (N/J)
showed a stronger effect (Suppl. Fig. 8a). Importantly, the prolifera-
tion/survival advantage of mutp53-expressing DCIS and 4T1 cells in
low AA was abolished by inhibition of either PHGDH, LAT1 or their
combination (Fig. 6a, b).

Furthermore, the effect of these inhibitors on mutp53-dependent
tumorigenesis was investigated in vivo. 4T1 cells expressing

doxycycline-inducible HA-tagged mutp53 variants (R175H or R280K)
or control vector were injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic
mice, and mutp53 expression was induced by doxycycline adminis-
tration. Expression of either mutp53R280K or mutp53R175H signiﬁcantly
increased tumor growth (Fig. 6c–e and Suppl. Fig. 8b). Once tumors
were palpable, mice were administered combined NCT503/JPH203
treatment or placebo. The combined treatment with serine synthesis
and LAT1 inhibitors had minimal impact on the growth of control (p53-
null) tumors, whereas it markedly reduced both the volume and weight
of tumors expressing mutp53 variants (Fig. 6d, e). Importantly, the
growth advantage conferred by mutp53 expression in vivo was com-
pletely abolished by NCT503/JPH203 treatment (Fig. 6c–e). The com-
bination treatment did not show any general toxicity as judged by
body weight evaluation (Suppl. Fig. 8c). Moreover, mutp53-expressing
tumors treated with NCT503/JPH203 exhibited increased γH2AX foci
and expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3 (Suppl.
Fig. 8d, e), suggesting that combined inhibition of serine synthesis and
LAT1-mediated AA intake may increase both DNA damage response
and cell death, thus contributing to tumor reduction.

Altogether, these results provide evidence that targeting the SSP
and LAT1 transporter, which mediates EAAs uptake, abolishes the
oncogenic function of mutp53 in vitro and inhibits tumor growth
in vivo.

Patient-derived tumor organoids expressing mutant p53 are
vulnerable to SSP/LAT1 or mechanosignaling inhibition under
AA restriction
Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) recapitulate the epithelial archi-
tecture and the spatial and nutrient heterogeneity of their tumor of
origin69. We sought to employ these ex-vivo models to conﬁrm the
ability of mutp53 to confer growth/survival advantages to cancer tis-
sues in conditions of AA scarcity, and to test potential tumor vulner-
abilities associated with this metabolic dependency. PDOs were
generated from seven tumor samples representing different BC sub-
types, with three expressing wtp53 and four harboring distinct mis-
sense TP53 mutations (Fig. 7a). These PDOs were cultured in media
with progressively reduced AAs supply (100%, 25% and 5% relative AAs
content).

We observed that PDOs expressing wtp53 displayed sig-
niﬁcantly decreased viability in low AA conditions, whereas all
mutp53-expressing PDOs were still able to proliferate (Fig. 7b), thus
reﬂecting the varied sensitivity to nutrient stress observed among
BC cells expressing different p53 variants. Accordingly, BC tissues
from which mutp53-expressing PDOs were derived, exhibited higher
levels of PSAT1 and LAT1 compared to those expressing wtp53
(Suppl. Fig. 9a).

We next evaluated the impact of inhibiting either the SSP and
EAAs transporter or mechanosignaling on the growth of PDOs upon
reduced AA availability. Strikingly, treatment with NCT503 and
JPH203, either as single agents or in combination (N/J), as well as with

PDOs (Fig. 7c, d). Importantly, these treatments did not further
decrease the viability of PDOs harboring wtp53 when cultured under
low AA conditions (Fig. 7c, d). These ﬁndings underscore that mutp53-
bearing BC PDOs exhibit a proliferative and survival advantage under
conditions of AA restriction, which represents a potential vulnerability.

Discussion
Overexpression of SGOC enzymes and EAAs transporters is frequent in
several tumors and associates with poor prognosis, making them
promising targets for cancer therapies3,35,38,70. Cancer cells have a high
demand for serine and tumors arising in tissues with low serine supply,
such as breast, gain a growth advantage through increased serine

synthesis12, which can be achieved by increasing either glycolytic
intermediates or directly promoting SSP.

In this study we found that, in BC, mutp53, but not wtp53, directly
enhances the expression of all SSP enzymes, boosting de novo serine
synthesis. This effect is more pronounced under conditions of low AA
availability, promoting BC cells proliferation. These observations
suggest that the tissue context and the type of nutritional stress can
inﬂuence mutp53-dependent adaptive responses. Mutp53 is known to
promote glucose intake26, which also feeds serine synthesis through
glycolysis. When glucose is scarce, adequate Ser/Gly production is
guaranteed by the gluconeogenic enzyme PCK271. Interestingly, we
found that mutp53 promotes the expression of PCK2, which may boost
serine production by ensuring substrates availability and shunting
carbon units from glycolysis into SSP. Furthermore, in BC, we observed
a correlation between missense mutp53 and increased expression of
the two major serine transporters ASCT1 (SLC1A4) and ASCT2 (SLC1A5),
frequently overexpressed in cancer34,72. Therefore, it is conceivable
that mutp53-bearing tumors maintain high serine levels, by increasing
both intracellular transport and synthesis of serine, thereby sustaining
proliferation and redox balance.

On the other hand, the availability of EAAs in cancer cells relies on
their efﬁcient uptake from the environment. We found that mutp53
promotes the inﬂux of EAAs, by sustaining the expression of both LAT1
transporter and of its plasma membrane anchor CD98hc. LAT1/
CD98hc acts as an antiporter mediating EAAs inﬂux principally in
exchange for glutamine, which is imported by ASCT2. Interestingly, we
observed signiﬁcantly higher expression of LAT1/CD98hc and ASCT2
in breast tissues bearing mutp53 compared to wtp53 tumors. Hence by
increasing the expression of these transporters, mutp53 could max-
imize the inﬂux of EAAs, including leucine and methionine, which are
crucial for mTORC1 activation and one-carbon metabolism.

thus

ensuring metabolic

Therefore, our results suggest that mutp53 potentiates two
interconnected branches of AA metabolism17,73,74, i.e., SSP and EAAs
intake (Suppl. Fig. 9b), which converge to fuel one-carbon cycle, a
central hub for nucleotides synthesis, redox balance and epigenetic
regulation,
adaptation to nutrient
ﬂuctuations54. Interestingly, we observed that, under low AAs avail-
ability, the GCN2-dependent AA stress response leads to the accu-
mulation of mutp53. In turn mutp53 activates a speciﬁc transcriptional
program and rewires cancer cell metabolic proﬁle, guaranteeing high
intracellular levels of AAs to provide nucleotides and antioxidant
agents, crucial for DNA synthesis, replication and repair. Indeed, under
low AAs, mutp53 supports nucleotides incorporation and limits DNA
damage, conferring a proliferative advantage to BC cells. The AA
metabolism genes controlled by mutp53 have been reported as targets
of major transcription regulators, including MYC, YAP and NRF2,
known to bind mutp5375–77 and our data suggest that mutp53 coop-
erates with MYC to induce the transcription of AA metabolism genes.
Nutrient availability in tumors is inﬂuenced by both anatomic site
and tissue architecture. For example, a tumor-constraining stiff ECM
can concomitantly contribute to nutrient limitation and promote
cancer progression by favoring metabolic reprogramming and acti-
including mutp5322,78–80. We
vating mechanosensitive oncogenes,

found that ECM mechanical cues are necessary to enable a mutp53-
dependent response to AA scarcity and that either targeting mechan-
osignaling upstream of mutp53 activation or inhibiting its downstream
AA metabolic pathways, could effectively suppress mutp53 oncogenic
activities in BC.

Dietary or pharmacological interventions aimed at interfering
with either serine or LAT1-transported AA metabolism have been
proposed to reduce tumor growth17,81. However, prior studies have
shown the inefﬁcacy of single-agent metabolic therapies, due to
emerging compensatory metabolic responses. For example, inhibition
of PHGDH (NCT503)
in osteosarcoma increased LAT1/CD98hc
expression and augmented intracellular BCAAs with consequent
mTORC1 activation and increased survival74. Similarly, BC cells resis-
tant to LAT1 inhibition (JPH203) displayed enhanced expression of
SGOC pathway genes82. Our data in BC cells, mouse models, and PDOs
demonstrate that combined administration of PHGDH and LAT1 inhi-
bitors signiﬁcantly blunts the growth advantage of mutp53-bearing
tumors, especially under AA limitation. These ﬁndings suggest that
mutp53-bearing BCs become dependent to these metabolic pathways.
Moreover, we provided a proof of concept that inhibiting mechan-
osignaling using Dasatinib, a Src family inhibitor currently in phase II
clinical trial for advanced BC83,84, could be an effective strategy to halt
the growth of mutp53-BCs under AA scarcity (Suppl. Fig. 9b).

TP53 mutations are the most common genetic lesions reported
during BC brain metastasis85,86 which relies on glutamine and BCAAs,
highly abundant in the brain, while depending on efﬁcient SSP, due to
severe depletion of serine and glycine in this tissue13,87. It is tempting to
speculate that the ability of mutp53 to promote EAAs intake and Ser/
Gly synthesis may also endow BC cells with an advantage during
colonization of secondary organs, such as the brain, where the avail-
ability of these AAs is challenging.

All in all, our study supports the notion that missense mutp53 acts
as a context-activated oncogene, favoring cancer cells adaptation to
tumor-related stresses. This implies that during all stages of tumor
evolution, tissue environmental conditions, including AAs ﬂuctuations
and stiff ECM, may act as critical selectors for mutp53-expressing
tumor cells, which display metastatic and chemo-resistant features.

Human cell lines are from ATCC or other laboratories cooperating
on the project. Cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination with
negative results.

Breast cancer organoid culture
For organoid generation, tissues were processed as described in Chen
et al., 202188. Brieﬂy, tissues were mechanically processed until small
portions (1 mm3) were obtained. Then they were enzymatically diges-
ted for 2–6 h at 37 °C with a digestion buffer containing Collagenase
type III 300 U mL−1 (Worthington) Hyaluronidase 100 U mL−1 Sigma
Aldrich in Advanced DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin,
10 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF), 5 µg/ml
recombinant human insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone 20 ng/mL).

Isolated cell clusters were resuspended in Matrigel® (Corning) and

plated in 24-well plates.

BC organoids were grown in the previously established culture
conditions89. Brieﬂy BC organoids were maintained in Matrigel and in
Ad-DM medium supplemented with 1X Glutamax, 10 mM Hepes, 1X
Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 µg/mL Primocin, 1X B27 supplement, 5 mM
Nicotinamide, 1.25mM N-Acetylcysteine, 250 ng/mL R-spondin 3, 5 nM
Heregulin β−1, 100 ng/mL Noggin, 20 ng/mL FGF-10, 5 ng/mL FGF-7,
5 ng/mL EGF, 500 nM A83-01, and 500 nM SB202190. Moreover, 5 µM
Y-27632 was added to culture media for the ﬁrst three days of culture.
When conﬂuency was reached, organoids were passaged by dis-
playing and collecting Matrigel from the wells and by incubating it for
1 h at 4 °C with Cell Recovery solution (Corning). Organoids were then
digested with TrypLE solution (Gibco) for 5 min at 37 °C. After enzyme
neutralization and washing, organoids were resuspended in Matrigel
and reseeded as above in order to allow the formation of new
organoids.

Bright-ﬁeld imaging of organoids was performed on an Olympus

CK30 microscope.

Generation of patient-derived organoids from breast cancer was
approved by institutional review board of Regina Elena National Can-
cer Institute and Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO),
National Cancer Institute and appropriate regulatory authorities
(approval no. IFO 1270/19 and IRB-06-2017 respectively). All patients
signed an informed consent.

Drug treatment of tumor organoids and viability assay
Organoids were passaged as described above and allowed to grow
for 5–7 days. Organoids were then treated and after 7 days their
viability was analyzed as previously described90. Brieﬂy, organoids
were harvested, and the smaller ones were isolated by recovering
the supernatant after gentle centrifugation (16 g, 1 min). Then, 96-
well Optiplates were coated with 20 µL of Matrigel and 20 µL of
Matrigel/cells suspension were added on top (250 organoids/ well).

Medium without N-Acetylcysteine and containing the indicated
drugs was then added. After 7 days of treatments, cell medium was
removed and 100 µL of 1:1 CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent (Promega)/
culture media per well were added to measure ATP as a proxy for
viable cells, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Lumines-
cence reading was performed in an EnSpire® multimode plate
reader (Perkin Elmer).

Spheroid formation
For spheroid formation, a semi-conﬂuent adherent culture of cells was
detached with 0.05% Trypsin at 37 °C. After the cells have detached,
the trypsin is neutralized with growth media and centrifuged. The cells
are then singularized and counted. 15 × 103 singularized cells were
plated on each well (three wells for each condition) of a 96-well ultra-
low attachment dish (Corning® Costar® Ultra-Low Attachment Multiple
Well Plate, Cat. n. CLS7007) in complete media (CM) or in 25%
AA media.

Amino acids restriction
Cells were cultivated in media with different percentages of amino
acids as indicated in ﬁgure legends. These media were obtained by
diluting the complete medium (depending on the cell line) with
medium lacking amino acids. The latter was generated by using Dul-
becco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) without amino acids and
glucose or, alternatively, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) sup-
plemented with MEM Vitamin solution 100X (1X, Thermo Fischer).
These media were then supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin,
10 μg/mL streptomycin, glucose, Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) or Horse
Serum (HS), and growth factors and recombinant proteins (if required)
to reach the same molar concentrations of the original complete
medium.

Preparation of ﬁbronectin-coated hydrogel matrix
50, 8, 4, or 0.5 kPa Easy Coat hydrogels (Cell guidance system) were
coated with 10 μg/ml ﬁbronectin.

Reagents and plasmids
The following compounds and working concentrations were used:
Fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich F0895), JPH203 (Selleck Chemi-
cals S8667), NCT503 (Sigma Aldrich SML1659), Dasatinib (Selleck
Chemicals S1021), PF-573228 (Selleck Chemicals S2013), Cytochalasin
D (Sigma Aldrich C2618), Latrunculin-A (Cayman 10010630), SAHA
17-AAG Geldanamycin (Lc Laboratories
Cayman 149647-78-9),
A-6880), GCN2-IN-1 (Synonyms: A-92; MedChem Express Cat. No.: HY-
100877), nucleosides dNTPs (Euroclone EMR276425), N-Acetyl-L-
Cysteine (NAC) (Sigma Aldrich A9165), S-(5′-Adenosyl)-L-Methionine
Iodide (SAM) (Sigma Aldrich A4377) and DMSO (Sigma Aldrich D4540).
Treatments lasted as described in ﬁgure legends.

For lentiviral production, low conﬂuence HEK-293T packaging
cells were transfected using PEI 2X (1 mg/ml) with the appropriate
plasmids in combination with the pMD2.G and ps-PAX2 packaging
vectors. After 48–72 h the viral supernatant was collected, centrifuged
5 min at 500 g, and ﬁltered with a 0.45 μm low-protein binding ﬁlter to
remove cellular debris. Then the virus-containing medium was added
to the target cells.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Cells were harvested in Qiazol lysis reagent (Qiagen) for total RNA
extraction, and contaminant DNA was removed by DNase treatment.
Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were carried out on cDNAs retro-
transcribed with iScript™ Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad 172-
5038) and analyzed with BIORAD CFX96 TouchTM detection system
and Biorad CFX Manager software. Experiments were performed at
least three times, and each sample is the average of a technical
duplicate. The quantiﬁcation is based on the 2-ΔΔCt method. Histone 3
(H3) was used as a reference gene in human cells while Rpl13a was used
for mouse cells. PCR primer sequences are the following:

anti-rabbit HRPO-conjugated (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as secondary
antibodies. Membranes were analyzed by chemiluminescence using
Pierce ECLTM Western Blotting Substrate or Pierce ECLTM Plus Western
Blotting Substrate. Unprocessed scans of blots in ﬁgures and Supple-
mentary ﬁgures are provided in the Source Data File.

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of mammalian cells
Brieﬂy, cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100
for 10 min, and blocked in 3% Fetal Bovine Serum FBS/PBS for 30 min.
Antigen recognition was done by incubation with primary antibody at
4 °C for 14 h and with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 568 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, Life Technologies) at
4 °C for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Life Technologies,
33342) or Dapi (Sigma Aldrich, 32670-F) for 15 min.

For immunoﬂuorescence of MCF10DCIS.COM spheroids, they
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed twice in PBS,
permeabilized, and blocked in 0.5% Triton X-100/5% Horse Serum
(HS)/PBS 14 h at 4 °C. The following day, antigen recognition was
performed by incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C for 14 h on a
rotating wheel and secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor
568, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 647, Life
Technologies) at room temperature for 2 h. Nuclei were stained with
Dapi (Sigma Aldrich, 32670-F) for 15 min.

Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC)
For IHC, human samples were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin and
parafﬁn-embedded. 4 mm-tissue sections were deparafﬁnized and
rehydrated. Novocastra Epitope Retrieval Solution (pH6 or pH9) was
used to unmask antigens in a thermostatic bath at 98 °C for 30 min.
Subsequently, the sections were brought to room temperature and
washed in PBS. After neutralizing the endogenous peroxidases with 3%
H2O2 and Fcblocking by 0.4% casein in PBS (Novocastra), the sections
were incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min at room tempera-
ture. The immunostaining was revealed by a polymer detection
method (Novolink Polymer Detection Systems Novocastra Leica Bio-
systems Newcastle Ltd Product No: RE7280-K) and 3,3’-diamino-
benzidine (DAB) substrate-chromogen. Slides were analyzed under a
Zeiss Axioscope A1 microscope and microphotographs were collected
using a Zeiss Axiocam 503 Color digital camera with the Zen 2.0
Software (Zeiss). Slide digitalization was performed using an Aperio
CS2 digital scanner (Leica Biosystems) with the ImageScope software
(Aperio ImageScope version 12.3.2.8013, Leica Biosystems). Quantita-
tive analyses of IHC stainings were performed by calculating the
average percentage of positive signals in ﬁve nonoverlapping ﬁelds at
medium-power magniﬁcation (X200) using Nuclear Hub or Positive
Pixel Count v9 ImageScope software.

RNA-seq from MDA-MB-231 cell line
Two different RNA-seq experiments were performed in this work.

In ﬁrst RNA-seq (Fig. 1b) MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with
siCTL or sip53 for 48 h. In the second RNA-seq (Fig. 5 and Suppl. Fig. 6)
MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in complete medium (100% AAs) or in
low AA medium (25% AAs) and transfected with siCTL or sip53 for 72 h.
For total RNA extraction from the cells, the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen,
74104) was used with contaminant DNase treatment (RNase-Free
DNase set, Qiagen, 79254).

mRNA libraries were obtained by the Illumina TruSeq stranded
mRNA library construction kit. mRNA libraries were sequenced using
Illumina Novaseq 6000 for 100 bp paired-end sequencing (60 M reads).

Analysis of RNA-seq data from MDA-MB-231 cell line
Read quality was veriﬁed using fast QC (version 0.11.3; http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Raw reads were

trimmed for adapters, polyA read-through, and low-quality tails
(quality <Q20) using BBDuk (version 37.02; sourceforge.net/pro-
jects/bbmap/). Reads shorter than 35 bp were also removed resulting
on average 51 M trimmed reads per sample. Reads were subsequently
aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using STAR (version
2.7.3a91); with default parameters. Raw gene counts were obtained
using the featureCounts function of the Rsubread R package (version
2.0.192); and the Gencode gene annotation for hg38 genome. Gene
counts of the ﬁrst RNA-seq (Fig. 1b) were normalized to counts per
million mapped reads (cpm) using the edgeR package (version
3.28.193); only genes with a CPM greater than 1 in at least 2 samples
were further retained for differential analysis Gene counts of second
RNA-seq (Fig. 5 and Suppl. Fig. 6) were normalized to z-scores sub-
tracting the mean expression across samples and dividing it for the
standard deviation of each single gene. Differential gene expression
analysis was performed using the DESeq function of the DESeq2
package (version 1.3694);. Over-representation analysis was per-
formed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and gene sets of the
KEGG and Reactome collections from the Broad Institute Molecular
Signatures
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/
msigdb). GSEA software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.
jsp) was applied on expression data of cells transfected with mutant-
p53 or with a control vector. Gene sets were considered signiﬁcantly
enriched at FDR < 5% when using Signal2Noise as a metric and 1,000
permutations of gene sets. Gene expression heatmap of Fig. 1b has
been generated calculating the log2 of cpm expression values and
after row-wise standardization. Gene expression heatmap of Suppl.
Fig. 6i has been generated using z-scores expression values. All
analyses were performed using R 4.2.1 and publicly available packa-
ges explicitly cited in the manuscript. No custom functions were
written for the analysis.

Database

Gene expression datasets
Gene expression data (raw counts), TP53 mutations, and clinical infor-
mation of the TCGA breast cancer dataset (TCGA-BRCA) were down-
loaded from the Genomic Data Commons Portal using functions of the
TCGAbiolinks R package (version 2.23.195);. Raw counts were normal-
ized, and gene expression levels were quantiﬁed as count per million
(cpm), fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (fpkm)
using functions of the edgeR R package (version 3.32.193); and z-score
subtracting the mean expression across samples and dividing it for the
standard deviation of each single gene. The METABRIC collection,
comprising gene expression data and clinical annotations for 997 breast
cancer samples, has been downloaded from the European Genome-
Phenome Archive (EGA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/) under accession
number EGAD0001000021096. Original Illumina probe identiﬁers have
been mapped to Entrez gene IDs using the Bioconductor illuminaHu-
manv3.db annotation package for Illumina HT-12 v3 arrays obtaining
log2 intensity values for a total of 19,761 genes. The TP53 status of
701 samples annotated as wild-type (n = 584) and ‘missense’ mutant p53
(n = 117) was derived from Silwal-Pandit et al.97.

Tumor classiﬁcation based on signature scores
Genes and gene sets expression levels have been calculated as the
average expression of single genes or all gene set genes in sample
subgroups (i.e., TP53 status). Genes up-regulated by the activation of
mTORC1 complex have been downloaded from the Molecular Sig-
nature Database (MSigDB) mTORC1 gene set (https://www.gsea-
msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/cards/HALLMARK_MTORC1_SIGNALING).
The “mutp53 AA metabolism” signature has been derived from the
intersection of signiﬁcant upregulated DEGs calculated from the
comparison “siCTL Low AA - siCTL complete medium” and down-
regulated DEGs calculated from the comparison “sip53 Low AA- siCTL
Low AA” (Suppl. Table 6).

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) library preparation from
mutp53 and wtp53 mice
Mammary gland from 8-week-old mice (one p53R172H/R172H knock-in
mouse and one p53+/+ mouse) were isolated and digested as pre-
viously described98. scRNAseq libraries were prepared by using
Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3.1 Dual Index (10X
Genomics) following manufacturer’s instructions. Estimated 16,500
cells were loaded to each channel with the average recovery rate of
10,000 cells. Brieﬂy, cells were resuspended in the master mix and
loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to
generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the
cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscribed to
cDNA, which contains an Illumina R1 primer sequence, Unique
Molecular Identiﬁer (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled bar-
coded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, ampliﬁed
by PCR and the appropriate size fragments were selected with
SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the
library construction Illumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end con-
structs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added. The
ﬁnal indexed libraries were quantiﬁed by using the Cell-free DNA
Screen Tape Assay (Agilent) on a TapeStation 4150 (Agilent) and were
sequenced on HiSeqX (Illumina).

Processing and quality control of scRNAseq data from mutp53
and wtp53 mice
FASTQ ﬁles were aligned utilizing 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v.6.1.1.
Each library was aligned to an indexed mm39 genome using Cell
Ranger Count. We applied stringent ﬁlters to eliminate cells with UMI
counts <1250 or >37000, gene counts <700, and mitochondrial gene
ratio>10% and with UMI counts <1750 or >50,000, gene counts <800,
and mitochondrial gene ratio >10% for the wtp53 and mutp53
respectively. This pre-ﬁltering resulted in the detection of 3206 and
3442 cells for the wtp53 and mutp53 respectively.

Cell doublets were estimated using Scrublet99. For each individual
sample, we ran Scrublet with default parameters using the raw count
data from CellRanger output. We then visualized the predicted singlets
and doublets on the UMAP space. One small group of cells was pre-
dicted as potential doublets; we did remove them from subsequent
analysis and remain with a total of 3169 and 3382 cells for the wtp53
and mutp53 respectively. Cell cycle estimation was performed in
Seurat using the default cell-cycle gene signatures.

Integration and clustering analysis of scRNAseq data from
mutp53 and wtp53 mice
Clustering of cells was performed using the Seurat R package100 on the
integrated data. Brieﬂy, single-cell data matrices were column-
normalized and log-transformed. To identify cell clusters, principal
component analysis (PCA) was ﬁrst performed and the top 20 PCs with
a resolution of 0.6 were used to obtain 21 clusters. To present high-
dimensional data in two-dimensional space, we performed UMAP
analysis using the results of PCA with the top 20 signiﬁcant PCs as
input. After data integration, cell type identiﬁcation was performed
using the expression of known marker genes (Suppl. Table 2). For
subclustering of epithelial cells, we subset the epithelial clusters from
mutp53 or wtp53 replicate using the R subset internal function.

Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare
epithelial cells from mutp53 and wtp53 samples by using Seurat’s
FindMarkers function (Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Differentially expressed genes were identiﬁed having an expres-
sion difference of at least 1-logfold and a p-value of <0.05. Pathway
analysis was performed using the GSEA software on all unﬁltered dif-
ferentially expressed genes using MSigDB v7.0101,102 curated canonical
pathway database, speciﬁcally Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome. To
ensure proper gene name mapping, all mouse gene names were con-
verted to their human homologs using NCBI Homologene prior to

analysis in GSEA. All the top enriched pathways regarding glucose,
amino acids and lipids metabolism were shown.

Analysis of ChIP-seq data
To retrieve mutp53 binding sites, we used ReMap202243, we chose
MDA-MB-231 cell experiments as a cell model, based on GEO GSE95303
data, and in particular the experiment GSM2501568. Moreover, we have
analyzed ChIP-seq data regarding histone modiﬁcations H3K4me3 and
H3K27Ac from the GEO GSE49651 regarding the same cell line.

Consequently, we have searched for TP53 peaks across the gen-
ome selecting genomic regions of interest and therefore retrieving
mutp53 peaks in our genes of interest (Suppl. Table 1). After that, we
checked if there were histone modiﬁcations indicating open chromatin
in the same regions.

Moreover, by using IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer, version
2.11.3)103, we have inspected ChIP-seq data from ReMap2022 looking
for TFs that bound the same regions of TP53 peaks on PSAT1, SLC7A5
and SLC3A2 promoters in the MDA-MB-231 cell-line, considering a
region extended by ±1000 nucleotides upstream or downstream the
selected. Among these, we selected TFs that bind to all these genes in
the same genomic loci of mutp53.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously
described61,62. Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in lysis buffer—50 mM HEPES
pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25%
Triton X-100, nuclei spun down, washed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and resuspended in shearing buffer—0.1%
SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5. Samples were sonicated using a
Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode; medium power setting) for a total
time of 30 min, to achieve an average size of 250–300 bp of the soni-
cated chromatin fragments. The shearing buffer was then supple-
mented to obtain the RIPA buffer of the composition as described in
Girardini et al., 201162 and the rest of the protocol was followed.
Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with the p53 DO-1 (sc-126, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated DNA was
analyzed by real-time PCR. Promoter occupancy was calculated as the
percentage of input chromatin immunoprecipitated using the 2 − ΔCt
method. Primer sequences are reported in the following table.

Metabolite extraction and liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry analysis
For metabolic tracing analyses, cells were exposed for 24 h to 12.5 mM
[U-13C6] glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, 389374) or 30 min to 802 μM [U-13C6]
Leucine (Sigma-Aldrich, 605239).

Metabolite extraction and analysis were performed as previously
described104. Brieﬂy, cells were harvested in 250 µl of ice-cold metha-
nol/acetonitrile 1:1 and spun at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Super-
natants were then passed through a regenerated cellulose ﬁlter, dried,
and resuspended in 100 µl methanol for subsequent analysis. Metha-
nolic samples were analyzed by 10 min runs in positive (amino acids)
and 5 min runs in negative (energy metabolites) ion mode with
35-multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transition in positive ion
mode and a 139-MRM transition in negative ion mode to analyze the
different isotopomers, respectively.

For targeted metabolomic analysis, cells were extracted using
tissue lyser for 30 s at maximum speed in 250 µL of ice-cold methanol:
water: acetonitrile 55:25:20 containing [U-13C6]-glucose 1 ng/µL and
[U-13C5]-glutamine 1 ng/µL as internal standards (Merk Life Science,
Milan, Italy). Lysates were spun at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, dried
under N2 ﬂow at 40 °C and resuspended in 125 µL of ice-cold methanol/
water 70:30 for subsequent analyses.

Amino acids analysis was performed through the previous deri-
vatization. Brieﬂy, 50 µl of 5% phenyl isothiocyanate in 31.5% ethanol
and 31.5% pyridine in water were added to 10 µl of each sample. Mix-
tures were then incubated with phenyl isothiocyanate solution for
20 min at room temperature, dried under N2 ﬂow, and suspended in
100 µl of 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol/ H2O 1:1. Quantiﬁca-
tion of different amino acids was performed by using a C18 column
(Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) maintained at 50 °C. The mobile phases
were phase A: 0.2% formic acid in water and phase B: 0.2% formic acid
in acetonitrile. The gradient was T0: 100% A, T5.5: 5% A and T7: 100% A
with a ﬂow rate of 500 µL/min.

Measurement of energy metabolites and cofactors was performed
by using a cyano-phase LUNA column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm; Phe-
nomenex, Bologna, Italy), maintained at 53 °C, by a 5 min run in
negative ion mode. The mobile phase A was water, while phase B was
2 mM ammonium acetate in MeOH, and the gradient was 50% A and
50% B for the whole analysis, with a ﬂow rate of 500 µL/min.

Acylcarnitines quantiﬁcation was performed using a ZORBAX SB-
CN 2.1x150mm, 5 µm column (Agilent, Milan, Italy). Samples were
analyzed by a 10 min run in positive ion mode. The mobile phases were
phase A: 0.2% formic acid in water and phase B: 0.2% formic acid in
acetonitrile. The gradient was The gradient was T0: 100% A, T5.5: 5% A
and T6: 100% A with a ﬂow rate of 350 µL/min.

All metabolites analyzed were previously validated by pure stan-
dards, and internal standards (only in targeted metabolomics analysis)
were used to check instrument sensitivity.

All data were acquired on an API-4000 triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer (AB Sciex) coupled with an HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies), a CTC PAL HTS autosampler (PAL System), and Triple
Quad 3500 (AB Sciex) with an HPLC system (AB Sciex) and a built-in
autosampler (AB Sciex). MultiQuant software (version 3.0.2) was used
for data analysis and peak review of chromatograms. Data processing,
normalization and analysis were performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0
web tool as previously described105.

Proliferation assay
Cells (1,2 × 104 to 4 × 104 cells/well depending on the cell lines) were
plated in 12-well plates in their regular medium. The next day, after
washing cells with PBS, the medium was changed with medium with
different amino acids concentration as indicated in the ﬁgures. At 3 or
6 days following the treatment, cells were trypsinized, suspended in
medium and counted. The relative cell number was calculated based
on the number of cells initially plated. Proliferation rate was deter-
mined using the following formula: Proliferation rate (doublings/day)
= [log2(Final Day 3 cell number/Initial Day 0 cell number)]/3 days12. For
each experimental condition, two technical replicates were plated and
counted.

BrdU incorporation assay
4T1 cells (1,2 × 104) were plated in 12-well plates in presence of dox-
ycycline. After 48 h, the DNA precursor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
(20 μM) was added to the medium for 3 h before ﬁxation.

For the experiment in low AA, the day after plating cells were
washed with PBS and the medium was changed with medium with
reduced amino acids concentration. At 36 h following the treatment,
BrdU (20 μM) was added to the medium for 12 h before ﬁxation. Brieﬂy,
the cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS,
permeabilized with Triton 0.1% for 10 min, and washed three times with

NaOH 50 mM solution and washed in PBS. Primary anti-BrdU antibody
solution (1:2 dilution), to detect incorporated BrdU, was used for 2 h at
37 °C and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technologies) was
used as the secondary antibody for 1 h a 37 °C. Nuclei were counter-
stained with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies). The percentage of
cells incorporating BrdU out of 100–150 nuclei/condition in immu-
nostained samples was determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy.

For BrdU assay in DCIS spheroids, BrdU (20 μM) was added to
the medium for 12 h before ﬁxation. Brieﬂy, the cells were ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS, permeabilized with
Triton 0.5%/5% HS/PBS for 14 h at 4 °C. and washed three times with
NaOH 50 mM solution, and washed in PBS. Primary anti-BrdU anti-
body solution (1:2 dilution), to detect incorporated BrdU, was used
for 14 h at 4 °C and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technolo-
gies) was used as the secondary antibody for 2 h at room tempera-
ture. Nuclei were stained with Dapi (Sigma Aldrich, 32670-F) for
15 min. The percentage of cells incorporating BrdU out of 900 nuclei/
spheroid in immunostained samples was determined by ﬂuorescence
microscopy.

Colony formation assay
Cells (5 × 102 to 4 × 103 cells/well depending on the cell lines) were
plated in 6/12-well plates. The next day, after washing cells with PBS,
the medium was changed with medium with 25% of amino acids and
upon treatments as indicated in the ﬁgures. Growth continued until
the appearance of clones (at least 1 week). Brieﬂy, the cells were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS, and stained with
GIEMSA solution (1:10 in water) for 1 h. Colonies ≥1000 pixels were
counted using countPHICS software after background subtraction.

In vivo procedures
6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected with: 1 × 105 or
5 × 104 4T1 TetOn clone cells in PBS orthotopically into the mammary
fat pad, under general anesthesia. Doxycycline was given in their
drinking water to induce mutp53 expression. After palpable tumors
were detected, mice were treated with NCT503 (38 mg/kg) and JPH203
(20 mg/kg). Tumor growth was monitored every 2 to 3 days by caliper
measurements and the volume was calculated using the formula:
tumor volume (mm3) =Dxd2/2, where D and d are the longest and the
shortest diameters, respectively. At 24 days after the injection, mice
were euthanized, and primary tumors were extracted and directly
frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analyses.

All mice were housed in ventilated cages, monitored daily by
ICGEB BioExperimentation Facility staff, and had food and water ad
libitum. Mice were weighed at least two times per week.

Procedures involving animals and their care were in conformity
with national (D. L. 26/2014 and subsequent implementing circulars)
and international (EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments)
laws and policies, and the experimental protocol (Authorization n.
347/2022-PR) was approved by the Ethical Committee of the ICGEB
and by the Italian Ministry of Health.

Statistics
All the experiments are representative of at least three independent
repeats. Graph bars represent mean±s.d. from at least n = 3 biological
replicates. P values were determined using the following statistic tests
as indicated in ﬁgure legends: two-tailed Student’s t-test, with a 95%
conﬁdence threshold; One-way ANOVA (Fisher’s LSD) (α < 0.05); Exact
test p-value (FDR) (α < 0.05); Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (pval) and
Bonferroni correction (padj) (α < 0.05); Wald test and Bonferroni
correction (padj) (α < 0.05).
