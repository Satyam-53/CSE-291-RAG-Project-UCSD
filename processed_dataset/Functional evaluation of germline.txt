Germline TP53 pathogenic variants can lead to a cancer susceptibility syndrome known as Li–
Fraumeni (LFS). Variants affecting its activity can drive tumorigenesis altering p53 pathways and 
their identification is crucial for assessing individual risk. This study explored the functional impact 
of TP53 missense variants on its transcription factor activity. We selected seven TP53 missense 
variants (c.129G > C, c.320A > G, c.417G > T, c.460G > A, c,522G > T, c.589G > A and c.997C > T) identified 
in Brazilian families at‑risk for LFS. Variants were created through site‑directed mutagenesis and 
transfected into SK‑OV‑3 cells to assess their transcription activation capabilities. Variants K139N and 
V197M displayed significantly reduced transactivation activity in a TP53‑dependent luciferase reporter 
assay. Additionally, K139N negatively impacted CDKN1A and MDM2 expression and had a limited 
effect on GADD45A and PMAIP1 upon irradiation‑induced DNA damage. Variant V197M demonstrated 
functional impact in all target genes evaluated and loss of Ser15 phosphorylation. K139N and 
V197M variants presented a reduction of p21 levels after irradiation. Our data show that K139N and 
V197M negatively impact p53 functions, supporting their classification as pathogenic variants. This 
underscores the significance of conducting functional studies on germline TP53 missense variants 
classified as variants of uncertain significance to ensure proper management of LFS‑related cancer 
risks.

Pathogenic germline variants in TP53 are associated with a complex inherited cancer-predisposing disorder 
known as Li–Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS)1. Patients with LFS are prone to develop a wide range of early-onset 
cancers, such as breast cancer, glioblastomas, osteosarcomas, and adrenocortical carcinomas, among  others2–5. 
Thus, identifying individuals at risk for LFS is particularly important to optimize surveillance aimed at down-
staging and ultimately improved survival.

Li–Fraumeni families face a significantly increased risk for several cancer types, nearly 24 times higher than 
the general population (standardized incidence ratio 23.9; 95% CI 21.9–26.0) for any  cancer6. While guidelines 
exist for managing and preventing carriers of TP53 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, as well as those 
with other syndromes related to TP53 germline  variants4,7–9, establishing appropriate management for carriers of 
variants of uncertain significance (VUS) remains challenging, relying solely on family  history10. Missense vari-
ants account for nearly 74% of all germline TP53 alterations reported, and many of them remain  unclassified11,12. 
Variants classified as VUS yield inconclusive genetic information, often with limited data on their functional 
impact on tumorigenesis. This limitation hampers proper patient management and follow-up.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreportsThe TP53 gene encodes for a tumor suppressor protein that preserves genome integrity and prevents tumo-
rigenesis by regulating DNA repair, cell growth, senescence, and cell  death13,14. p53 acts as a transcription fac-
tor, promoting or repressing transcription, and interacts with DNA as a  tetramer15–17. Secondary and tertiary 
structural features of p53 determine its affinity and specificity during DNA sequence recognition and  binding18. 
Theoretically, deleterious alterations in highly conserved amino acid residues can disrupt the conformation of 
structural domains, thereby influencing p53 function.

Functional assays provide key information for variant classification. Particularly in the analysis of VUS with 
low population frequency. These assays unveil the impact of the VUS on protein function, when combined with 
available genetic and epidemiologic information, can contribute to cancer causality prediction  algorithms19–22. 
In this study, we used a TP53-mutated human ovarian cancer cell line that lacks p53 expression at both protein 
and mRNA  levels23. This model was utilized to assess the functional analysis of seven TP53 missense variants 
identified in Brazilian families at-risk for LFS.

Results
Personal and family history of cancer, in silico predicted impact of TP53 variants, and previ‑
ously reported functional analysis
The personal and family history of patients carrying the selected TP53 variants are described in Table 1 and were 
previously published by Bittar et al.24.

Regarding the in silico predictions and the previously reported functional assays, REVEL predominantly 
classified most variants as pathogenic or having a medium impact and no variant showed an impact on splice 
sites (Table 1). The L43F and R333C variants were considered functional, and the others were considered non-
functional or partially functional by Kato et al.20. Other in silico prediction tools were also accessed so that, 
together with our results from functional assays, we could propose a new classification for the variants evaluated. 
All results are described in Supplementary Table 1.

Expression and transcription transactivation activity of p53 variants
To verify the ability of our TP53 constructs, with the selected variants (Fig. 1A), to restore p53 expression in 
the p53-null SK-OV-3 cells (characterized by the absence of functional p53 protein), we transfected the cell 
and evaluated mRNA and protein expression. Figure 1B shows the presence of p53 mRNA in all conditions 
(pcDNA3-TP53 WT and variants), except for the empty vector (pcDNA3). These results were corroborated by 
protein analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1).

To assess the functional effects of the seven TP53 VUS, we performed a luciferase reporter assay to quan-
titatively measure the capacity of each p53 variant to transactivate luciferase expression through the p53

were considered statistically significant; (*) p < 0.05; (****) p < 0.0001.

DNA-binding site (derived from WAF1 promoter)19. Overall, four variants (L43F, Y107C, G154S and R174S) 
showed comparable activity to wild-type p53 (100%), ranging from 86.7 to 124.1% (Fig. 1C). The R333C variant 
significantly increased luciferase expression (198.7%), while the K139N variant showed residual activity with 
a statistically significant reduction in transactivation activity compared to the WT construct (62.9%). Notably, 
V197M showed negligible reporter activity (3.6%), similar to the absence of p53 condition (empty vector). No 
transcriptional activity was reported for V197M, even upon DNA damage induction (data not shown).

K139N and V197M variants impact p53 target genes expression
To confirm the functional impact observed in the transcription transactivation assay for all seven variants, we 
evaluated the ability of p53 variants to induce expression of key downstream target, including CDKN1A, MDM2, 
GADD45A and PMAIP1. Cells expressing wild-type p53 exhibited elevated mRNA levels for CDKN1A (Fig. 2A), 
MDM2 (Fig. 2B), GADD45A (Fig. 2C) and PMAIP1 (Fig. 2D) compared to cells transfected with empty vector. 
Upon DNA damage induction through ionizing irradiation, the expression of all tested target genes increased, 
except for GADD45A, which maintained its expression levels.

In general, the L43F, Y107C, G154S, R174S and R333C variants showed comparable or higher expression lev-
els of CDKN1A, MDM2, GADD45A and PMAIP1 compared to WT condition. Cells expressing the K139N variant 
showed limited CDKN1A, MDM2 and GADD45A expression induction, with the exception of the PMAIP1 gene. 
While the K139N variant displayed higher levels of PMAIP1 expression than the WT control before irradiation, 
a substantial decrease was observed after DNA damage. The V197M variant substantially impacts mRNA levels 
for the CDKN1A gene. However, this variant shows a limited induction of mRNA expression for the other target 
genes (MDM2, GADD45A, and PMAIP1) in both, irradiated and non-irradiated, conditions. The observed results 
for target gene expression in cells carrying the K139N and V197M variants align with the functional impact 
observed during transcriptional transactivation with these p53 variants.

Loss of p53 Ser15 phosphorylation and impact on p21 protein levels
We also examined the impact of each variant on the phosphorylation of serine residue 15 in p53 (phospho-p53 
Ser15) and p21 protein expression (Fig. 3). All variants, except for K139N and V197M, led to an increase in 
p21 protein levels after transfection (Fig. 3A–C). Following DNA damage, L43F and Y107C induced higher p21 
protein levels than those induced by wild-type p53, while the other three variants showed similar p21 induction.

were normalized by endogenous housekeeping gene GUSB. The WT conditions were settled = 1 and the mRNA 
expression of CDKN1A (A), MDM2 (B), GADD45A (C) and PMAIP (D) genes were relativized by WT. The 
statistical comparisons between the variants were performed with their respective WT conditions (control 
or 10 Gy). p-values < 0.05 (*) were considered statistically significant; (**) p < 0.005; (***) p < 0.001; and (****) 
p < 0.0001. UT = untreated.

The phospho-p53 Ser15 levels significantly increased with wild-type p53 and the variants, except for V197M 
(Fig. 3A, B). Notably, V197M demonstrated a significant reduction in phospho-p53 Ser15 levels, equivalent to 
the control (empty vector), even after DNA damage.

Presence of K139N and V197M variants affects p53 nuclear stabilization
Phosphorylation of serine residue 15 is crucial for stabilization of p53 in the nucleus after DNA  damage8. Con-
sequently, we compared the capacity of p53 WT, K139N and V197M variants to translocate to the nucleus upon 
DNA damage. The evaluation of p53 WT, K139N and V197M variants localization after irradiation was per-
formed through immunofluorescence assay. As expected, the presence of the K139N variant significantly impairs 
the nuclear accumulation of p53 compared to p53 WT condition (p < 0.005). In contrast, the presence of V197M 
variant does not abolish p53 translocation nor does it affect p53’s nuclear levels compared to p53 WT (Fig. 4).

Discussion
The presence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the TP53 gene can lead to Li–Fraumeni Syn-
drome or Li–Fraumeni like syndrome. Interpreting the pathogenicity of variants identified in patients, particu-
larly missense variants, can be  challenging24,25, however adequate classification means appropriate management 
for carriers of variants in TP53 gene. The process of variant classification is complex and considers specificities 
of each gene, such as the minimum population frequency that takes into account the penetrance of the gene in 
question (PM2/BS1), personal and family history (PP4), variant segregation (PP1), case–control studies (PS4), 
variant type (PVS1), in silico prediction (PP3/BP4), and functional assays (PS3/BS3), among other criteria. 
From this perspective, we selected seven missense variants, identified in families at-risk for hereditary cancer 
and classified as VUS by  ClinVar26, to conduct functional assays and provide additional evidence, as the ACMG 
guidelines recognize them among the most robust types of evidence for determining variant  pathogenicity10.

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/Figure 3.   Analysis of p21 and p-p53 Ser15 protein levels upon DNA damage. (A)—Western blot of p53 
(53KDa), p-p53 Ser15 (53KDa), p21 (21KDa) and β-actin (42KDa), in a control or irradiated (10 Gy) 
conditions. Cellular protein levels of p-p53Ser15 (B) and p21 (C) in SK-OV-3 cell line overexpressing 
exogenous p53 (WT or variants) were quantified in control and 4 h after ionizing irradiation (10 Gy) conditions. 
p-values < 0.05 (*) were considered statistically significant. The analyzes were performed from two independent 
experiments.

Considering the results observed in the transactivation capability (TA assay) for K139N and V197M variants 
in addition to defective expression of selected p53 target genes (CDKN1A, MDM2, GADD45A, and PMAIP1) we 
can confirm the impact on transcriptional function for both variants. P53 is a well-characterized transcriptional 
activation factor for genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA  repair15,27,28, consequently, the failure 
of K139N and V197M variants to induce the expression of these genes demonstrated a deleterious behavior, akin 
to other TP53 variants previously associated with cancer  predisposition19,20,29.

The K139N variant showed a reduction in mRNA levels of CDKN1A and MDM2, while V197M showed a 
clear loss of expression for CDKN1A. The impacts in transcriptional activation for CDKN1A and MDM2 genes 
can be stronger because their expression is mainly regulated by p53, meanwhile, GADD45A and PMAIP1 mRNA 
levels are regulated by many other proteins, including  p5330–32. For this reason, the impact on their expression 
levels is much more subtle. WT p53 induces a slight increase in GADD45A expression after irradiation which 
may be explained by the plethora of proteins regulating it. For MDM2, we also observed an increase in mRNA 
levels after irradiation, but surely, we expected a bigger difference. Here, we used SK-OV-3 cells, a p53 null cell 
line, that has been previously shown to induce an increase in MDM2 protein levels when expressing exogenous 
WT  p5333,34. We corroborated this by observing our mRNA data comparing empty vector and WT p53 condi-
tions without irradiation. Thus, we expected that, after irradiation, induction of MDM2 expression wouldn’t be 
substantial since its expression has already been influenced by p53 transfection.

The loss of phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in the presence of the V197M variant could be explained by the 
failure in the transcriptional activation. This phenomenon is critical for its tetramer stabilization, the expres-
sion of target genes, and cell cycle  arrest35, corroborating that p21 protein levels were significantly lower than 
in the p53 WT condition. On the hand, the presence of the K139N variant maintained its Ser15 phosphoryla-
tion; however, also presented p21 protein levels significantly lower than WT condition. Regarding the R333C 
variant, the observed functional profile like WT, is consistent with Fisher et al. who demonstrated that the cells 
were still able to form a multimeric structure in an in vitro p53-null  model36. The results also corroborated with 
Kato et al.20 and Giacomelli et al.37, which described this variant as functional and not-DNE/LOF, respectively. 
In addition, the classification by  ClinVar26 has recently changed, after we select variants and performance of 
functional assays in this work, and now is considered likely benign. We can also highlight that even carriers of

variants classified as B/LB should benefit from better management, demonstrating the importance of improving 
the variant classification system.

Concerning the reduction in the nuclear levels of p53 upon DNA damage in the presence of the K139N vari-
ant, this lysine residue (139), along with two other residues, serves as an MDM2 target for ubiquitination and 
is responsible for p53 nuclear  export38. Therefore, the alteration of the MDM2 ubiquitination site could lead to 
the abolishment of p53 nuclear levels. In the case of the V197M variant, the loss of Ser15 phosphorylation could 
have resulted in a reduction of p53’s tetramerization and, consequently, a decrease in its nuclear levels.

All analyses were conducted to enhance the characterization of pathogenicity for seven missense variants 
carried by families at-risk for hereditary cancer, some of whom reported a classical personal or family history 
of Li–Fraumeni  Syndrome2–4. The results obtained from functional assays corroborated the personal and family 
history reported by carriers of variants demonstrating an impact on p53 functionality, as they reported a sig-
nificant family history of cancer. Typically, families carrying variants considered pathogenic exhibit this pattern 
of family history, characterized by multiple tumors, some of which may manifest at young ages. The functional 
characterization of variants facilitates improved management and screening of patients and families carrying the 
same variants, enabling early tumor diagnosis and the establishment of an effective cancer surveillance  program39. 
Additionally, it has been previously demonstrated that the adoption of surveillance for patients with LFS by the 
Brazilian National Health Care System is cost-beneficial40.

It is worth mentioning that there are already specific guidelines for classifying variants in the TP53  gene41, 
recommending the use of, among several other criteria, an in silico tool and some specific functional  assays20,37. 
In this work, we assessed the results of Kato et al.20 and Giacomelli et al.37, to help in our final suggestion of clas-
sification. Furthermore, we chose to evaluate specific functions of the protein, with assays used in other works 
in the  literature42–44, including expression of other genes regulated by p53, also evaluated by Kato et al.20 and 
Kawaguchi et al.45. Our results corroborate Kato et al.20 observations for the K139N variant, while this variant 
was not classified by Giacomelli et al.37. Additionally, V197M variant was classified as DNE/LOF37 and partially 
 functional20, in a similar way to our findings. We also point out that, recently, the classification of the V197M 
variant in  ClinVar26 changed to conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (one LP classification and three VUS), 
and this germline variant was previously identified in another Brazilian family suggestive of Li–Fraumeni46.

Finally, evidence from functional assays is among the highest levels of evidence in variant  classification10. 
There is an increasing emergence of large-scale assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of variants, mainly aiming 
to reduce the number of variants classified as VUS and to improve the classification system for little-known 
variants. However, it is important to mention that it was observed in the analysis of variants present in genes 
associated with the Lynch Syndrome that, although these assays provide important data on mechanisms, they 
also have several challenges and offer less precision when compared to individual  assessments47. Taken together, 
our results, along with the patients’ family history (another important parameter to be considered), demonstrate 
that the presence of K139N or V197M variants adversely affects the functionality of p53, as well as the pathways 
regulated by this protein. The use of robust functional assays can help in the classification of identified variants,

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/in addition to validating data from in silico prediction computational tools. However, it is worth highlighting that 
the variant’s classification is a dynamic process, and other parameters are also considered for the classification of 
a variant, such as population frequency, family segregation studies and case–control  studies10.

Accordingly, we propose that these data could be taken into consideration in the classification of the K139N 
and V197M variants, potentially warranting their categorization as likely pathogenic (Supplementary Table 1). 
Another possibility would be that like what already exists in variant curation expert panels, such as BRCA1/2, 
differentiated weights of PS3/BS3 could be assigned to functional assays so that they can assist in the classifica-
tion of a given variant, even with a lower weight than the originally proposed criterion. Patients with variants 
classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic could benefit from well-established management according to the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)7, as well as from the possibility to perform cascade testing 
in the family, thus offering personalized prevention measures for those relatives.

Conclusions
In summary, using multiple independent functional assays, we demonstrated a deleterious functional impact on 
p53 caused by the K139N and V197M variants. Furthermore, the functional analyses conducted here, suggesting 
structural interference for both variants, may contribute to the annotation of these variants, enabling a more 
accurate assessment of cancer risk for carrier families and influencing their clinical outcomes.

Methods
Ethical considerations
All clinical data presented in this work was previous published by Bittar et al.24, we did not generate any datasets, 
use any human sample for de functional assays or human database for analysis. No additional clinical informa-
tion was disclosed in this work.

Patients and variant selection
Genetic germline testing results, including analysis of the TP53 (NM_000546; GrCh37) gene of patients from 
cancer risk evaluation programs in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed (Hospital de Clínicas de 
Porto Alegre and Barretos Cancer Hospital). Variants classified as VUS according to the American College of 
Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)10 in a clinical diagnostic  setting24 were selected for functional analyses in the 
present study. Variants were selected based on their location within p53’s important motifs and domains that 
impact the correct functioning of the protein (Supplementary Fig. 1A), classification at  ClinVar26 (VUS) and 
phenotype (personal and family history of cancer). We also considered the in silico predictions by REVEL and 
Splice AI, and the functional assays previously published by Kato et al.20 as recommended by Fortuno et al.41.

Screening and confirmation of TP53 variants
Variants selected for functional studies were confirmed by Sanger or NGS sequencing by the Molecular Diagnos-
tic Laboratory from Barretos Cancer Hospital and/or Hospital das Clínicas de Porto Alegre. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from peripheral blood using the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini QIAcube Kit (QIAGEN, #51126) with the 
automated QIAcube (Qiagen) platform following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was amplified 
by PCR and purified with the Affymetrix™ExoSAP-IT™ (#15513687) enzyme. Sequencing was performed with 
the BigDye™ Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #4337456) and purified with the 
X-terminator kit v3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #4376484). Finally, sequencing was performed on an automated 
sequencer model 3500 (Applied Biosystems).

Plasmid vector constructions
TP53 missense variants were generated using as template the pcDNA3:flag-p53 plasmid containing human 
wild type (WT) TP53 cDNA (Addgene, #10838). TP53 variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as 
described  previously48. Briefly, PCR amplification conditions were designed using PrimeSTAR® Max Polymerase 
(Takara, #R045A) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Mutagenesis primers are listed in Supplementary 
Table 2. The PCR products were digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs, #R0176S) overnight and trans-
formed into NEB® 5-alpha Competent Escherichia coli cells (New England Biolabs, #C2981I). Single colonies 
were selected and sequenced to confirm the insertion of each variant of interesting and no additional alterations.

Cell culture
The SK-OV-3 (HTB-77; ATCC) ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, 
#11530586) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, #26140079), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/
mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a 5%  CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cell line authenticity 
was confirmed by DNA short tandem repeat  analysis49. Moreover, mycoplasma contamination was assay using 
MycoAlert® Mycoplasma Detection Assays (Lonza, #LT07-318).

RNA extraction, RT‑PCR, and real‑time PCR
To evaluate the expression of genes regulated by p53, total RNA was extracted from transfected SK-OV-3 cells 
after DNA damage induction or in a basal condition (untreated), and the RT-PCR was performed. For this, cells 
were plated at a density of 5 ×  105 cells per well in a 6-well plate, allowed to adhere overnight, transfected with 
4 µg of plasmid constructions, and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, for DNA damage condition, cells were 
irradiated with 10 Gy using the Rad Source 2000 Irradiator (Rad Source Technologies), after that, they were 
incubated for 4 h and the RNA was extracted, using TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #15596018).

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/The same extraction step was performed for untreated cells. Then, 1 µg of RNA was used for cDNA synthe-
sis with SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #18080093) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix 
(Applied Biosystems, #4444557) and PrimeTime Standard® qPCR Assay (IDT) probes. The evaluated targets were 
CDKN1A (Hs.PT.58.40874346.g), MDM2 (Hs.PT.58.358457), GADD45A (Hs.PT.58.20049396), PMAIP1 (Hs.
PT.58.21318159), and endogenous genes GUSB (Hs.PT.58v.27737538) and TP53 (Hs.PT.58.123122), were used 
as endogenous controls. Reactions were performed in triplicate using the QuantStudio™ 6 Flex Real Time PCR 
System (Applied Biosystems). Reference genes were normalized by geometric means, and relative quantification 
measurements of target genes were determined using the comparative Ct method (2-ΔΔCt).

Transcription activation assay
To assess TP53 missense variant functionality, we used the transcriptional activation (TA)  assay37. Briefly, 
SK-OV-3 cells were seeded at a density of 3.5 ×  104 cells per well in a 96-well plate. Co-transfection was per-
formed using vector constructions containing p53 WT (pcDNA3:flag-p53) or the selected missense variants, 
the pG13-Luc (Addgene, #16442) and pLX313-Renilla Luciferase (Addgene, #118016) plasmids, with Lipo-
fectamine™3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000008). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and TA was measured 
using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega, #E1910). All assays were conducted in triplicate 
and repeated at least three times.

Immunoblotting and antibodies
To compare protein expression among different p53 conditions, SK-OV-3 cells were plated at a density of 5 ×  105 
cells per well in a 6-well plate, allowed to adhere overnight, transfected with 4 µg of plasmid constructions, and 
incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy using the Rad Source 2000 Irradiator (Rad 
Source Technologies), incubated for 4 h and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (0.01 M EDTA, 1 mM de PMSF, 1 mM 
DTT, 0.1 µg/mL aprotinin e 1 mM leupeptin) for 30 min. Protein quantification was performed by the Bradford 
 method50. Sample proteins (25 µg) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to 
Hybond-C™ Extra—(Amersham Biosciences, #45004018) membranes, using the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer 
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Non-specific sites were blocked with 5% milk, and membranes were incubated 
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, including mouse monoclonal β-actin (Abcam, #ab49900), mouse 
monoclonal p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2524), mouse monoclonal phospho-p53 Ser15 (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology, #9286), rabbit monoclonal p21 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2947). Membranes were further incubated 
for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG, HRP linked antibody (Cell Signaling, #7074) or anti-mouse 
IgG, HRP-linked Antibody (Cell Signaling, #7076). The membranes were exposed to the SignalFire™ ECL Reagent 
(Cell Signaling, #6883) and photo documented by ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (Cytiva).

Nuclear p53 levels by immunofluorescence
To assess the impairment of p53 nuclear translocation, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis. A den-
sity of of 2 ×  104 cells was seeded per coverslip and incubated for 24 h. Constructs carrying p53 WT, K139N or 
V197M variants were transfected into the cells. After 24 h, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy and incubated for 30 
 minutes51. Cells were then fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. 
A blocking solution (5% BSA) was added for one hour, followed by incubation with anti-p53 (1C12) antibody 
(Cell Signaling Technology, #2524), diluted at 1:50, overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, coverslips were incubated 
with donkey anti-mouse IgG (AlexaFluor® 488; Abcam, #ab150105), at a concentration of 1:1000 for one hour in 
the dark, at room temperature. Finally, ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, #P36941) was 
added, and the coverslip was mounted onto the slide. Images were acquired using the Olympus FluoView FV10i 
(Olympus) fluorescent confocal microscope. Analysis was performed in the ImageJ software (National Institutes 
of Health), and the ratio between Integrated Density and cell number (according to DAPI) was calculated.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 
9.0 software (California, USA). Comparisons of two variances were assessed by the One-way ANOVA test with 
Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test. The threshold for significance was established at p < 0.05.
