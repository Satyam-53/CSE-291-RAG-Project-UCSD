This study explores whether luteolin can mitigate MIRI by regulating the p53 signaling pathway. Methods: Model mice were subjected to a temporary surgical ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and administered luteolin. The myocardial infarct size, myocardial enzyme levels, and cardiac function were measured. Latent targets and signaling pathways were screened using network pharmacology and molecular docking. Then, proteins related to the p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis and oxidative stress were measured. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-incubated HL1 cells were used to validate the effects of luteolin in vitro. In addition, a p53 agonist and an inhibitor were used to investigate the mechanism. Results: Luteolin reduced the myocardial infarcted size and myocardial enzymes, and restored cardiac function in MIRI mice. Network pharmacology identiﬁed p53 as a hub target. The bioinformatic analyses showed that luteolin had anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties. Additionally, luteolin halted the activation of p53, and prevented both apoptosis and oxidative stress in myocardial tissue in vivo. Furthermore, luteolin inhibited cell apoptosis, JC-1 monomer formation, and reactive oxygen species elevation in HR-incubated HL1 cells in vitro. Finally, the p53 agonist NSC319726 downregulated the protective attributes of luteolin in the MIRI mouse model, and both luteolin and the p53 inhibitor piﬁthrin-a demonstrated a similar therapeutic effect in the MIRI mice. Conclusion: Luteolin effectively treats MIRI and may ameliorate myocardial damage by regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress through its targeting of the p53 signaling pathway.

Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 may however lead to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) [3,4]. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is an important mechanism of MIRI, which may impair myocardial function. However, drugs aimed at mitigating myocardial cell apoptosis and their potential mechanisms necessitate further study . Luteolin, also known as 30,40,5,7-tetrahydroxy ﬂavone, is primarily sourced from fruits, vegetables, and edible parts of various plants . Luteolin has antioxidative, anticancer, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-inﬂammatory, and neuroprotective properties, making it widely beneﬁcial in the management of various ailments . As an anticancer agent it has been shown to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . It can also inhibit nuclear factor-E2 like bZIP transcription factor 2 to promote the expression of heme oxygenase 1, thereby exerting signiﬁcant protective effects during oxidative stress . Currently, the attention to the luteolin’s application in cardiovascular diseases is gradually gaining [9,10]. Previous studies have demonstrated that luteolin can reduce the mortality rate among individuals suffering from coronary heart disease, as well as ameliorate myocardial damage [11–14]. However, the underlying mechanism through which luteolin exerts its cardioprotective effect in MIRI is not yet known. luteolin’s to measure To investigate the mechanism by which luteolin exerts its cardioprotective effects, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments on the phosphorylation of p53 and its ability to protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury. This research emphasizes the cardioprotective role of luteolin in mitigating myocardial injury through the inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress. suppressive effect 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Luteolin (purity > 98%; CAS: 491-70-3) and NSC319726 (purity > 95%; CAS: 71555-25-4) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Piﬁthrin-a (purity > 98%, CAS: 60477-38-5) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Luteolin, NSC319726, and piﬁthrin-a were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently mixed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to achieve a ﬁnal solution with a DMSO concentration below 0.01%. 2.2. Animals This study used 8 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice (Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) that had been raised in a speciﬁc-pathogen-free environment with temperature at (24 ± 2) ℃ and humidity at 55% ± 10% and subjected to a 12 h day/night cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal study procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Animal Research Institute Committee, as sanctioned by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (ethical approval no. 3554). Mice were divided according to a random number table method into the sham group, sham + luteolin (SL) group, ischemia/reperfusion model (IR) group, and ischemia/reperfusion + luteolin (IL) group. Each group had six mice. The dosage and administration of luteolin in this study followed the methods of previous studies [15–18]. The dose was calculated according to recommended daily intake for humans and modiﬁed for mouse physiology. The IL group was given luteolin at 10 mg/ 653 (kg∙d) for 7 d before ischemia/reperfusion surgery and for another 3 d after the surgery. The sham group underwent thoracotomy without coronary artery ligation. The IR group underwent thoracotomy and coronary artery ligation. The SL group was administered the same dosage and duration of luteolin as in the IL group without undergoing coronary artery ligation. In the ischemia/reperfusion + luteolin + NSC319726 (ILN) group, NSC319726 at a dose of 10 mg/(kg∙d) was administrated from 3 d before the ischemia/reperfusion surgery and continued until 3 d after the surgery. In the ischemia/reperfusion + piﬁthrin-a (IPa) group, piﬁthrin-a (1.1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally every other day, commencing on the 7th day before surgery and was continued until the 3rd day after surgery. 2.3. Establishment of the mouse model of MIRI Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion surgery was performed according to the experimental model guidelines for myocardial ischemia and infarction . The mice were injected with pentobarbital (1%, 40 mg/kg) for anesthesia, restrained in a supine position and ventilated at a respiratory rate of 110 times/min. The mouse chest movements were then monitored to assess breathing and conﬁrm successful intubation. Following meticulous hair removal and sterilization of the surgical area, the thoracotomy was performed to visualize the heart. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated with sutures under a microscope and the slipknot was opened 30 min later. After the mice woke up, they were taken off the ventilator and received focused care for 3 d. 2.4. Myocardial infarction area detection After euthanizing the mice 3 d post-ischemia/reperfusion surgery, Evans blue (3%, 1 mL) was injected into the inferior vena cava. The hearts of the mice were excised, frozen, uniformly sectioned along the longitudinal axis into ﬁve slices (approximately 2.5 mm in thickness), and sequentially stained with 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 ℃ for 20 min; subsequently they were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and photographed. In the stained results, blue indicates the presence of healthy myocardial tissue, red represents the area at risk, and white represents the infarcted region. The areas were measured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) with the percentage of the infarcted area represented as the proportion of the white region to the total heart section area. 2.5. Echocardiography The cardiac functions of mice were assessed using M-mode echocardiography with a Vevo 2100 Imaging System (FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). Two-dimensional targeted M-mode traces were recorded from the parasternal short-axis view at the mid-papillary muscle level and from the parasternal long-axis view below the papillary muscle. A minimum of six consecutive cardiac cycles were obtained. The left ventricular systolic diameter (LVIDs), left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVIDd), left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) were assessed. The velocities of early diastolic ﬁlling peak (E-wave) and late diastolic ﬁlling peak (Awave) of mitral valve blood ﬂow were also examined, along with the E-wave deceleration time (DT). The E/A ratio was the ratio of the E-wave velocity to the A-wave velocity. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were calculated as: P. Zhai, X.H. Ouyang, M.L. Yang et al. Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 LVEF ¼ LVEDV (cid:2) LVESV LVEDV (cid:3) 100%: LVFS ¼ LVIDd (cid:2) LVIDs LVIDd (cid:3) 100%: 2.6. Detection of myocardial enzymes and oxidative stress indicators Blood samples were collected 1 d post-ischemia/reperfusion surgery and centrifuged to retain the serum. Serum creatine kinase (CK) and CK muscle/brain subtype (CK-MB) were detected using a CK assay kit (A032-1-1) and CK-MB isoenzyme assay kit (E006-11), respectively, from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). The level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SEKM-0153, Solarbio, Inc., Beijing, China). Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) were analyzed using assay kits (A003-1-1, A001-3-2, and A006-2-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).

HL1 cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with the ﬂuorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, 10 lmol/L) at 37 ℃ for 30 min. Cells were acquired and analyzed using a CytoFLEXTM ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). 2.13. Cell culture and cell viability analysis The murine cardiac muscle cell line (HL1) was purchased from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (CL-06–5, Wuhan, China). To establish the hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) model, HL1 cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions of 95% N2 + 5% CO2 for 12 h at 37 ℃. The cells were then relocated to a normoxic incubation at 37 ℃ for 6 h of reoxygenation. The normal control group was cultivated within a conventional incubator setting. In the 6-hour reoxygenation, the HR model group was incubated with PBS, the HR + luteolin group was incubated with luteolin, and the HR + luteolin + NSC group was incubated with 10 lmol/L NSC319726. The HL1 cells were nurtured in 96-well plates (1 (cid:3) 104 cells/ In brief, 10 lL Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent well).

The comparison between the two groups was performed by unpaired t-test. P-value < 0.05 indicates statistical signiﬁcance. 3. Results 3.1. Luteolin decreased myocardial infarction area and enzyme levels and reinstated cardiac function after MIRI in vivo To assess the therapeutic efﬁcacy of luteolin against MIRI, luteolin was administered to MIRI mice, and the myocardial enzymes, myocardial infarct size, and cardiac contractility of mice were examined. The size of infarcts in myocardial tissue was evaluated using Evans blue and TTC dual staining. Fig. 1A and 1B illustrate the reduction in the extent of infarctions within the IL group, compared to the IR group. Serum CK, CK-MB, and cTnI levels were elevated in the IR group relative to the sham group. Administration of luteolin reduced serum CK, CK-MB, and cTnI concentrations in the mice of the IL group compared to the IR group (Fig. 1C). The echocardiographic ﬁndings revealed notable reductions in LVEF and LVFS among the IR group in contrast to the sham group. Conversely, the IL group exhibited heightened levels of these two indicators in contrast to the IR group, implying the restoration of myocardial contractile power in mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury (Fig. 1D and 1E). Luteolin also signiﬁcantly improved LVIDd and LVIDs in the IR group (Fig. 1D and 1E), but did not improve the E/A ratio or the DT of the mitral valve (Supplementary ﬁgure S1). In contrast with the sham group, the provision of luteolin to mice subjected to the sham operation did not induce any modiﬁcation in the area of the infarct, cardiac enzymes, or cardiac function, indicating that luteolin did not have signiﬁcant toxic side effects in the mice (Fig. 1). Collectively, these ﬁndings showed that luteolin exerts a protective function in MIRI. 3.2. p53 was identiﬁed as the potential target of luteolin than 30% and 0.18, The oral bioavailability and drug-likeness of luteolin were greater respectively (Supplementary Table S1), which indicated that luteolin had a good drug-likeness [31,32]. To further study the pharmacological effects of luteolin, the TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, and PharmMapper databases were used to discern the targets of the constituents of the drug. A total of 169 predicted target genes of luteolin were identiﬁed by screening and further veriﬁed (Supplementary Table S2). Next, the GeneCards, DrugBank, OMIM, PharmGkb, and TTD databases were used to ﬁnd MIRI-related target genes, and a total of 3176 genes were identiﬁed (Fig. 2A). There were 104 overlapping genes between luteolin-related target genes and MIRI-related ones, and this was considered to be the possible target set for luteolin in MIRI treatment (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S3). The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted to investigate the biological function of the 104 common target genes shared by luteolin and MIRI. GO analysis yielded a total of 1749 biological processes (BPs), 55 cell components (CCs), and 153 molecular functions (MFs). The top ﬁve markedly enriched BPs, P. Zhai, X.H. Ouyang, M.L. Yang et al.

The target genes for ‘‘response to oxidative stress” were the most enriched gene sets among all the target genes. To ascertain the potential signaling pathways involved in luteolin-mediated protection in MIRI, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was used to scrutinize the top 20 signaling pathways (Fig. 2D).

Ouyang, M.L. Yang et al. Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 and p53 signaling pathways were the most related to cell death. Therefore, we hypothesized that luteolin may manifest cardioprotective properties by attenuating oxidative stress or apoptosis. To assess the interplay between luteolin and MIRI common targets, the PPI network analysis was performed. The cohort of 104 shared targets were imported into the STRING 11.5 database, and a combined score (cid:4) 0.9 was set as the threshold. The network comprises 85 nodes interconnected by 261 edges, yielding an average degree of 6.14. The AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), heat shock protein 90 a family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), RELA protooncogene (RELA), and tumor protein p53 (TP53), were strongly connected to others (Fig. 2E and Supplementary ﬁgure S2). Then, the PPI network was imported into the Cytoscape, and topology analysis was used to identify the hub targets from these interacting proteins. Nine hub targets were screened, namely AKT1, HSP90AA1, MAPK1, MAPK14, RELA, TP53, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), SRC protooncogene (SRC), and RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) (Fig. 2F). Next, a luteolin-MIRI-target-GO-KEGG pathway network was constructed (Fig. 3). The targets were ranked from highest to lowest based on the degree of the network topology analysis parameters. TP53, MAPK1, RELA, AKT1, HSP90AA1, interferon c (IFNG), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), and prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) had the highest scores. The intersection of these 10 targets with the nine hub genes obtained from the PPI analysis (Fig. 2F) yielded ﬁve key genes, namely TP53, HSP90AA1, AKT1, MAPK1, and RELA. Previous investigations have indicated that luteolin mitigates myocardial damage through regulating the phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K)-AKT , MAPK , and nuclear factor-jB (NFjB) pathways [17,25]; however, whether luteolin can regulate p53 and HSP90 pathways to prevent MIRI has not yet been studied. Moreover, the p53 signaling cascade emerged as a pivotal pathway in the KEGG assessment of luteolin intervention in MIRI (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the p53 pathway was selected for further investigation. 3.3. Luteolin alleviated myocardial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress caused by MIRI To evaluate the biological activity and the binding afﬁnity of luteolin to p53 protein, molecular docking analysis was performed. Luteolin has multiple possible binding sites with p53, with the lowest binding energy being –5.4 kcal/mol, indicating an excellent strong afﬁnity between luteolin and p53 (Fig. 4A). Mdm2 is a pivotal protein within the intricate framework of the p53 signaling pathway. Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation while restraining transcriptional activity. The levels of mRNA for p53 and Mdm2 within the ischemia/reperfusion cardiac tissue were markedly elevated in comparison to those in the sham group. However, following luteolin administration, there was a decline in p53 mRNA expression juxtaposed with an escalation in Mdm2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4B). A similar tendency was detected in the protein level, with a notable increase in the expression of nuclear protein p-p53 observed in the IR group. Conversely, luteolin treatment decreased the expression of p-p53 (Fig. 4C). These data illustrated that luteolin had facilitated the upregulation of Mdm2 and had suppressed the production of p53, whether at the protein or mRNA level. This implied that luteolin had protected against myocardial injury by impeding the p53 pathway. Fig. 3. The luteolin-MIRI-target-GO-KEGG pathway network.

Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 Based on the GO and KEGG analyses, it is suggested that the regulation of apoptosis and oxidative stress potentially serves as the dominant mechanisms through which luteolin exerts its cardioprotective effects. The upregulation of Bax and cleaved Casp3 was noted in the IR group relative to the sham group. After luteolin administration, there was a notable increase in Bcl2 expression and the Bcl2/Bax ratio, while the expression of cleaved Casp3 protein was lower than in the IR group (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the quantity of TUNEL+ cells in the myocardial tissue was markedly diminished in the IL group when compared to the IR group, indicating that luteolin prevented myocardial apoptosis caused by MIRI (Fig. 4E and 4G). The ﬂuorescence intensity indicated that the intracellular superoxide level was diminished in the IL group compared with the IR group (Fig. 4F and 4H). Additionally, luteolin treatment reduced MDA levels that were elevated by ischemia/reperfusion, and increased activities of GSH and SOD that were reduced by ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 4I). These observations indicated that luteolin mitigated the oxidative stress in myocardial tissue that was caused by MIRI. 3.4. Luteolin mitigated HR-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress responses through regulating p53 in vitro The effect of luteolin on the survival of HL1 cells under normal oxygen conditions was assessed. Luteolin of 5, 10, and 20 lmol/L exhibited negligible inﬂuence on HL1 cells compared to the normal control group (Supplementary ﬁgure S3A). Then, the therapeutic effect of luteolin on HL1 cells incubated with HR was evaluated, revealing that luteolin augments HL1 cell viability in a dosedependent fashion (Supplementary ﬁgure S3B). Next, the apoptotic cells underwent analysis through Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The proportion of apoptotic cells in the HR + luteolin group markedly decreased compared to that of the HR group, indicating that luteolin alleviated HR-induced apoptosis of HL1 cells. However, the efﬁcacy of luteolin in reducing HR-induced apoptosis was reversed after administration of NSC319726, an agonist of p53 (Fig. 5A), indicating that luteolin exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting p53. Luteolin decreased the expression of HR-mediated p53 and pp53 proteins, as well as the apoptosis related proteins, Bax and luteolin administration cleaved Casp3 (Fig. 5B). increased the level of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl2, as well as the Bcl2/Bax ratio (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the NSC319726 intervention upregulated apoptosis-related proteins. The analysis of JC-1 ﬂuorescence staining and ﬂow cytometry revealed that HR treatment leads to a relative increase in JC-1 monomers compared to aggregates (Fig. 5D and 5E), and treatment with luteolin resulted in a reduced HR-induced monomer content relative to the JC-1 aggregate content. Notably, the addition of the p53 agonist reversed the beneﬁcial effects of luteolin (Fig. 5F). These observations strongly suggested that luteolin effectively ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction induced by HR through p53. In addition, The ﬂow cytometry analysis showed that luteolin reversed HRmediated upregulation of DCF expression, which indicated that luteolin suppressed the oxidative stress response in MIRI (Fig. 5G). In addition, luteolin reversed the heightened ﬂuorescence intensity of DHE induced by HR. The p53 activator NSC319726 induced an increase in the concentration of DHE+ cells, despite the intervention with luteolin (Fig. 5H and 5I). Furthermore, the HR group exhibited greater levels of oxidative stress, and luteolin successfully mitigated this stress, as shown by the decreased MDA content and the restoration of GSH and SOD activities (Fig. 5J). These ﬁndings show that luteolin alleviated the oxidative stress caused by HR. However, when using the p53 activator, the ability of luteolin to combat oxidative stress was diminished. These results establish that luteolin exerts its anti-apoptotic and antioxidative stress properties by speciﬁcally targeting p53. 3.5. Luteolin exerted a cardioprotective effect on MIRI mice by modulating the p53 pathway To determine whether luteolin could protect cardiomyocyte from MIRI by regulating the p53 pathway, we treated MIRI mice with the p53 agonist, NSC319726, and the p53 inhibitor, piﬁthrin-a, and evaluated the extent of infarction, myocardial enzyme levels, and cardiac functionality in mouse hearts. The outcomes of Evans blue/TTC dual staining showed a notably larger myocardial infarction zone within the ILN group in contrast to the IL group. Additionally, the infarct region in the IPa group exhibited a notable reduction relative to the IR group, and the difference between infarct area in the IL and IPa groups was not signiﬁcant (Fig. 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the serum concentrations of CK, CK-MB, and cTnI showed a decline after the administration of luteolin or piﬁthrin-a. However, the addition of NSC319726 resulted in weakening of luteolin’s ability to reduce myocardial enzymes (Fig. 6C). Mice from the IL group or the IPa group showed signiﬁcant improvements in LVEF, LVFS, LVIDd, and LVIDs, compared to the IR group. Moreover, the administration of NSC319726 resulted in an augmentation of LVIDd and LVIDs, alongside a decrease in LVEF and LVFS, thereby inducing a decline in cardiac systolic function, compared to the IL group. Furthermore, administration of piﬁthrin-a showed no signiﬁcant difference compared to luteolin treatment (Fig. 6D and 6E). In terms of assessing cardiac diastolic function, we observed that NSC319726, piﬁthrin-a, and luteolin had no notable effects on the mitral valve, the ratio of E/A, or the deceleration time of the E-wave (Supplementary ﬁgure S4). Taken together, these data showed that luteolin improved the cardiac dysfunction in MIRI mice by mediating the p53 pathway. 4. Discussion Luteolin is a promising agent for alleviating pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction through its powerful anti-apoptosis and antioxidant effects. The function of luteolin in MIRI and its potential mechanism remain not yet fully clariﬁed. In this study, luteolin was shown to diminish myocardial infarction size and myocardial enzymes and to reinstate myocardial contractile capacity in mice, conﬁrming the therapeutic effectiveness of luteolin on MIRI. Cardiomyocytes are rich in mitochondria . MIRI can impair mitochondrial function, subsequently affecting the energy metabolism and redox homeostasis of cardiomyocytes, while also leading to excessive generation of ROS [36,37]. Previous studies have suggested that luteolin can inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondrial toxins , restore mitochondrial membrane potential, preserve overall mitochondrial function, and alleviate oxidative stress in Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, luteolin was also found to attenuate the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential elevation caused by HR in HL1 cells and mitigate the excess ROS and the intense oxidative stress response. Network pharmacological analysis showed that p53 served as a hub target for luteolin in mitigating MIRI. Molecular docking investigations further illustrated that luteolin exhibited a pronounced afﬁnity for p53 binding. Normally, p53 is localized in the cytoplasm of mouse cardiomyocytes; however, under HR condition, p53 expression was markedly elevated and translocated to the nucleus , impacting myocardial systolic function . Inhibiting the upregulation and nuclear translocation of p53 was shown to significantly reduce apoptosis in anoxic and reoxygenated cardiomyocytes indeed induced In our experiments, MIRI cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ROS production and concurrently increased the expression and phosphorylation of p53. Luteolin was able to suppress the expression and phosphorylation of p53, [40,41]. 660 P. Zhai, X.H. Ouyang, M.L. Yang et al. Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 Fig. 5.

However, when a p53 agonist was administered, the cardioprotective effect of luteolin diminished, indicating that the target of luteolin’s cardio-protection is p53. Luteolin had a protective effect when used to treat endometritis through its inhibition of the activation or phosphorylation of p53 . Moreover, luteolin attenuated p53 induced apoptosis in hepatic tissue , obesity , and heart failure ailments . However, conﬂicting results have been observed in human colon cancer, where luteolin promoted and activated p53 expression [46,47]. This may be attributed to disease or tissue speciﬁcity, drug administration, and biological complexity. Our results showed that luteolin suppressed p-p53 activation by reducing p53 expression and accumulation, leading to a decrease in MIRI, aligning with the results of other studies investigating non-tumor diseases. p53 induces cell apoptosis by regulating Bax, Bcl2, phorbol-12myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 expression [48,49]. The excessive activation of the p53 pathway initiates a cascade of ROS related gene activations [50,51]. p-p53 can also suppress the transcription of antioxidant genes . Furthermore, oxidative stress can facilitate cellular apoptosis . Upon ROS stimulation, p53 protein was translocalized to the mitochondrial membrane and facilitated the accelerated opening of membrane pores, leading to a decrease in membrane potential, and exacerbation of the malignant loop of mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, and cellular apoptosis . In our study, luteolin treatment reduced apoptosis and ROS level in myocardium with MIRI, accompanied by the decrease of p53. When the p53 agonist was added, luteolin’s ability to reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress was diminished; further, the p53 inhibitor exerted a similar 661 P. Zhai, X.H. Ouyang, M.L. Yang et al.

Journal of Integrative Medicine 22 (2024) 652–664 mitigation of apoptosis and oxidative stress as luteolin, suggesting that the p53 pathway serves as a crucial route through which luteolin mitigates apoptosis and oxidative stress in myocardial cells. Nevertheless, the precise regulatory effects of luteolin on p53 subunits remain to be further elucidated. For instance, integrating molecular dynamics simulations with mutation analyses to sequentially alter luteolin’s binding sites on the p53 protein substructure could provide deeper insights into the mechanistic role of luteolin with respect to p53. Moreover, the manner by which luteolin improves mitochondrial oxidative stress via the p53 signaling pathway still requires clariﬁcation, including whether it acts through mitochondrial membrane fusion and ﬁssion or through cellular energy metabolism. To this end, elucidating luteolin’s mechanisms through mitochondrial function assessments, gene expression analyses, and proteomics studies would lay a scientiﬁc foundation for its application in treating cardiovascular disorders. This study suggests that luteolin can reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress by suppressing p53 expression, thus alleviating myocardial damage in MIRI (Fig. 7). However, the speciﬁc regulation of the p53 protein subunit by luteolin remains to be further conﬁrmed. Whether luteolin affects other downstream signaling pathways after modulating the p53 signaling pathway also needs to be further investigated. 5. Conclusion This study investigated the therapeutic efﬁcacy and fundamental mechanism of luteolin on MIRI. Luteolin shielded mice from MIRI, as indicated by the decreased myocardial infarct size and myocardial enzyme levels and augmented systolic function. The results of in vivo and in vitro experiments show that luteolin diminished p53 expression and impeded nuclear translocation of p-p53, thereby averting ROS generation and reducing cellular apoptosis. It is suggested that luteolin mitigated cellular apoptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting phosphorylation of p53 to alleviate MIRI. This study validates luteolin’s potential as a natural drug for MIRI therapy.
