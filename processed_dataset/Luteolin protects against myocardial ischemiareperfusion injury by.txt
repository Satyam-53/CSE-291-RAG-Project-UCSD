Objective: Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is an obstacle to the success of cardiac reperfu-
sion therapy. This study explores whether luteolin can mitigate MIRI by regulating the p53 signaling
pathway.
Methods: Model mice were subjected to a temporary surgical ligation of the left anterior descending
coronary artery, and administered luteolin. The myocardial infarct size, myocardial enzyme levels, and
cardiac function were measured. Latent targets and signaling pathways were screened using network
pharmacology and molecular docking. Then, proteins related to the p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis
and oxidative stress were measured. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-incubated HL1 cells were used to val-
idate the effects of luteolin in vitro. In addition, a p53 agonist and an inhibitor were used to investigate
the mechanism.
Results: Luteolin reduced the myocardial infarcted size and myocardial enzymes, and restored cardiac
function in MIRI mice. Network pharmacology identiﬁed p53 as a hub target. The bioinformatic analyses
showed that luteolin had anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties. Additionally, luteolin halted the
activation of p53, and prevented both apoptosis and oxidative stress in myocardial tissue in vivo.
Furthermore, luteolin inhibited cell apoptosis, JC-1 monomer formation, and reactive oxygen species ele-
vation in HR-incubated HL1 cells in vitro. Finally, the p53 agonist NSC319726 downregulated the protec-
tive attributes of luteolin in the MIRI mouse model, and both luteolin and the p53 inhibitor piﬁthrin-a
demonstrated a similar therapeutic effect in the MIRI mice.
Conclusion: Luteolin effectively treats MIRI and may ameliorate myocardial damage by regulating apop-
tosis and oxidative stress through its targeting of the p53 signaling pathway.

Acute myocardial infarction is a prevalent cardiovascular condi-
tion characterized by signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality on a glo-
bal scale [1]. Revascularization therapy has become the standard
treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction [2], which

may however lead to myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury
(MIRI) [3,4]. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is an important
mechanism of MIRI, which may impair myocardial function. How-
ever, drugs aimed at mitigating myocardial cell apoptosis and their
potential mechanisms necessitate further study [5].

Luteolin, also known as 30,40,5,7-tetrahydroxy ﬂavone, is pri-
marily sourced from fruits, vegetables, and edible parts of various
plants [6]. Luteolin has antioxidative, anticancer, antimicrobial,
antidiabetic, anti-inﬂammatory, and neuroprotective properties,
making it widely beneﬁcial in the management of various ailments
[7]. As an anticancer agent it has been shown to induce apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest [6]. It can also inhibit nuclear factor-E2 like
bZIP transcription factor 2 to promote the expression of heme oxy-
genase 1, thereby exerting signiﬁcant protective effects during
oxidative stress [8]. Currently, the attention to the luteolin’s appli-
cation in cardiovascular diseases is gradually gaining [9,10]. Previ-
ous studies have demonstrated that luteolin can reduce the
mortality rate among individuals suffering from coronary heart
disease, as well as ameliorate myocardial damage [11–14]. How-
ever, the underlying mechanism through which luteolin exerts
its cardioprotective effect in MIRI is not yet known.

luteolin’s

to measure

To investigate the mechanism by which luteolin exerts its car-
dioprotective effects, we performed in vitro and in vivo experi-
ments
on the
phosphorylation of p53 and its ability to protect cardiomyocytes
from ischemia/reperfusion injury. This research emphasizes the
cardioprotective role of luteolin in mitigating myocardial injury
through the inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and oxidative
stress.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials

Luteolin (purity > 98%; CAS: 491-70-3) and NSC319726 (pu-
rity > 95%; CAS: 71555-25-4) were purchased from Shanghai Alad-
din Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Piﬁthrin-a
(purity > 98%, CAS: 60477-38-5) was purchased from Shanghai
Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Lute-
olin, NSC319726, and piﬁthrin-a were dissolved in dimethyl sul-
foxide (DMSO) and subsequently mixed with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) to achieve a ﬁnal solution with a DMSO concentration
below 0.01%.

2.2. Animals

This study used 8 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice (Beijing Vital
River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) that
had been raised in a speciﬁc-pathogen-free environment with tem-
perature at (24 ± 2) ℃ and humidity at 55% ± 10% and subjected to
a 12 h day/night cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All
animal study procedures were conducted in strict accordance with
the guidelines set forth by the Animal Research Institute Commit-
tee, as sanctioned by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology
(ethical approval no. 3554).

Mice were divided according to a random number table
method into the sham group, sham + luteolin (SL) group, ische-
mia/reperfusion model (IR) group, and ischemia/reperfusion +
luteolin (IL) group. Each group had six mice. The dosage and
administration of luteolin in this study followed the methods of
previous studies [15–18]. The dose was calculated according to
recommended daily intake for humans [19] and modiﬁed for
mouse physiology. The IL group was given luteolin at 10 mg/

653

(kg∙d) for 7 d before ischemia/reperfusion surgery and for another
3 d after the surgery. The sham group underwent thoracotomy
without coronary artery ligation. The IR group underwent thora-
cotomy and coronary artery ligation. The SL group was adminis-
tered the same dosage and duration of luteolin as in the IL
group without undergoing coronary artery ligation.
In the
ischemia/reperfusion + luteolin + NSC319726 (ILN) group,
NSC319726 at a dose of 10 mg/(kg∙d) was administrated from
3 d before the ischemia/reperfusion surgery and continued until
3 d after the surgery. In the ischemia/reperfusion + piﬁthrin-a
(IPa) group, piﬁthrin-a (1.1 mg/kg) was administered intraperi-
toneally every other day, commencing on the 7th day before sur-
gery and was continued until the 3rd day after surgery.

2.3. Establishment of the mouse model of MIRI

Myocardial

ischemia/reperfusion surgery was performed
according to the experimental model guidelines for myocardial
ischemia and infarction [20]. The mice were injected with pento-
barbital (1%, 40 mg/kg) for anesthesia, restrained in a supine posi-
tion and ventilated at a respiratory rate of 110 times/min. The
mouse chest movements were then monitored to assess breath-
ing and conﬁrm successful intubation. Following meticulous hair
removal and sterilization of the surgical area, the thoracotomy
was performed to visualize the heart. The left anterior descending
coronary artery was ligated with sutures under a microscope and
the slipknot was opened 30 min later. After the mice woke up,
they were taken off the ventilator and received focused care for
3 d.

2.4. Myocardial infarction area detection

After euthanizing the mice 3 d post-ischemia/reperfusion sur-
gery, Evans blue (3%, 1 mL) was injected into the inferior vena cava.
The hearts of the mice were excised, frozen, uniformly sectioned
along the longitudinal axis into ﬁve slices (approximately
2.5 mm in thickness), and sequentially stained with 2% 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 ℃ for 20 min; subse-
quently they were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,
and photographed. In the stained results, blue indicates the pres-
ence of healthy myocardial tissue, red represents the area at risk,
and white represents the infarcted region. The areas were mea-
sured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.,
Rockville, MD, USA) with the percentage of the infarcted area rep-
resented as the proportion of the white region to the total heart
section area.

2.5. Echocardiography

The cardiac functions of mice were assessed using M-mode
echocardiography with a Vevo 2100 Imaging System (FUJIFILM
VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). Two-dimensional targeted
M-mode traces were recorded from the parasternal short-axis
view at the mid-papillary muscle level and from the parasternal
long-axis view below the papillary muscle. A minimum of six con-
secutive cardiac cycles were obtained. The left ventricular systolic
diameter (LVIDs), left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVIDd), left
ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular
end systolic volume (LVESV) were assessed. The velocities of early
diastolic ﬁlling peak (E-wave) and late diastolic ﬁlling peak (A-
wave) of mitral valve blood ﬂow were also examined, along with
the E-wave deceleration time (DT). The E/A ratio was the ratio of
the E-wave velocity to the A-wave velocity. The left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) and the left ventricular fractional shorten-
ing (LVFS) were calculated as:

2.6. Detection of myocardial enzymes and oxidative stress indicators

Blood samples were collected 1 d post-ischemia/reperfusion
surgery and centrifuged to retain the serum. Serum creatine kinase
(CK) and CK muscle/brain subtype (CK-MB) were detected using a
CK assay kit (A032-1-1) and CK-MB isoenzyme assay kit (E006-1-
1), respectively, from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute
(Nanjing, China). The level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was assessed
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SEKM-0153,
Solarbio, Inc., Beijing, China). Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) were analyzed using assay
kits (A003-1-1, A001-3-2, and A006-2-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Bio-
engineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The detections were con-
ducted following the manufacturers’ guidelines.

2.7. Prediction of luteolin and MIRI-related target genes

The molecular conﬁguration and simpliﬁed molecular input line
entry speciﬁcation of luteolin were acquired from the PubChem
database
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/442428)
[21]. Information on targets associated with luteolin was gathered
through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology
SwissTargetPrediction
(TCMSP,
(https://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) [22], and PharmMapper
(https://lilab-ecust.cn/pharmmapper/index.html) databases. Tar-
get designations were standardized through the UniProt database
(https://www.uniprot.org/) [23].

https://www.tcmsp-e.com/),

MIRI-associated target genes were compiled from GeneCard
(https://www.genecards.org/), Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM, https://omim.org/search/advanced/geneMap) [24],
Pharmacogenetics
and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base
(PharmGkb, https://www.pharmgkb.org/), Therapeutic Target
Database (TTD, https://idrblab.net) [25], and DrugBank (https://
go.drugbank.com/) [26]. The intersection between luteolin and
MIRI-associated targets was visualized with Venny online tool
(https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html) [27].

2.8. Protein-protein interaction network analysis, and molecular
docking

‘‘DOSE,”

‘‘clusterProﬁler,”

The analysis of biofunction properties through Gene Ontology
(GO) and the exploration of molecular pathway via the Kyoto Ency-
clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were conducted using
packages for the R statistical language environment including
‘‘org.hs.eg.db,”
‘‘Enrichment plot,”
‘‘GGplot2,” and ‘‘Pathview.” The network depicting protein–protein
interaction (PPI) among targets was acquired via the Search Tool
for The Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) 11.5
(https://string-db.org/) [28]. The visualization of the PPI network
was produced using Cytoscape 3.9.1 (Cytoscape Consortium, San
Diego, CA, USA) [29]. NetworkAnalyzer and CytoNCA plug-ins were
used for topological investigation of the PPI network. The 2D struc-
ture of luteolin was procured from the PubChem database (https://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and transmuted into a 3D structure
utilizing ChemBio3D Ultra 14.0 (CambridgeSoft, Inc., Cambridge,
MA, USA). Molecular docking was conducted with AutoDock Vina
v.1.2.0 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) [30].

2.9. Western blotting analysis

To extract the nuclear proteins, the nuclear and cytoplasmic
protein extraction kit (P0027, Beyotime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai,
China) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The right ventricular tissue was isolated and lysed with radioim-
munoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuo-
ride, and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO,
USA). The protein content was measured with a bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay kit (P0010, Beyotime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai,
China). Lysates were separated electrophoretically on a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore Cor-
poration, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked with
5% skimmed milk (232100, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 1 h, fol-
lowed by overnight incubation at 4 ℃ with the following primary
antibodies: 1:1000 p53 (A5761), 1:1000 murine double minute 2

pase 3 (Casp3, A19654), and 1:1000 cleaved Casp3 (A22869) from
ABclonal, Inc. (Woburn, MA, USA), 1:1000 B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2,
TU323153s), 1:1000 Bcl-associated X protein (Bax, Tu333334s),
and 1:1000 phosphorylated p53 (p-p53) (Ser15, TP56395) from
Abmart Medicine Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and
1:1000 a-actin (23660–1-AP, Proteintech Group, Inc., Rosemont,
IL, USA). The membranes were washed in tris-buffered saline with
0.1% Tween (TBST) and immersed in the secondary antibody
(AS014, ABclonal, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temper-
ature. The membrane was washed again with TBST and then sub-
jected to enhanced chemiluminescence liquid (G3308, Gbcbio
Technologies, Inc., Guangzhou, China) and visualized using the
iBrightTM CL1500 Imaging System (A44114, Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).

2.10. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction

Total RNA from tissues and cells was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (ATG Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). RNA was
then prepared with SynScript(cid:3) Ⅲ RT SuperMix for quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (+gDNA remover, TSK314S)
and 2 (cid:3) TSINGKE(cid:3) Master qPCR Mix (SYBR Green Ⅰ, TSE201)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Tsingke Biotech Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China). The detection was conducted using the MA-
6000 real-time quantitative thermal cycler (Suzhou Molarray Co.,
Ltd., Suzhou, China). Relative RNA levels were analyzed with the
2–DDCt method and b-actin served as an internal benchmark. The
primers were listed in Table 1.

2.11. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
labeling assay

The one-step terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (E-CK-A320, Elabscience
Bionovation, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and dihydroethidium (DHE,
S0063S, Beyotime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai, China) were used, and
the detection was conducted following the manufacturers’
instructions.

2.12. Reactive oxygen species assays

The measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
in the myocardial tissues was conducted with DHE (S0063S, Bey-
otime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai, China). The myocardial tissues were
washed with PBS and then incubated with DHE (5 lmol/L) at 37 ℃
for 30 min. A ﬂuorescence microscope (BX50, Olympus Corpora-
tion, Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess ﬂuorescence intensity.

The ROS production in HL1 cells was measured with an ROS
assay kit (S0033S, Beyotime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai, China). HL1
cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with
the ﬂuorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA, 10 lmol/L) at 37 ℃ for 30 min. Cells were acquired
and analyzed using a CytoFLEXTM ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Brea, CA, USA).

2.13. Cell culture and cell viability analysis

The murine cardiac muscle cell line (HL1) was purchased from
Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (CL-06–5, Wuhan,
China). To establish the hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) model, HL1
cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions of 95% N2 + 5% CO2
for 12 h at 37 ℃. The cells were then relocated to a normoxic incu-
bation at 37 ℃ for 6 h of reoxygenation. The normal control group
was cultivated within a conventional incubator setting. In the
6-hour reoxygenation, the HR model group was incubated with
PBS, the HR + luteolin group was incubated with luteolin, and
the HR + luteolin + NSC group was incubated with 10 lmol/L
NSC319726.

The HL1 cells were nurtured in 96-well plates (1 (cid:3) 104 cells/
In brief, 10 lL Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent
well).
(GK10001, GlpBio Technology, Montclair, CA, USA) was added to
each well and incubated with cells for an extra 40 min. The absor-
bance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm with Inﬁnite(cid:3) F50
Plus microplate
Ltd., Männedorf,
Switzerland).

2.14. Cell apoptosis assay

Cell apoptosis was measured using ﬂow cytometry with the
Annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide
(PI) apoptosis kit (AP101, Lianke Biotech, Co., Ltd, Hangzhou,
China). Brieﬂy, the HL1 cells were collected after treatment, and
then rinsed with PBS for binding and staining. The cells were
examined under a CytoFLEXTM ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Brea, CA, USA).

2.15. JC-1 assay

5,50,6,60-Tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethylbenzimi-dazoylcarbo
cyanine iodide (JC-1) ﬂuorescence detection was conducted using
the JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit (C2006, Bey-
otime Biotech, Inc., Shanghai, China), followed by ﬂuorescence
imaging analysis using a ﬂuorescence microscope (BX50, Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Meanwhile, the JC-1 detection was also
conducted with ﬂow cytometry. The HL1 cells were stained with
JC-1 staining solution. Subsequently, the CytoFLEXTM ﬂow cytome-
ter was employed for ﬂuorescence analysis of the cells.

2.16. Statistical analysis

3. Results

3.1. Luteolin decreased myocardial infarction area and enzyme levels
and reinstated cardiac function after MIRI in vivo

To assess the therapeutic efﬁcacy of luteolin against MIRI, lute-
olin was administered to MIRI mice, and the myocardial enzymes,
myocardial infarct size, and cardiac contractility of mice were
examined. The size of infarcts in myocardial tissue was evaluated
using Evans blue and TTC dual staining. Fig. 1A and 1B illustrate
the reduction in the extent of infarctions within the IL group, com-
pared to the IR group. Serum CK, CK-MB, and cTnI levels were ele-
vated in the IR group relative to the sham group. Administration of
luteolin reduced serum CK, CK-MB, and cTnI concentrations in the
mice of the IL group compared to the IR group (Fig. 1C). The
echocardiographic ﬁndings revealed notable reductions in LVEF
and LVFS among the IR group in contrast to the sham group. Con-
versely, the IL group exhibited heightened levels of these two indi-
cators in contrast to the IR group, implying the restoration of
myocardial contractile power in mice subjected to ischemia/reper-
fusion injury (Fig. 1D and 1E). Luteolin also signiﬁcantly improved
LVIDd and LVIDs in the IR group (Fig. 1D and 1E), but did not
improve the E/A ratio or the DT of the mitral valve (Supplementary
ﬁgure S1). In contrast with the sham group, the provision of lute-
olin to mice subjected to the sham operation did not induce any
modiﬁcation in the area of the infarct, cardiac enzymes, or cardiac
function, indicating that luteolin did not have signiﬁcant toxic side
effects in the mice (Fig. 1). Collectively, these ﬁndings showed that
luteolin exerts a protective function in MIRI.

3.2. p53 was identiﬁed as the potential target of luteolin

than 30% and 0.18,

The oral bioavailability and drug-likeness of luteolin were
greater
respectively (Supplementary
Table S1), which indicated that luteolin had a good drug-likeness
[31,32]. To further study the pharmacological effects of luteolin,
the TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, and PharmMapper databases
were used to discern the targets of the constituents of the drug.
A total of 169 predicted target genes of luteolin were identiﬁed
by screening and further veriﬁed (Supplementary Table S2). Next,
the GeneCards, DrugBank, OMIM, PharmGkb, and TTD databases
were used to ﬁnd MIRI-related target genes, and a total of 3176
genes were identiﬁed (Fig. 2A). There were 104 overlapping genes
between luteolin-related target genes and MIRI-related ones, and
this was considered to be the possible target set for luteolin in MIRI
treatment (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S3).

The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted to
investigate the biological function of the 104 common target genes
shared by luteolin and MIRI. GO analysis yielded a total of 1749
biological processes (BPs), 55 cell components (CCs), and 153
molecular functions (MFs). The top ﬁve markedly enriched BPs,

and p53 signaling pathways were the most related to cell death.
Therefore, we hypothesized that luteolin may manifest cardiopro-
tective properties by attenuating oxidative stress or apoptosis.

To assess the interplay between luteolin and MIRI common tar-
gets, the PPI network analysis was performed. The cohort of 104
shared targets were imported into the STRING 11.5 database, and
a combined score (cid:4) 0.9 was set as the threshold. The network com-
prises 85 nodes interconnected by 261 edges, yielding an average
degree of 6.14. The AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), heat
shock protein 90 a family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1),
mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), RELA proto-
oncogene (RELA), and tumor protein p53 (TP53), were strongly con-
nected to others (Fig. 2E and Supplementary ﬁgure S2). Then, the
PPI network was imported into the Cytoscape, and topology anal-
ysis was used to identify the hub targets from these interacting
proteins. Nine hub targets were screened, namely AKT1, HSP90AA1,
MAPK1, MAPK14, RELA, TP53, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), SRC proto-
oncogene (SRC), and RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1)
(Fig. 2F).

Next, a luteolin-MIRI-target-GO-KEGG pathway network was
constructed (Fig. 3). The targets were ranked from highest to low-
est based on the degree of the network topology analysis parame-
ters. TP53, MAPK1, RELA, AKT1, HSP90AA1, interferon c (IFNG),
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), and prostaglandin-
endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) had the highest scores. The inter-
section of these 10 targets with the nine hub genes obtained from
the PPI analysis (Fig. 2F) yielded ﬁve key genes, namely TP53,
HSP90AA1, AKT1, MAPK1, and RELA.

Previous investigations have indicated that luteolin mitigates
myocardial damage through regulating the phosphoinositide-3-

kinase (PI3K)-AKT [33], MAPK [12], and nuclear factor-jB (NF-
jB) pathways [17,25]; however, whether luteolin can regulate
p53 and HSP90 pathways to prevent MIRI has not yet been studied.
Moreover, the p53 signaling cascade emerged as a pivotal pathway
in the KEGG assessment of luteolin intervention in MIRI (Fig. 2D).
Therefore, the p53 pathway was selected for further investigation.

3.3. Luteolin alleviated myocardial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress
caused by MIRI

To evaluate the biological activity and the binding afﬁnity of
luteolin to p53 protein, molecular docking analysis was performed.
Luteolin has multiple possible binding sites with p53, with the
lowest binding energy being –5.4 kcal/mol, indicating an excellent
strong afﬁnity between luteolin and p53 (Fig. 4A). Mdm2 is a piv-
otal protein within the intricate framework of the p53 signaling
pathway. Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation while restraining tran-
scriptional activity. The levels of mRNA for p53 and Mdm2 within
the ischemia/reperfusion cardiac tissue were markedly elevated
in comparison to those in the sham group. However, following
luteolin administration, there was a decline in p53 mRNA expres-
sion juxtaposed with an escalation in Mdm2 mRNA expression
(Fig. 4B). A similar tendency was detected in the protein level, with
a notable increase in the expression of nuclear protein p-p53
observed in the IR group. Conversely, luteolin treatment decreased
the expression of p-p53 (Fig. 4C). These data illustrated that lute-
olin had facilitated the upregulation of Mdm2 and had suppressed
the production of p53, whether at the protein or mRNA level. This
implied that luteolin had protected against myocardial injury by
impeding the p53 pathway.

Based on the GO and KEGG analyses, it is suggested that the reg-
ulation of apoptosis and oxidative stress potentially serves as the
dominant mechanisms through which luteolin exerts its cardio-
protective effects. The upregulation of Bax and cleaved Casp3
was noted in the IR group relative to the sham group. After luteolin
administration, there was a notable increase in Bcl2 expression and
the Bcl2/Bax ratio, while the expression of cleaved Casp3 protein
was lower than in the IR group (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the quantity
of TUNEL+ cells in the myocardial tissue was markedly diminished
in the IL group when compared to the IR group, indicating that
luteolin prevented myocardial apoptosis caused by MIRI (Fig. 4E
and 4G). The ﬂuorescence intensity indicated that the intracellular
superoxide level was diminished in the IL group compared with
the IR group (Fig. 4F and 4H). Additionally, luteolin treatment
reduced MDA levels that were elevated by ischemia/reperfusion,
and increased activities of GSH and SOD that were reduced by
ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 4I). These observations indicated that
luteolin mitigated the oxidative stress in myocardial tissue that
was caused by MIRI.

3.4. Luteolin mitigated HR-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress
responses through regulating p53 in vitro

The effect of luteolin on the survival of HL1 cells under normal
oxygen conditions was assessed. Luteolin of 5, 10, and 20 lmol/L
exhibited negligible inﬂuence on HL1 cells compared to the normal
control group (Supplementary ﬁgure S3A). Then, the therapeutic
effect of luteolin on HL1 cells incubated with HR was evaluated,
revealing that luteolin augments HL1 cell viability in a dose-
dependent fashion (Supplementary ﬁgure S3B). Next, the apoptotic
cells underwent analysis through Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The
proportion of apoptotic cells in the HR + luteolin group markedly
decreased compared to that of the HR group, indicating that lute-
olin alleviated HR-induced apoptosis of HL1 cells. However, the
efﬁcacy of luteolin in reducing HR-induced apoptosis was reversed
after administration of NSC319726, an agonist of p53 (Fig. 5A),
indicating that luteolin exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting
p53. Luteolin decreased the expression of HR-mediated p53 and p-
p53 proteins, as well as the apoptosis related proteins, Bax and
luteolin administration
cleaved Casp3 (Fig. 5B).
increased the level of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl2, as well as the
Bcl2/Bax ratio (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, the NSC319726 intervention
upregulated apoptosis-related proteins. The analysis of JC-1 ﬂuo-
rescence staining and ﬂow cytometry revealed that HR treatment
leads to a relative increase in JC-1 monomers compared to aggre-
gates (Fig. 5D and 5E), and treatment with luteolin resulted in a
reduced HR-induced monomer content relative to the JC-1 aggre-
gate content. Notably, the addition of the p53 agonist reversed
the beneﬁcial effects of luteolin (Fig. 5F). These observations
strongly suggested that luteolin effectively ameliorates mitochon-
drial dysfunction induced by HR through p53.

In addition,

The ﬂow cytometry analysis showed that luteolin reversed HR-
mediated upregulation of DCF expression, which indicated that
luteolin suppressed the oxidative stress
response in MIRI
(Fig. 5G). In addition, luteolin reversed the heightened ﬂuorescence
intensity of DHE induced by HR. The p53 activator NSC319726
induced an increase in the concentration of DHE+ cells, despite
the intervention with luteolin (Fig. 5H and 5I). Furthermore, the
HR group exhibited greater levels of oxidative stress, and luteolin
successfully mitigated this stress, as shown by the decreased
MDA content and the restoration of GSH and SOD activities
(Fig. 5J). These ﬁndings show that luteolin alleviated the oxidative
stress caused by HR. However, when using the p53 activator, the
ability of luteolin to combat oxidative stress was diminished. These
results establish that luteolin exerts its anti-apoptotic and anti-
oxidative stress properties by speciﬁcally targeting p53.

3.5. Luteolin exerted a cardioprotective effect on MIRI mice by
modulating the p53 pathway

To determine whether luteolin could protect cardiomyocyte
from MIRI by regulating the p53 pathway, we treated MIRI mice
with the p53 agonist, NSC319726, and the p53 inhibitor,
piﬁthrin-a, and evaluated the extent of infarction, myocardial
enzyme levels, and cardiac functionality in mouse hearts. The out-
comes of Evans blue/TTC dual staining showed a notably larger
myocardial infarction zone within the ILN group in contrast to
the IL group. Additionally, the infarct region in the IPa group exhib-
ited a notable reduction relative to the IR group, and the difference
between infarct area in the IL and IPa groups was not signiﬁcant
(Fig. 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the serum concentrations of CK,
CK-MB, and cTnI showed a decline after the administration of lute-
olin or piﬁthrin-a. However, the addition of NSC319726 resulted in
weakening of luteolin’s ability to reduce myocardial enzymes
(Fig. 6C). Mice from the IL group or the IPa group showed signiﬁ-
cant improvements in LVEF, LVFS, LVIDd, and LVIDs, compared to
the IR group. Moreover, the administration of NSC319726 resulted
in an augmentation of LVIDd and LVIDs, alongside a decrease in
LVEF and LVFS, thereby inducing a decline in cardiac systolic func-
tion, compared to the IL group. Furthermore, administration of
piﬁthrin-a showed no signiﬁcant difference compared to luteolin
treatment (Fig. 6D and 6E). In terms of assessing cardiac diastolic
function, we observed that NSC319726, piﬁthrin-a, and luteolin
had no notable effects on the mitral valve, the ratio of E/A, or the
deceleration time of the E-wave (Supplementary ﬁgure S4). Taken
together, these data showed that luteolin improved the cardiac
dysfunction in MIRI mice by mediating the p53 pathway.

4. Discussion

Luteolin is a promising agent for alleviating pathological cardiac
hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction [34] through its powerful
anti-apoptosis [9] and antioxidant [16] effects. The function of
luteolin in MIRI and its potential mechanism remain not yet fully
clariﬁed. In this study, luteolin was shown to diminish myocardial
infarction size and myocardial enzymes and to reinstate myocar-
dial contractile capacity in mice, conﬁrming the therapeutic effec-
tiveness of luteolin on MIRI.

Cardiomyocytes are rich in mitochondria [35]. MIRI can impair
mitochondrial function, subsequently affecting the energy metabo-
lism and redox homeostasis of cardiomyocytes, while also leading
to excessive generation of ROS [36,37]. Previous studies have sug-
gested that luteolin can inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction induced
by mitochondrial toxins [38], restore mitochondrial membrane
potential, preserve overall mitochondrial function, and alleviate
oxidative stress [39] in Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, luteolin
was also found to attenuate the increase in mitochondrial mem-
brane potential elevation caused by HR in HL1 cells and mitigate
the excess ROS and the intense oxidative stress response.

Network pharmacological analysis showed that p53 served as a
hub target for luteolin in mitigating MIRI. Molecular docking inves-
tigations further illustrated that luteolin exhibited a pronounced
afﬁnity for p53 binding. Normally, p53 is localized in the cytoplasm
of mouse cardiomyocytes; however, under HR condition, p53
expression was markedly elevated and translocated to the nucleus
[40], impacting myocardial systolic function [5]. Inhibiting the
upregulation and nuclear translocation of p53 was shown to signif-
icantly reduce apoptosis in anoxic and reoxygenated cardiomy-
ocytes
indeed induced
In our experiments, MIRI
cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ROS production and concurrently
increased the expression and phosphorylation of p53. Luteolin
was able to suppress the expression and phosphorylation of p53,

thereby reducing myocardial infarction area and enzymes, and
restoring cardiac contractility. However, when a p53 agonist was
administered, the cardioprotective effect of luteolin diminished,
indicating that the target of luteolin’s cardio-protection is p53.

Luteolin had a protective effect when used to treat endometritis
through its inhibition of the activation or phosphorylation of p53
[42]. Moreover, luteolin attenuated p53 induced apoptosis in hep-
atic tissue [43], obesity [44], and heart failure ailments [45]. How-
ever, conﬂicting results have been observed in human colon
cancer, where luteolin promoted and activated p53 expression
[46,47]. This may be attributed to disease or tissue speciﬁcity, drug
administration, and biological complexity. Our results showed that
luteolin suppressed p-p53 activation by reducing p53 expression
and accumulation, leading to a decrease in MIRI, aligning with
the results of other studies investigating non-tumor diseases.

p53 induces cell apoptosis by regulating Bax, Bcl2, phorbol-12-
myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1, and myeloid cell leukemia
1 expression [48,49]. The excessive activation of the p53 pathway
initiates a cascade of ROS related gene activations [50,51]. p-p53
can also suppress the transcription of antioxidant genes [52]. Fur-
thermore, oxidative stress can facilitate cellular apoptosis [53].
Upon ROS stimulation, p53 protein was translocalized to the mito-
chondrial membrane and facilitated the accelerated opening of
membrane pores, leading to a decrease in membrane potential,
and exacerbation of the malignant loop of mitochondrial damage,
oxidative stress, and cellular apoptosis [54]. In our study, luteolin
treatment reduced apoptosis and ROS level in myocardium with
MIRI, accompanied by the decrease of p53. When the p53 agonist
was added, luteolin’s ability to reduce apoptosis and oxidative
stress was diminished; further, the p53 inhibitor exerted a similar

mitigation of apoptosis and oxidative stress as luteolin, suggesting
that the p53 pathway serves as a crucial route through which lute-
olin mitigates apoptosis and oxidative stress in myocardial cells.

Nevertheless, the precise regulatory effects of luteolin on p53
subunits remain to be further elucidated. For instance, integrating
molecular dynamics simulations with mutation analyses to
sequentially alter luteolin’s binding sites on the p53 protein sub-
structure could provide deeper insights into the mechanistic role
of luteolin with respect to p53. Moreover, the manner by which
luteolin improves mitochondrial oxidative stress via the p53 sig-
naling pathway still requires clariﬁcation, including whether it acts
through mitochondrial membrane fusion and ﬁssion or through
cellular energy metabolism. To this end, elucidating luteolin’s
mechanisms through mitochondrial function assessments, gene
expression analyses, and proteomics studies would lay a scientiﬁc
foundation for its application in treating cardiovascular disorders.
This study suggests that luteolin can reduce apoptosis and
oxidative stress by suppressing p53 expression, thus alleviating
myocardial damage in MIRI (Fig. 7). However, the speciﬁc regula-
tion of the p53 protein subunit by luteolin remains to be further
conﬁrmed. Whether luteolin affects other downstream signaling
pathways after modulating the p53 signaling pathway also needs
to be further investigated.

5. Conclusion

This study investigated the therapeutic efﬁcacy and fundamental
mechanism of luteolin on MIRI. Luteolin shielded mice from MIRI, as
indicated by the decreased myocardial infarct size and myocardial
enzyme levels and augmented systolic function. The results of
in vivo and in vitro experiments show that luteolin diminished
p53 expression and impeded nuclear translocation of p-p53, thereby
averting ROS generation and reducing cellular apoptosis. It is sug-
gested that luteolin mitigated cellular apoptosis and oxidative stress
by inhibiting phosphorylation of p53 to alleviate MIRI. This study
validates luteolin’s potential as a natural drug for MIRI therapy.
