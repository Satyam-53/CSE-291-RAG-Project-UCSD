Inactivating TP53 mutations leads to a loss of function of p53, but can also
often result in oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) of mutant p53 (mutp53)
proteins which promotes tumor development and progression. The GOF
activities of TP53 mutations are well documented, but the mechanisms
involved remain poorly understood. Here, we study the mutp53 interactome
and ﬁnd that by targeting minichromosome maintenance complex compo-
nents (MCMs), GOF mutp53 predisposes cells to replication stress and chro-
mosomal instability (CIN), leading to a tumor cell-autonomous and cyclic
GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent
cytosolic DNA response that activates downstream non-canonical nuclear
factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NC-NF-κB) signaling.
Consequently, GOF mutp53-MCMs-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-NC-NF-κB
signaling promotes tumor cell metastasis and an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment through antagonizing interferon signaling and regulating
genes associated with pro-tumorigenic inﬂammation. Our ﬁndings have
important implications for understanding not only the GOF activities of TP53
mutations but also the genome-guardian role of p53 and its inactivation during
tumor development and progression.

The tumor suppressor p53 is among the most important factors that
preserve genomic stability and integrity1. Early studies of p53 function
and the consequences of TP53 mutation demonstrated that p53 reg-
ulates DNA-damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints and inactivation of
which enables genomic instability2–4, indicating that p53 acts as the
“guardian of the genome” which prevents cells from developing
potentially tumor-promoting mutations and abnormal genomes5. A
recent study in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
further showed that the inactivation of p53 does not merely open a
gateway to genetic chaos but, rather, can enable a predictable pattern

of cancer genomic development (i.e., accumulation of deletions,
genome doubling, and the emergence of gains and ampliﬁcations),
suggesting that p53 and its inactivation play a deterministic role in the
ordered development of CIN in cancer6. Although in vivo evidence has
indicated that p53 suppresses tumorigenesis by inducing a set of
transcriptional programs that prevent the proliferation of cells and
that ongoing p53 inactivation is needed to sustain malignant
disease4,7–11, this latest study suggested that p53 inactivation is not
sufﬁcient in and of itself for malignant transformation; the acquisition
of recurrent chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) is also

required6. Because CNAs/aneuploidy achieved by CIN cause a wide
range of tumorigenic consequences12,
it is important to further
understand whether the oncogenic phenotypes associated with CIN—
altered proliferation13, cell survival14, drug resistance15, metastasis16,
immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy17, and shorter
patient survival in many cancers18,19 are attributable to altered gene
expression programs due to the gain and/or loss of genes, or whether
CIN itself has also a direct impact on the development of these onco-
genic phenotypes. Similarly, a better understanding of how p53 inac-
tivation enables the development of CIN is also critical. That is, it
remains unclear whether p53 inactivation-induced CIN is due only to
the loss of the transcription programs of wild-type p53 (wtp53) or
whether other mechanisms are also involved.

Inactivating mutations in TP53 are the most common cancer dri-
ver mutations and present a route to malignant transformation in
more than half of all human cancers20–22. Although inactivating muta-
tions of TP53 lead to loss of function (LOF) of wtp53 and/or dominant-
negative mutp53s, studies using mouse models clearly indicate that
some mutp53s can confer oncogenic GOF activities to promote
tumorigenesis and metastasis23,24. So far, mutp53 GOF activities, such
as the promotion of cell proliferation, survival, invasion, cancer-
promoting metabolism, drug resistance, and pro-tumorigenic inﬂam-
mation, have been observed in in vitro and in vivo experimental
models, and many GOF mechanisms, such as mutp53 interaction with
transcription factors and/or cellular proteins that impact transcription
programs and cellular functions, have been proposed25–33. However,
these proposed mechanisms are often context-dependent, and many
mutp53-mediated GOF phenotypes vary across experimental settings
(e.g., in different cells or clones). Interestingly, in striking contrast to all
of the previously proposed mechanisms, a recent study demonstrated
that expression of GOF mutp53 has no close causal relationship with
GOF phenotypes including gene expression changes, enhanced pro-
liferation, tumorigenicity, tumor growth, metabolic alterations, and
drug resistance. Moreover, that study demonstrated that GOF phe-
notypes are only associated with aneuploidy in cells with mutp5334.
This ﬁnding strongly suggests that the consequences of CIN in mutp53
cells may contribute to many previously reported mutp53 GOF phe-
notypes. Given the strong propensity for cells with mutp53 to become
aneuploid and the overlap of oncogenic phenotypes related to mutp53
GOF and aneuploidy, it has been suggested that GOF phenotypes
identiﬁed in mutp53 models must be carefully validated relative to
corresponding chromosomal changes34. Therefore, while this study
highlighted the importance of CIN in mutp53 GOF-associated pheno-
types and suggested that acquisition of aneuploidy may be a unifying
mechanism that accounts for many context-speciﬁc GOF phenotypes
previously attributed to mutp53 proteins, the underlying mechanisms
that link GOF mutp53 and CIN still remain unclear.

Although LOF mutations of p53 impair cell cycle checkpoints and
DNA repair, which can lead to the development of CIN2–4, accumulating
evidence has also shown that many mutp53s not only lose the genome-
guardian role of wtp53 but also gain oncogenic functions to promote
CIN through targeting various proteins
involved in genome
stabilization26. Six MCMs form a MCM2-7 hexameric complex. As the
key DNA replication regulator, the MCM2-7 complex forms the DNA
replication licensing system, which assembles the replication
machinery at replication origins with the origin recognition complex
during replication initiation. This complex forms the catalytic core of
the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS helicase that unwinds DNA during
elongation35. Therefore, disruption and/or dysregulation of the MCM2-
7 complex predisposes cells to replication stress, CIN, and the devel-
opment of cancers36–39. Here, we examined the mutp53 interactome
and identiﬁed MCMs as the protein targets through which mutp53
exerts its GOF activities to predispose cancer cells with mutp53 to
replication stress and CIN. In turn, these events lead to a tumor cell-
intrinsic cytosolic DNA response involving cGAS-STING-dependent

activation of downstream NC-NF-κB signaling, which promotes tumor
metastasis and tumor immunosuppression.

Results
GOF mutp53 interacts with MCMs
To identify the mutp53 interactome, we expressed G245D mutp53 in
p53-deﬁcient head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) UM-
SCC-1 cells and used them for quantitative proteomic analyses using
both stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
and immunoprecipitation (IP) with 2 different p53 antibodies (DO-1
and Pab240) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). After puriﬁcation, the protein
complexes were quantitatively analyzed by liquid chromatography
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In 8 independent experi-
ments, we identiﬁed 33 proteins that interacted with G245D mutp53 in
UM-SCC-1 cells (Supplementary Data 1). Many of them, such as the
p6340, FAM83A41, FUBP142, TGM243, SNRPN44, MCM545, and MCM746,
were previously shown to interact with wtp53 and/or mutp53s, which
validated the reliability of our approach. Metascape enrichment
analysis47 of puriﬁed G245D mutp53-interacting proteins showed that
the gene ontology (GO) term “regulation of DNA replication initiation”
involving MCM5, MCM7, and WRNIP1 was signiﬁcantly enriched (Fig. 1a
and Source Data to Fig. 1a), which strongly suggests that mutp53s play
an important role in regulation of DNA replication initiation.

To investigate the mechanisms involved, the speciﬁc interaction
of MCM5 and MCM7 with mutp53s was further validated by reciprocal
IP assays using cell lines with various endogenous p53 mutations in the
presence or absence of interferon γ (IFN-γ), which was previously
shown to promote the interaction of MCM5 and Stat148 (Fig. 1b, c and
Supplementary Fig. 1b–e). Furthermore, our IP assay of cells co-
transfected with exogenous wtp53 or mutp53s and MCM5 demon-
strated that (1) mutp53s (i.e., R273H, G245D, R175H) bound to MCM5
(Fig. 1d, lanes 4–6 and Fig. 1e); (2) wtp53 and mutp53 R248Q did not
bind (or weakly bound) to MCM5 (Fig. 1d, lanes 3, 7 and Fig. 1e), sup-
porting the idea that wtp53 and these various mutp53 proteins have
different properties28; (3) both N-terminal transactivation domain- and
DNA-binding domain-deleted R273H mutp53s (i.e., R273H-ΔTA and
R273H-ΔDBD) bound to MCM5 (Fig. 1d, lanes 8 and 11), whereas
C-terminal domain deletion of R273H mutp53 resulted in loss of
MCM5-binding activity (Fig. 1d,
lane 10), suggesting that R273H
mutp53 binds to MCM5 through its C-terminal domain; (4) although
R273H/L and several other mutp53s also interacted with other com-
ponents of the MCM2-7 complex (e.g., MCM2, MCM3, and MCM7),
they bound most strongly to MCM5 (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary
Fig. 1c–e). Finally, although R248Q mutp53 did not bind to MCM5
(Fig. 1d, lane 7 and Supplementary Fig. 1f, lane 6), our IP results using
UM-SCC-1 cell line expressing R248Q mutp53 showed that it strongly
bound to MCM7 (Supplementary Fig. 1g, lane 4), suggesting that dif-
ferent mutp53s interact with the components of the MCM2-7 complex
differently. Collectively, our results demonstrate that mutp53s interact
with MCMs.

GOF mutp53 predisposes cells to replication stress and CIN
through MCM5
MCM5 and MCM7 are two of the 6 components of the MCM2-7 het-
erohexameric complex. Given that MCM2-7 forms the DNA replication
helicase system that is important for high-ﬁdelity DNA replication and
genomic stability35–39,49–51, we examined the functional role of the
mutp53-MCM5 interaction in the development of replication stress
and CIN. To this end, we introduced the expression of exogenous
immortalized, non-
wtp53 or GOF mutp53s in TP53-knockout,
transformed human normal epithelial hTERT HAK cl41 cells and p53-
deﬁcient UM-SCC-1 cancer cells. In response to a low concentration
(100 μM) of hydroxyurea (an inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase that depletes the pool of available deoxyribonucleotides
and induces replication stress), cells expressing G245D, R273H, or

R248Q mutp53, but not those expressing wtp53 or the C-terminus
truncated Δ336 mutp53 that does not bind to MCM5 (Fig. 1d, lanes 3 &
10), exhibited greater chromatin accumulation of both mutp53s and
phosphorylated and/or total replication protein A 32 kd subunit
(RPA32), a marker of replication stress, than did the control cells
(Fig. 2a, lanes 12 vs. 8 and 10; Fig. 2b, lanes 18 vs. 14, 22 vs. 14; Sup-
plementary Fig. 1h, lanes 4 and 6 vs. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1i, lanes
6 vs. 4). Consistent with this, more nuclear RPA32 foci were seen in
mutp53-expressing hTERT HAK cl41-p53KO-c1 cells treated with
hydroxyurea than in control cells without mutp53 expression (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1j). Given the strong interaction between MCM5 and
G245D or R273H/L mutp53 (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 1f), we
focused the following studies on investigation of the functional role of
the interaction between MCM5 and G245D or R273H/L mutp53 in
regulation of DNA replication, and then we further explored its con-
sequential biological implications.

In line with the strong interaction of MCM5 and R273H mutp53,
R273H mutp53-induced chromatin accumulation of RPA32 in response
to hydroxyurea treatment was efﬁciently suppressed by over-
expression of MCM5 (Fig. 2b, lanes 20 vs. 18, 24 vs. 22; Supplementary
Fig. 1k, lanes 16 vs. 14 and Supplementary Fig. 1l, lanes 16 vs. 14) but not
by expression of MCM2 (Supplementary Fig. 1l, compare lanes 16 vs. 14
to 8 vs. 6) that has weak R273H/L mutp53 binding (Fig. 1f, g). To further
test the speciﬁcity of MCM5’s impact, we generated an inactive MCM5
mutant (R732A & K734A) that was unable to interact with other com-
ponents of the MCM2-7 complex48, such as MCM3 (Supplementary
Fig. 1m, lanes 5 vs. 6) but still maintained R273H mutp53-binding

activity (Supplementary Fig. 1n, lanes 8 vs. 7). This mutant MCM5
exhibited greater inhibition of R273H mutp53-induced chromatin
accumulation of RPA32 than did the wild-type MCM5 in the presence
of hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig. 1o, compare lanes 10 vs. 6 to 8 vs.
6). This was because, in addition to inhibition of mutp53, over-
expression of the wild-type MCM5 subunit alone likely disrupted the
stoichiometry of the MCM2-7 complex (i.e., dominant-negative effect),
thereby impairing MCM2-7 complex function and predisposing cells to
replication stress (Supplementary Fig. 1k, l, lanes 11 and 12 vs. 9 and 10
and Supplementary Fig. 1o, lanes 4 vs. 2), whereas expression of R732A
and K734A mutant MCM5 did not impact the MCM2-7 complex, but
only bound to and inhibited mutp53.

In further support of the role of mutp53-MCM5 signaling in pre-
disposing cells to replication stress, the knockdown of endogenous
mutp53 in MDA1586 (R273L mutp53) and PCI-15B (R273C mutp53) cells
led to much less chromatin accumulation (Fig. 2c, lanes 4 vs. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 2a, lanes 4 vs. 2), fewer nuclear foci of RPA32
(Supplementary Fig. 2b), and fewer stalled and more newly initiated
DNA forks in the DNA ﬁber assay (Supplementary Fig. 2c–e) than were
seen in parental control cells treated with hydroxyurea. However,
further knockdown of MCM5 (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g) rescued RPA32
chromatin accumulation (Fig. 2c, lanes 6 vs. 4, 8 vs. 4 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 2h, lanes 6 vs. 4, 8 vs. 4), formation of RPA32 nuclear foci
(Supplementary Fig. 2i), and stalled DNA forks (Supplementary
Fig. 2c–e) under the same condition.

In line with these results, more chromosomal abnormalities were
seen in immortalized, non-transformed human normal epithelial hTERT

Fig. 2 | GOF mutp53 predisposes cells to replication stress and CIN
through MCM5. a–c Western blot analyses using the cytosol and chromatin-bound
fractions from the indicated stable cell lines. Overexpression in stable cell lines was
established by sequential retroviral (pBabe-wt/mutp53s) and lentiviral (pLVX-
MCM5) infections (a, b). Gene downregulation in cell lines was established by
sequential lenti-shp53 and two independent doxycycline (DOX)-inducible-shMCM5
lentiviral infections (shMCM5-C or -G) (c). In c, cells were cultured in a medium with
DOX (200 ng/mL) for 48 to 96 h before further hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. NT,

HAK cl41-p53KO-c1 cells expressing R273H or G245D mutp53 than in
control cells, especially in the presence of hydroxyurea (Fig. 2d, e and
Supplementary Fig. 2j, k). In contrast, the downregulation of endo-
genous R273L mutp53 in MDA1586 cells reduced the chromosomal
abnormalities in response to hydroxyurea treatment (Supplementary
Fig. 2l, m). Most importantly, these mutp53-induced chromosomal
abnormalities were further inhibited by further MCM5 overexpression
(Fig. 2e). Taken together, our results not only show that GOF mutp53
predisposes cells to replication stress and CIN but also strongly suggest
that this predisposition is due to mutp53 and MCM5 interaction that
leads to functional disruption of MCM2-7 complex.

GOF mutp53-MCM5-mediated replication stress and CIN stimu-
late cytosolic DNA and 2′3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP)
accumulation
Replication stress and CIN induced by chromosomal mis-
segregation can activate innate immune signaling through the

introduction of genomic DNA into the cytosol and activation of the
cGAS-STING pathway16,52. In agreement with this, we found that
overexpression of G245D or R273H mutp53 in p53-null UM-SCC-1
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a) resulted in more accumulation of
both cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) than in control cells in either the absence
or presence of hydroxyurea (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary
Fig. 3b–h). Consistent with its “dominant-negative effect” on the
MCM2-7 complex, MCM5 overexpression alone in the absence of
mutp53 increased the accumulation of cytosolic dsDNA (Fig. 3a, b)
in response to hydroxyurea treatment in UM-SCC-1 cells, but
overexpression of MCM5 in the presence of mutp53 inhibited
mutp53-induced cytosolic dsDNA and ssDNA accumulation under
the same conditions (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3c–e, g, h).
Furthermore, knocking down mutp53 in MDA1586 or PCI-15B cells
signiﬁcantly decreased both cytosolic dsDNA and ssDNA accu-
mulation, but this decreased DNA accumulation was rescued by

further knocking down MCM5 expression in these cells (Fig. 3c, d
and Supplementary Fig. 3i–n). Consistently, overexpression of
R273H mutp53 in p53-null UM-SCC-1 cells resulted in more intra-
cellular cGAMP accumulation than in the control cells in either the
absence or presence of hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig. 3o).
Moreover, MCM5 overexpression alone in the absence of mutp53
increased the accumulation of cGAMP in response to hydroxyurea

treatment, but overexpression of MCM5 and, especially, over-
expression of R732A/K734A mutant MCM5 in the presence of
R273H mutp53 inhibited mutp53-induced intracellular cGAMP
accumulation under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3o).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that GOF mutp53 pro-
motes cytoplasmic DNA and cGAMP accumulation, which is sup-
pressed by MCM5 overexpression.

GOF mutp53-MCM5-CIN-induced cytosolic DNA activates
NC-NF-κB signaling
Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway through
cGAMP, which in turn activates downstream TANK-binding kinase 1
(TBK1), promoting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
transcription factors such as IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-
κB53,54. To our surprise, mutp53 expression in UM-SCC-1 cells
appeared to stimulate only NC-NF-κB signaling (i.e., a higher level of
nuclear p52/RelB accumulation) when compared with control cells
treated with or without hydroxyurea (Fig. 3e, lanes 5 vs. 1, 6 vs. 2;
Fig. 3g, h; Supplementary Fig. 3p, lanes 7 vs. 5, 8 vs. 6 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3q, lanes 5 vs. 1, 6 vs. 2), whereas nuclear pIRF3 and
canonical NF-κB signaling (i.e., nuclear p-p65) were largely unaf-
fected (Supplementary Fig. 3p). Consistent with this, knockdown of
endogenous mutp53 in MDA1586 or PCI-15B cells signiﬁcantly
decreased nuclear p52/RelB accumulation (Fig. 3f, lanes 3 vs. 1, 4 vs. 2;
Fig. 3i, j; Supplementary Fig. 3r, lanes 7 vs. 5, 8 vs. 6 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3s, lanes 3 vs. 1, 4 vs. 2), suggesting that GOF mutp53
promotes NC-NF-κB signaling in these cells. In addition, knockdown
of mutp53 in MDA1586 and PCI-15B cells also reduced the nuclear
accumulation of p-p65 and/or pIRF3, especially in the presence of
hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig. 3r, lanes 8 vs. 6 and Supplementary
Fig. 3s, lanes 3 vs. 1, 4 vs. 2), indicating mutp53 activated canonical
NF-κB signaling in these cells. Nevertheless, our results showed that
in the absence of hydroxyurea, NC-NF-κB signaling was activated by
mutp53 in all 3 tested cell lines (UM-SCC-1, MDA1586, and PCI-15B)
(Fig. 3e–j and Supplementary Fig. 3p–s), supporting previous
observations that cGAS-STING signaling results in TBK1-dependent
activation of p65/p50 canonical NF-κB signaling and also activates
RelB/p52 NC-NF-κB signaling in a TBK1-independent manner54. Fur-
thermore, overexpression of MCM5 and especially overexpression of
R732A/K734A mutant MCM5 in UM-SCC-1 cells inhibited mutp53-
induced nuclear RelB/p52 accumulation in response to hydroxyurea
treatment (Fig. 3e, lanes 7 vs. 5, 8 vs. 6; Fig. 3g, h and Supplementary
Fig. 3q, compare lanes 10 vs. 6 to 8 vs. 6), whereas further knockdown
of MCM5 in mutp53-downregulated MDA1586 and PCI-15B cells
restored the nuclear p52/RelB accumulation that had been impaired
by mutp53 loss (Fig. 3f, lanes 6 vs. 4, 8 vs. 4; Fig. 3i, j and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3s, lanes 5 vs. 3, 6 vs. 4, 7 vs. 3, 8 vs. 4). Taken together,
our results strongly suggest that GOF mutp53-MCM5 signaling not
only predisposes cells to replication stress and CIN that lead to
cytosolic DNA and cGAMP accumulation, but also drives activation of
NC-NF-κB signaling.

GOF mutp53 promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis
through MCM5-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-induced
NC-NF-κB signaling
We and others have previously shown that the promotion of tumor cell
invasion and metastasis is one of the most important features of
mutp53 GOF23,24,55. In support of the involvement of cGAS-STING-
signaling in NC-NF-κB activation, knockdown of either CGAS or STING1
inhibited mutp53-mediated NC-NF-κB signaling (Fig. 4a–c). Moreover,
knockdown of CGAS, STING1, or RelB in mutp53-overexpressing human
UM-SCC-1 or mouse p53-null 4T1 stable cells (Fig. 4d–f) impaired not
only mutp53-mediated in vitro transwell migration and invasion
(Fig. 4g–p) but also mutp53-induced in vivo lung metastases after cells
were injected into the tail veins of nude mice (Fig. 4q–s and Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a–c) or the mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Fig. 4t–w
and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Moreover, overexpression of MCM5 or
R732A/K734A mutant MCM5 in UM-SCC-1 stable cells in the presence
of mutp53 inhibited mutp53-induced in vitro transwell invasion (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4e–h) and in vivo lung metastasis from cells injected
into the tail veins of nude mice (Supplementary Fig. 4i, j). Consistently,
while knockdown of R273L mutp53 in MDA1586 cells inhibited in vitro
invasion and in vivo lung metastasis from tail-vein injection, further

knockdown of MCM5 in these cells rescued the impaired invasion and
lung metastasis caused by mutp53 knockdown (Supplementary
Fig. 4k–o). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCM5-
cGAS-STING-NC-NF-κB signaling plays an important role in mutp53
GOF-mediated tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

GOF mutp53-MCM5-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-induced
NC-NF-κB signaling promotes tumor immunosuppression
Our results also showed that compared with the control, expression of
murine R270H mutp53 in mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells exhibited GOF
activity to promote tumor growth when cells were injected into the
mammary fat pads of syngeneic BALB/c mice, but this GOF activity was
abolished by further knockdown of RelB expression (Fig. 5a). In con-
trast, when the same group of 4T1 stable cells was orthotopically
injected into immunodeﬁcient SCID mice, all tumors grew faster than
in immunocompetent BALB/c mice (Fig. 5b vs. 5a), but no mutp53 GOF
activity was observed; neither expression of R270H mutp53 nor further
knockdown of RelB had an impact on tumor growth when compared
with the control in SCID mice (Fig. 5b). All these results indicate that
R270H mutp53 promotes RelB-dependent tumor immunosuppression
in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. In support of this, increased
nuclear RelB localization was observed in R270H mutp53-expressing
4T1 tumors from BALB/c mice (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 5a). In
addition, multiplex immunoﬂuorescence staining or multiplexed ion
beam imaging (MIBI) (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c) showed that R270H
mutp53-expressing 4T1 tumors had less inﬁltration of CD3+CD8+ and
CD3+ T cells, granzyme B+ cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphoid
tissue-resident CD11b+ classical dendritic cells (cDCs) in BALB/c mice
compared with the control (Fig. 5e–m), suggesting that expression of
R270H mutp53 engendered a immunosuppressive tumor micro-
environment (TME) in 4T1 tumors. Moreover, further knockdown of
RelB expression tended to restore the decreased immune cell inﬁl-
tration induced by mutp53 expression (Fig. 5f, g, i, k, and m). This RelB-
dependent
R270H
mutp53 strongly suggests that tumor cell-intrinsic mutp53-NC-NF-κB
role in mutp53-induced tumor
signaling plays an important
immunosuppression.

GOF mutp53-MCM5-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-induced
NC-NF-κB signaling antagonizes interferon (IFN) signaling
In support of our identiﬁcation of mutp53-MCM5-cGAS-STING signal-
ing, results of RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) and Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) showed that IFN signaling (hallmarks of IFNα/γ
response) and inﬂammation-related signaling (i.e., hallmarks of TNFα
signaling + inﬂammatory
signaling
response) pathways were among the signaling pathways that were
most signiﬁcantly altered by modulating expression of R273H mutp53,
STING, RelB, and MCM5 in UM-SCC-1 and MDA1586 cells (Fig. 6a and
Supplementary Fig. 5e). Speciﬁcally, expression of R273H mutp53
generally increased IFN pathway gene expression, but subsequent
STING1 knockdown reduced it (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Fig. 6a).
However, in the presence of hydroxyurea, many R273H mutp53-
induced IFN signaling genes were suppressed when compared with
controls without hydroxyurea treatment (Fig. 6a and Supplementary
Fig. 6b). More importantly, inhibition of NC-NF-κB signaling through
RelB knockdown in p53-null UM-SCC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d) or
R273H mutp53-expressing UM-SCC-1 cells resulted in increased
expression of many IFN pathway genes (Fig. 6a–c; Supplementary
Figs. 5e and 6a, c), suggesting that mutp53-induced NC-NF-κB signal-
ing plays an important role in suppression of IFN signaling gene
expression.

Our results also showed that MCM5 overexpression increases IFN
pathway gene expression in the absence of mutp53 in UM-SCC-1 cells
(Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6d–g). However, MCM5 over-
expression in the presence of mutp53 reduced the expression of many

mutp53-induced IFN genes (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6d, e, h–k).
Consistently, knockdown of R273L mutp53 in MDA1586 cells reduced
IFN signaling gene expression, but subsequent knockdown of MCM5 in
these cells upregulated expression of many IFN pathway genes that
had been lost due to mutp53 knockdown (Fig. 6a and Supplementary
Fig. 6l–q). These data provide further evidence that MCM5 is involved
in mutp53-mediated IFN signaling.

Supplementary Fig. 6r–z), suggesting that some genes in these path-
ways are positively regulated by NC-NF-κB signaling. Consistent with
this, hierarchical clustering of single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) for IFN and
inﬂammation-related signaling pathways in HPV-negative and TP53-
mutant oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database identiﬁed a group of patients with low scores
for the IFN pathway but high scores for the inﬂammation-related
pathways (designated as “IFN-low/Inf-high” in Fig. 6d). This could
indicate repression of IFN genes but activation of inﬂammation-related
genes by NC-NF-κB signaling, as suggested by our cell line data.
Importantly, the IFN-low/Inf-high patients had the worst overall, dis-
ease-speciﬁc, and progression-free survival among all the other groups
(IFN-high/Inf-high [All High], IFN-low/Inf-low [All Low] and IFN-high/
Inf-low) (Fig. 6e, f and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Consistent with this,
compared with all other groups, IFN-low/Inf-high tumors exhibited a
trend toward the strongest epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
phenotype (Fig. 6g), which is often associated with HNSCC metastasis
and adverse pathological features56. Moreover, although both IFN-low/
Inf-high and All High tumors displayed more leukocytes and Th1 cell
and lymphocyte inﬁltration fractions, indicating more immune activity
than in other groups (Supplementary Fig. 7b–d), IFN-low/Inf-high
tumors had the lowest inﬁltration of activated natural killer (NK) cells
and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells among all groups (Fig. 6h, i), and had
lower CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ response, and M1 macrophages—but more
M0 macrophages—than did the IFN-high/Inf-low and All High groups
(Fig. 6j and Supplementary Fig. 7e–g). In addition, our analyses indi-
cated the presence of similar molecular patterns in TP53 mutant larynx
and lung squamous carcinomas, in which a trend toward high EMT
signature and low inﬁltration of activated NK, Tfh, and CD8+ T cells was
also observed in tumors with the “IFN-low/Inf-high” molecular phe-
notype (Supplementary Fig. 8a–j). Together, these results showed that
IFN-low/Inf-high tumors are associated with an immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment, strongly suggesting that mutp53-MCMs-
CIN-cytosolic DNA-STING-induced NC-NF-κB signaling, through inhi-
bition of IFN and activation of inﬂammation-related signaling in tumor
cells, has an important role in tumor progression and the resistance to
anti-tumor immunity of tumors with TP53 mutations (Fig. 6k).

Discussion
p53 was characterized as the “guardian of the genome” over 30 years
ago5. Its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and inhibiting
tumor development was recently re-demonstrated by Lowe and col-
leagues in a study showing that p53 can enable the predictable
development of CIN that is required for p53 loss-induced tumor
malignancy6. However, whether the development of CIN is attributable
to only p53 LOF or whether mutp53 GOF can also contribute to CIN
development is still not clear. Since the concept of mutp53 GOF was
introduced in the 1990s57,58, many context-dependent and conﬂicting
ﬁndings regarding the oncogenic GOF phenotypes associated with
overexpression of mutp53 proteins and related mechanisms have been

reported25–33. Of note, an important recent study from Pietenpol and
colleagues used both in vitro studies and an immunocompromised
nude mouse model to convincingly demonstrate that acquisition of
CIN is also required for mutp53-associated GOF phenotypes34. This
intriguing ﬁnding suggests that the acquisition of aneuploidy may be a
unifying mechanism that accounts for many context-speciﬁc GOF
phenotypes previously attributed to mutp53 proteins34. Since all
inactivating p53 mutations will result in CIN, the different roles of LOF,
dominant-negative, and GOF p53 mutations in enabling CIN develop-
ment are still not clear, although an increased frequency of aneuploidy
has been observed in p53 GOF mutant isogenic cell lines34. The work
presented here conﬁrms these other investigators’ ﬁndings, highlights
the importance of CIN in p53 mutation-induced oncogenic pheno-
types, and further demonstrates that there is indeed a causal rela-
tionship between mutp53 GOF and CIN, in which mutp53 actively
predisposes cells to replication stress and CIN through interaction with
MCMs and consequent deregulation of the MCM2-7 complex. Taken in
aggregate with these recent reports from other laboratories showing
that CIN is the prerequisite for p53 inactivation-induced malignancy
and for mutp53 GOF-associated phenotypes6,34, our ﬁndings reveal the
underlying mechanistic relationships between mutp53 GOF activity
and enhanced propensity to CIN.

to anti-tumor

It has been shown previously that CIN can activate chronic cGAS-
STING signaling, which can promote tumor metastasis and survival
through TBK1-independent activation of NC-NF-κB and IL-6-STAT3
signaling14,16,52,59.
In contrast, acute activation of the cGAS-STING
pathway often leads
immunity through TBK1-
dependent activation of IRF3 and canonical NF-κB p65/p50 signaling,
which mediate the transcription of type I IFN signaling53,60–62. Given
these dual but opposing roles (i.e., anti-tumorigenic vs. pro-
tumorigenic roles) of the cGAS-STING pathway, understanding how
this pathway is regulated in tumor cells to lead to different outcomes is
very important for studies of tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
Consistent with this, the cGAS-STING pathway is rarely inactivated in
primary tumors, but many tumors develop a variety of still poorly
understood mechanisms that suppress downstream type I IFN signal-
ing under chronic cGAS-STING signaling triggered by CIN52,59. Here, in
addition to supporting that CIN induces NC-NF-κB signaling16,52, our
results showed that mutp53-MCM5-CIN-cGAS-STING-induced NC-NF-
κB signaling not only promotes metastasis but also has an inhibitory
role in IFN signaling. Our ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies
showing that activation of NC-NF-κB antagonizes canonical NF-κB
signaling and STING-mediated type I IFN signaling63,64. Therefore, these
results strongly support an important role for mutp53-CIN in inducing
tumor cell-intrinsic resistance to anticancer immunity through NC-NF-
κB-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling or IFN tachyphylaxis—a pro-
cess of reduction in IFN responsiveness to repetitive stimulation—
which was recently shown by Bakhoum and colleagues to play an
important role in CIN-induced immune suppression and metastasis65.
Moreover, NC-NF-κB signaling also positively regulates some genes

in addition to its anti-tumor immunity,

involved in inﬂammation-related signaling, including IL-6-STAT3 sig-
naling (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6r–z), suggesting that it may
play an important role in pro-tumorigenic inﬂammation. Given that the
is also
immune system,
involved in tumor-promoting inﬂammation66 and selection of tumor
suppressor inactivation67 during tumor development and progression,
our identiﬁcation of GOF mutp53-induced, CIN-cGAS-STING–driven
NC-NF-κB activation has provided us a novel mechanistic insight into
how tumor cells with inactivating p53 mutations interact with immune
system to evade anti-tumor immunity.

It has previously been shown that GOF mutp53 can activate
canonical NF-κB signaling through direct interaction with p65
(RelA)68–71 and DAB2IP72 or NC-NF-κB signaling through stimulation
of NFKB2 (p52/p100 subunit) expression73,74. Here, our ﬁndings

provide additional evidence of the complexity of mutp53-mediated
NF-κB activation. Since canonical NF-κB signaling is rapid and
transient, whereas NC-NF-κB signaling is usually slow but
persistent75, our identiﬁcation of mutp53-induced and MCM5-CIN-
cGAS-STING-mediated activation of NC-NF-κB may have important
implications for understanding the previously described GOF role
in prolonged NF-κB activation and chronic
of mutp53
since canonical NF-κB activation
inﬂammation68. Moreover,
requires stimulation by extracellular ligands, whereas NC-NF-κB
signaling can be activated by CIN16,52, our ﬁnding of GOF mutp53-
MCM5-CIN-cGAS-STING-NC-NF-κB signaling not only demonstrates
a novel GOF mechanism of mutp53 but also strongly suggests that
NC-NF-κB activation is a common mechanism involved in all inac-
tivating p53 mutations that lead to CIN.

Although our current study focused on the MCM5-G245D or
-R273H mutp53 interaction because MCM5 has a much higher R273H/L
mutp53-binding afﬁnity than do other MCM subunits, R273H mutp53
also interacts with other subunits of the MCM2-7 complex (Fig. 1f, g)76.
Interestingly, whereas R248Q mutp53 did not bind to MCM5 well
(Fig. 1d, lane 7 and Supplementary Fig. 1f, lane 6), it strongly bound to
MCM7 (Supplementary Fig. 1g, lane 4). More importantly, R248Q

mutp53 showed a greater potential to induce replication stress than
did R273H mutp53 in UM-SCC-1 cells even though its expression level
was lower than that of R273H mutp53 (Supplementary Fig. 1h, lanes 5
and 6 vs. 3 and 4). Since the interaction with MCM7 and/or other MCM
subunits, like the interaction with MCM5, is also likely to disrupt the
stoichiometry of the MCM2-7 complex, especially when MCM2-7
complex assembly is much needed (e.g., under replication stress), it

In summary, our work reveals a tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism of
mutp53 GOF involving mutp53-MCMs-induced CIN, leading to the
activation of cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-NC-NF-κB signaling, which
plays an important role in promoting metastasis and immunosup-
pression (Fig. 6k). Supported by recent studies showing that the
acquisition
GOF
phenotypes34, that STING activity is often increased in TP53–mutant
compared with wt TP53 tumors77, and that cGAS and STING are
required for CIN-driven tumor progression65, our ﬁndings provide
signiﬁcant insight into not only the GOF mechanisms of TP53 muta-
tions but also all inactivating mutations of p53 that lead to genomic
instability to promote immune suppression and metastasis during
tumor development and tumor progression. This suggests that a
strategy for targeting tumor cell-intrinsic NC-NF-κB signaling could be
an impactful approach to treating cancers with TP53 inactivation-
induced CIN.

Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
Immortalized human normal head and neck epithelial hTERT HAK
cl41 cells78 (wtp53) (provided by Dr. Aloysius J. Klingelhutz, University
of Iowa Research Foundation) were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere in oral keratinocyte medium (ScienCell, #2611) supple-
mented with oral keratinocyte growth supplement (ScienCell, #2652).

Dr. D. M. Easty, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research), Ca9-22 (R248W
mutp53) (Japan Health Science Research Resource Bank), 4T1 (p53-
null) (MD Anderson Cytogenetics and Cell Authentication Core),
HEK293-FT (Thermoﬁsher, R70007), and all stable cell lines subse-
quently established from these cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5%
CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine in the presence of
penicillin (50 U/mL) and streptomycin (50 μg/mL). All the cell lines
used in this study tested negative for mycoplasma and were authen-
ticated and veriﬁed by short tandem repeat proﬁling performed on
cellular DNA submitted to the MD Anderson Cytogenetics and Cell
Authentication Core Facility or the Fragment Analysis Facility of Johns
Hopkins University. The detailed short tandem repeats allelic patterns
of each cell line were reported previously80 and are listed in Supple-
mentary Data 2.

Overexpression and knockdown DNA constructs
Retroviral pBabe-puro-based human wt/mutp53 overexpression and
lentiviral pLVHMshp53 vectors were described previously81,82. wt/
mutp53s were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
cloned into an XbaI-digested Flag-HA-pcDNA3.1 vector using the In-
Fusion cloning strategy (Takara Bio) to get Flag and HA double-tagged
constructs. Similarly, MCMs were synthesized by reverse transcription
PCR and cloned into EcoRI-digested pcDNA3.1/V5-His-A or pLVX-IRES-
mCherry vectors using In-Fusion cloning. A TP53 CRISPR/Cas9 knock-
out plasmid was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. Murine R270H
mutp53 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pMXs-p53
as a template and then cloned into a pLVX-IRES-hygro vector using In-
Fusion cloning. The sequences of all the constructs were validated by
sequencing analyses. Lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against
MCM5, CGAS, STING1 (TMEM173), and human and murine RelB were
purchased from Dharmacon or Sigma-Aldrich. Information on all the
vectors, primers, and shRNAs is listed in Supplementary Data 3.

Generation of stable cell lines
hTERK HAK Cl41-p53KO cells were obtained from hTERT HAK
Cl41 cells by transient transfection (using Lipofectamine 2000) with
the TP53 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout plasmid and then sorting by ﬂow
cytometry for single-cell GFP-positive clones. Stable hTERK HAK Cl41-
p53KO-c1 and UM-SCC-1 cells overexpressing wtp53 or various
mutp53s were obtained from pools of cells after retroviral infection
and puromycin (1 μg/mL) selection. Retroviruses used for infections
were generated by transfecting various pBabe wtp53 or mutp53 vec-
tors with the packaging vectors pCMV-VSV-G and pCMV-gag-pol into
HEK293-FT cells. MCM5 or MCM5 R732A/K734A expression was
achieved by lentiviral infection using virus generated from HEK293-FT
cells transfected with a pLVX-MCM5/MCM5 R732A & K734A-IRES-
mCherry plasmid and the lentiviral packaging vectors pCMV-dR8.2
dvpr and pMD2.G; cells stably expressing MCM5 or MCM5 R732A/
K734A were selected and sorted for mCherry expression. Doxycycline-
inducible MCM5 or MCM2 expression was achieved by lentiviral
infection using a virus generated from HEK293-FT cells transfected
with TRE3G-MCM5/MCM2-PGK-Tet3G-bsd and the lentiviral packaging
vectors, followed by blasticidin (ThermoFisher, #A1113903) selection.
Murine R270H mutp53 expression was achieved by lentiviral infection
using a virus generated from HEK293-FT cells transfected with a pLVX-
R270H-IRES-hygro plasmid and its packaging vectors psPAX2 and
pMD2.G, followed by hygromycin (ThermoFisher, #10687010) selec-
tion. Stable knockdown of TP53 was achieved by lentiviral infection
using a virus generated from HEK293-FT cells transfected with
pLVHMshp53 and the lentiviral packaging vectors, followed by sorting
of GFP-positive cells. Stable knockdown of cGAS, STING1, and RELB was
achieved by lentiviral infection using a virus generated from HEK293-
FT cells transfected with pGIPZ-shRNAs and the lentiviral packaging
vectors, followed by sorting of GFP-positive cells. Stable knockdown of
MCM5 was achieved by lentiviral infection using a virus generated from

HEK293-FT cells transfected with doxycycline-inducible SMART-
shRNAs-mCMV-TurboRFP vector and the lentiviral packaging vec-
tors, followed by sorting of RFP-positive cells in the presence of dox-
ycycline (200 ng/mL) (Fisher Scientiﬁc #BP26531). Stable knockdown
of murine RELB was achieved using a virus generated from HEK293-FT
cells transfected with pLKO.1-puro-shRNAs and the lentiviral packa-
ging vectors, followed by puromycin selection. Information on all the
plasmids used is provided in Supplementary Data 3.

Mutp53 interactome screening by quantitative immunopreci-
pitation using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell
culture (SILAC)
To identify GOF mutp53 interactome, we selected p53-deﬁcient UM-
SCC-1 cell line and G245D mutp53 since our previous study showed
that overexpression of G245D mutp53 alone or in combination with
expression of a constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinase PIK3CA
H1047R in UM-SCC-1 cells exhibited a great mutp53 GOF function to
promote cell invasive growth and metastasis in an orthotopic nude
mouse model (manuscript in preparation). To this end, UM-SCC-1-
pBabe, UM-SCC-1-mutp53G245D, and UM-SCC-1-mutp53G245D &
PIK3CA H1047R cells were labeled via passaging for up to 8 cell divi-
sions in DMEM containing L-arginine (Arg 0) and L-lysine (Lys 0)
(“light”) or L-arginine-U-13C6
15N2 (Lys 8)
(“heavy”). For immunoprecipitation (IP)-mass spectrometry (MS),
1 × 107 cells were lysed with NETN buffer (0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA,
20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], and 100 mM NaCl with freshly added pro-
tease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride
[PMSF], 1 μg/mL pepstatin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin, 1 mM sodium vanadate,
15 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 50 mM NaF) on ice for 30 min. The
lysates were incubated with 20 μL of p53 antibody-agarose (see Sup-
plementary Data 4) for 2 h at 4 °C. After 4 washes with NETN buffer, the
paired samples were combined and then boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer
(4% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 20% glycerol, 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH
6.8) before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The
entire sample lane of SDS gel was excised into 3 fractions and then
destained, and digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. On the next
day, the digested peptides were extracted with acetonitrile and
vacuum-dried before MS analyses.

15N4 (Arg 10) and L-lysine-U-13C6

Mass spectrometry and data analysis
The digested peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, then loaded
into a nanoscale liquid chromatography system (EASY-nLC 1000 liquid
chromatography system, ThermoFisher), and separated with a 75-min
discontinuous gradient of 4–24% ACN/0.1% formic acid. The ﬂow rate
was set at 800 nL/min. After peptide separation, they were analyzed by
Q Exactive Plus (ThermoFisher). The settings for mass spectrometry
included data-dependent mode, precursor MS scan range at
375–1300 m/z; mass resolution for MS1 and MS2 of 140,000 and
17,500, respectively; AGC for MS1 and MS2 of 3 × 106 and 2 × 105,
respectively; the top 25 precursor ions were selected to analyze by MS2
with collision energy at 27.

Raw MS data were processed by MaxQuant software (version
1.5.8.3) with an FDR < 0.01 at the PSM and protein level. MS tolerance
for MS1 was 20 ppm, and for MS2 was 0.5 Da. Oxidation of methionine,
acetylation of N-term, and carbamidomethyl of cysteine were selected
as variable modiﬁcations. The minimum length for peptides was 7
amino acids. A target-decoy approach with a reversed database was
used for protein and peptide identiﬁcation. The human FASTA data-
base was downloaded from UniProt (April 2017) containing 70946
entries. Peptides and proteins were quantiﬁed by MaxQuant with
default settings. Two different cell line comparisons (i.e., G245D
mutp53 vs. pBabe; G245D mutp53 and PIK3CA H1047R vs. pBabe) were
analyzed. In each group, duplicates with both heavy (H)/light (L) and
reverse L/H SILAC labeling were used for IP with 2 different p53 anti-
bodies (DO-1 and Pab240, respectively; see Supplementary Data 4).

Therefore, in total, 8 experiments were carried out. MS data were
searched in the Maxquant database. The cutoff values for candidates
were a median fold change higher than 1.5 (G245D/pBabe or G245D +
PIK3CA/pBabe) and a P-value (two-sided t-test) lower than 0.05 in all 8
experiments. Finally, metascape enrichment analysis47 was used to
analyze the results.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in an extraction buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1%
Triton-X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl,
2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail
[Millipore Sigma #11697498001]). Lysates were clariﬁed by cen-
trifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. For IP, the supernatants were
incubated with the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C with
constant rotation. After the addition of Dynabeads protein G beads
(ThermoFisher #10003D), the lysates were incubated for an additional
5 to 10 min at room temperature. Next, the beads were separated
magnetically and washed up to 6 times with the extraction buffer
before the addition of SDS Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting. The antibodies used are listed in Supplemen-
tary Data 4.

Immunoblotting
In addition to nuclear and chromatin extracts, total cell extracts were
obtained from cells pelleted and lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. The con-
centration of total cell extracts was determined using a Bradford
protein assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. See Supplementary Data 4 for
antibody information. Blots were developed with SuperSignal West
Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, exposed to autoradiographic ﬁlms
(LabScientiﬁc by ThermoFischer), and scanned on an Epson Perfection
V800 Photo Scanner. Protein bands’ densitometry was measured and
calculated using NIH Image J software. Uncropped and unprocessed
scans of the blots are provided in the Source Data ﬁles.

Nuclear extracts and chromatin fraction isolation
A previously described method83 was used with modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, to isolate nuclear extracts, cells were resuspended in buffer
A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose,
10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 1× protease inhibitor
cocktail, 0.1 mM PMSF). Triton-X-100 (0.1%) was added, and the
cells were incubated for 5 to 10 min on ice. Nuclei were collected as
pellets (P1) by low-speed centrifugation (5 min, 1300 g, 4 °C). The
supernatant (the cytosolic fraction) was further clariﬁed by high-
speed centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 g, 4 °C) to remove cell debris
and insoluble aggregates. To obtain nuclear extracts, nuclear pel-
lets were washed twice with buffer A, and then directly resuspended
and dissolved in Laemmli buffer with sonication in a Branson digital
sonicator. Alternatively, to isolate the chromatin fraction, nuclear
pellets (P1) were washed once in buffer A and then lysed in buffer B
(3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor cock-
tail). The insoluble chromatin fraction was collected by cen-
trifugation (5 min, 1700g, 4 °C) and washed once in buffer B under
the same conditions. The ﬁnal
insoluble chromatin pellet was
resuspended and dissolved in Laemmli buffer with sonication. The
concentrations of nuclear or chromatin proteins were determined
by a Pierce 660-nm protein assay (#22660) with Ionic Detergent
Compatibility Reagent (#22663) before the nuclear or chromatin
fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

at 37 °C, and then treated with hydroxyurea (100 μM) for 24 to 72 h at
37 °C. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and treated with colcemid (0.2 mg/mL, Millipore Sigma
#10295892001) for 18 h. For MDA1586 cells, 6 × 104 cells were plated in
a 6-well plate with 3 mL DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C and then treated with
hydroxyurea (200 μM) for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed
once with PBS and treated with colcemid (0.15 mg/mL) for 6 h. After
colcemid treatment, cells were trypsinized, transferred to 15-mL con-
ical tubes, and centrifuged. The cell pellets were treated with hypo-
tonic solution (0.075 M KCl) for 20 min at room temperature and then
ﬁxed in a methanol and acetic acid mixture (3:1 v/v) for 15 min at room
temperature and washed 3 times with ﬁxative. The samples were then
sent to MD Anderson’s Cytogenetics and Cell Authentication Core
Facility for the generation of chromosome spreads on glass slides
according to the standard protocol. Slides were stained with 4%
Giemsa and analyzed for various chromosomal aberrations, including
chromosome and chromatid breaks, fusions, fragments, and tetra-
ploidy. At least 35 metaphases were analyzed from each sample. Ima-
ges were captured using a Nikon 80i microscope equipped with
karyotyping software from Applied Spectral Imaging, Inc.

DNA ﬁber assay
Cells were treated with 25 mM CldU for 20 min followed by 200 μM
hydroxyurea and 250 μM IdU for 4 h. Then, cells were lysed in spreading
buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS), streaked onto
glass slides, dried, and ﬁxed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid for 10 min. DNA
was denatured with 2 N HCl for 30 min, blocked in 10% horse serum, and
stained overnight with rat anti-BrdU antibody and 1:300 mouse anti-
BrdU antibody overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed in TBST containing
1 M salt followed by PBS, and then stained with secondary antibodies
(anti-rat Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies) for
1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Vectashield and
imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE100. See Supplementary Data 4 for
antibody information.

Immunoﬂuorescent microscopy
For detection of cytosolic ssDNA and dsDNA, cells growing on
coverslips were washed with PBS 2 times, ﬁxed with 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then permeabilized with 0.02%
(for UM-SCC-1 and MDA1586 cells) or 2 × 10−7% (for PCI-15B cells)
saponin for 1 to 5 min and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS for 30 min. For ssDNA S1 nuclease (ThermoFisher Sci-
entiﬁc, FEREN0321) and dsDNase (Life Technologies, #EN0771)
treatment, cells were permeabilized with saponin for 2 min and
treated with either nuclease for 10 min before ﬁxation using 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with
an anti-ssDNA or anti-dsDNA antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed,
and then stained with a secondary antibody conjugated to an Alexa
Fluor 647 or Alexa Fluor 477 anti-mouse IgG and DAPI (1 μg/mL) for
1 h at room temperature. Cells were then mounted on the slides with
an antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, #H-1000).
Images were acquired by using an Andor Revolution XDi WD spin-
ning disk confocal microscope. Imaris ×64 9.3.0 software was used
to deﬁne the boundaries of cells and nuclei using the colors of GFP
(MDA1586 and PCI-15B stable cell lines) or RFP (UM-SCC-1 stable cell
line) and DAPI, then the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of ssDNA/
dsDNA in the cytosol of each cell was quantiﬁed. For detection of
nuclear RPA32, p53, Rad51, and RelB, cells were ﬁxed and permea-
bilized with 0.5% Triton 100 in PBS for 15 min, then blocked with 5%
BSA-PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min. Cells were incubated
with each individual primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then
with a ﬂuorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature, mounted on the slides, imaged, and quantiﬁed as
described above. Information on the antibodies used is provided in
Supplementary Data 4.

Quantiﬁcation of cytosolic DNA
To isolate cytosolic DNA, 1 × 107 cells were lysed, and the nuclear,
cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were obtained using a mito-
isolation kit for cell culture (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc,
chondrial
#89874). In order to enable subsequent DNA puriﬁcation, protease
inhibitors were not used. Mitochondria were puriﬁed by centrifugation
at 12,000 × g to minimize their contamination of the cytosolic fraction.
DNA was isolated from the nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial
fractions using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, #69504), and
dsDNA was quantiﬁed using an AccuBlue high-sensitivity dsDNA
quantitation kit (Biotium, #31006).

cGAMP measurement
Cells treated with or without HU were lysed by RIPA buffer with a 1×
protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were used to measure cGAMP
concentration using a 2′,3′-cyclic GAMP competitive ELISA kit (Invi-
trogen, #EIAGAMP) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

In vitro invasion and migration assay
A 24-well BioCoat growth factor reduced Matrigel invasion chamber
(Corning, #354483) was used for invasion and migration assays.
Speciﬁcally, 5 × 104 UM-SCC-1 or 1 × 105 MDA1586 stable cells were
seeded in the upper chambers and incubated with serum-free
DMEM; DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was
added to the lower chamber. The plates were placed in an incubator
(37 °C) under 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells in the upper chamber were
removed using cotton swabs, and the cells that had invaded and
migrated to the lower chamber were stained with a solution of 0.2%
crystal violet in 25% methanol. Then the chamber membranes were
mounted on glass slides and examined with a Leica DMLA micro-
scope. At least three random 100× ﬁelds were selected for each cell
line. Cell numbers were counted and analyzed using Image J
software (NIH).

Animal study
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). For human cell line studies, stable
cells were injected into the tail veins of 5- to 6-week-old athymic male
nude mice (Harlan, athymic nu/nu) as previously described81. Mice
lines were fed a doxycycline-
injected with MDA1586 stable cell
containing rodent diet (Envigo, #TD.01306). For murine 4T1 cell stu-
dies, stable cells were injected into the 4th mammary fat pads of
8-week-old female BALB/cJ or NOD SCID (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid/J) mice
(Jackson Laboratories). Tumor growth was measured by digital cali-
pers, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula V = (L ×
W × W)/2. At the end of the experiments, mice were sacriﬁced, primary
tumor and/or lungs were collected and ﬁxed, embedded in parafﬁn,
sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). To calculate
the rate of microscopic metastasis (Fig. 4s, w and Supplementary
Fig. 4o), 3 consecutive H & E-stained sections per lung, 100 to 300 μm
apart, were selected, stained with H & E and scanned with an Aperio
AT2 microscope (Leica) into an e-slide manager system. E-slides were
viewed with Halo software (V2.3.2089.52; Indica Labs). The lung tissue
section area, tumor nodule number, and tumor nodule size were
measured by either manual or automatic methods. The manual
method was used for tissues with countable metastatic nodules.
Tumor nodules were identiﬁed and counted, and the area (mm2) of
each nodule and the whole lung tissue (excluding large air ducts, large
blood vessels, portal tissue, and lymph nodes, but including tumor
tissue) was measured. Total tumor areas were summed, and the per-
centage of the lung area containing tumor was calculated. The auto-
matic method was used for cases with tumor nodules that could not be
counted and measured manually. In this case, the software’s tissue
annotation was set, and tissue classiﬁers for tumors, normal lungs, air

ducts, and blood clots were developed. Then the lung normal tissue
area and tumor area were measured using these classiﬁers. Total tumor
areas and tumor area percentages in the lung sections were calculated.
To summarize the results, one of the 3 sections from each lung (total
8-10 lungs/group) was selected, and their lung metastatic rates were
summed and averaged as one set. Shown in Fig. 4s, w and Supple-
mentary Fig. 4o are the mean metastatic rates of 3 different sets
(shown as 3 points) of H & E sections, in which each point represents
the result from 8-10 individual sections from different lungs in
each group.

Immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunoﬂuorescence
staining
Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded mouse lungs were sec-
tioned. After deparafﬁnization and rehydration, antigens were
retrieved by boiling in Dako target retrieval solution (#S1699) for
15 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, and sections were then blocked by 5%
BSA in Tris-buffered saline + polysorbate 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room
temperature. For IHC staining, sections were incubated with primary
antibodies diluted in 2.5% BSA in TBST at 4 °C overnight, then with a
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room
temperature for 1 h. Finally, results were visualized by using a Dako
liquid DAB+ substrate chromogen system (K3468). For CD3+, CD8+,
and RelB multiplex immunoﬂuorescence staining, an Opal 7-color kit
(Akoya Biosciences, #NEL811001KT) was used according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. See Supplementary Data 4 for antibody
information.

Multiplex immunoﬂuorescent image acquisition and analysis
Immunoﬂuorescent slides and adjacent H & E sections were scanned
with the Vectra Polaris imaging system (Akoya Biosciences) following
the manual’s instructions, with high-power ﬁeld scan (×40) using the
ﬂuorescent mode and bright ﬁeld mode, respectively. The microscope
captured the multispectral ﬂuorescent spectra separately at the cor-
responding tyramide Opal ﬂuorophore wavelength, with preset
exposure times, and then these captures were stacked in 1 image
(QPTiff) without disrupting the unique ﬂuorescent spectral signature
of the markers. The QPTiff image was analyzed in Visiopharm software
for the regions of interest, necrosis, and tumor, for the entire section
from selected tumors.

Tuning strategies for cellular identiﬁcation and phenotyping
All digitized images were analyzed using the Visiopharm software
platform. Regions of interest (tumor and necrosis) were identiﬁed by a
deep-learning algorithm using adjacent H & E sections and were sub-
sequently overlayered to the corresponding ﬂuorescent slides in the
Visiopharm platform. For detecting nuclei, a pre-trained deep-learning
algorithm available with the Visiopharm platform (U-Net architecture)
was used. The convolutional neural network was trained to identify 3
components of the ﬂuorescent images: (a) DAPI+ nuclei; (b) boundaries
of DAPI+ nuclei; and (c) background. The algorithm magniﬁcation was
set to 20× to maximize the ability to capture details in the images.
Once nuclei in the sample were identiﬁed, the nuclear labels were
expanded by 5 pixels in all directions to approximate the boundaries of
cells, not just DAPI+ nuclei, to deﬁne the cytoplasm. Finally, the cell
segmentation was conﬁrmed via visual
inspection conducted by
trained personnel.

For phenotyping cells, a targeted approach to generate the spe-
ciﬁc list of phenotypes (i.e., biomarker combinations) was used. Spe-
ciﬁcally, we were interested in ﬁnding phenotypes that were positive
for a single biomarker (i.e., RelB, CD3+, or CD8+) and double positive
for 2 biomarkers (i.e., CD3+CD8+). For a given cell, the classiﬁcation of
each biomarker was gated using 2 independently controlled para-
meters: signal intensity and percent coverage. During the design of the

generalized classiﬁcation algorithm, classiﬁcation parameters were
iteratively adjusted to maximize accuracy and minimize the occur-
rence of false positives and false negatives for each biomarker. Bio-
marker classiﬁcations were visually inspected and conﬁrmed by
multiple researchers. Once the parameters for accurate classiﬁcation
were optimized, those settings were applied to all images. Once the
algorithms were applied to the images, a list of output variables,
including counts of each identiﬁed phenotype per region (i.e., tumor
and necrosis) was generated. For quantiﬁcation of the RelB nuclei/
cytoplasm ratio, 10 to 12 regions in the center of the tumor region from
3 sections from 3 different tumors per group (in total 57,370 and
78,073 cells) were randomly selected (Fig. 5d), and the spatial location
in Cartesian coordinates (e.g., center x and center y coordinates) for
each cell on the whole slide were generated. RelB mean ﬂuorescent
intensity (MFI) of the nuclei and RelB MFI of the whole cell were
extracted using Visiopharm for all the cells found in the region of
interest, and the RelB nuclei/cytoplasm ratio was calculated using the
following formula:

Relative RelB Nuceli=Cytoplasm Ratio

(cid:1)

=

Nuclei RelB MFI (cid:1) Whole Cell RelB MFI
Whole Cell RelB Mean Intensity

(cid:3)

(cid:3) 100

For T-cell phenotyping, the entire tumor area from each tumor
section (approximately 0.3–1.7 × 106 cells/section, a total of 4 tumor
sections from 4 different tumors per group) was selected (Fig. 5f, g).

Multiplexed ion beam imaging technology
Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) technology and service provided
by IONPATH (Menlo Park, California) were used for NK and dendritic
cell staining (Fig. 5h–m). For full details of the MIBI methods, see the
companion paper84. Brieﬂy, antibodies were conjugated to isotopic
metal reporters. Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections
were stained with metal isotope-labeled antibodies and then imaged
using time-of-ﬂight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The masses of
detected species are then assigned to target biomolecules given the
unique metal isotope label of each antibody, creating multiplexed
images. From each group, 12–13 regions of interest (ROIs) (800 μm ×
800 μm/ROI) of tumor areas were selected from each group
(3 tumors/group, 4–5 ROIs/tumor) using the corresponding H&E
images for guidance. Multiplexed image sets were extracted, slide
background-subtracted, denoised, and aggregate ﬁltered. Cell seg-
mentation takes advantage of the multiplexed nature of MIBI data by
combining the nuclear dsDNA signal with cytoplasmic and membrane
markers to accurately delineate and identify single cells in the tissue
image dataset. Cell classiﬁcation was performed with a machine
learning framework that exploits the morphology and intensity of
biomarkers to identify positive regions. For the markers present in the
panel, a set of deep-learning models was trained based on expert
annotation on a subset of data. These annotations capture the varia-
bility in staining patterns of the biomarkers in the tissues. Once
trained, the models were applied to all the images to yield a model
score for every segmented cell to be positive for biomarkers used to
phenotype cells. A probability threshold was chosen by the pathologist
for each biomarker based on a manual review of images. Cells with a
probability greater than the threshold were called positive for that
biomarker. Expression of markers was quantiﬁed at the single-cell level
using summed intensities. The accuracy of cell classiﬁcation was
visually veriﬁed by a pathologist. See Supplementary Data 4 for MIBI
antibody information.

Bulk RNA sequencing and analyses
Triplicated bulk RNA was isolated from each sample using the RNeasy
Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, # 74134), and then sequenced by Novogene
using an Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencer. The quality of the raw FASTQ

ﬁles was checked with the FASTQC package (https://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The TopHat pack-
age (2.1.1)85 or STAR (2.7.9a) was used to align the RNAseq data to the
human reference genome GRCh38 to generate bam ﬁles. The bam ﬁles
were sorted by Samtools software (1.8)86. The sorted bam ﬁles were
then converted to SAM ﬁles. HTSeq software (0.11.0)87 was used to
count the number of reads falling in the exonic regions of each gene.
The read counts represented the RNA expression level of each gene or
region. We combined the HTSeq read count results for each sample to
obtain the raw gene expression matrix data. We examined the matrix
to ﬁlter out genes with low overall read counts across samples (≤ 5
reads in all of the samples), which were not included in our group
comparisons. The data were normalized using the Variance stabilizing
transformation in the DESeq (1.34.0) package for R85. To identify dif-
ferentially expressed genes, a 2-sample t-test was used to determine
whether there was a signiﬁcant difference between each gene’s mean
expression level in the 2 groups. To adjust for multiple tests, we
applied the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure86. Genes with a false-
discovery rate (FDR) (q-value) less than or equal to 0.1 were considered
to be signiﬁcantly differentially expressed.

GSEA was conducted together with analysis of the molecular
signatures database (MSigDB) to determine biologically meaningful
gene sets that were enriched between the 2 biological conditions in the
comparisons88
(https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp). GSEA
analysis was conducted by using the Hallmark gene set (h.all.v7.0.-
symbols.gmt) as the gene set database89 (https://www.gsea-msigdb.
org/gsea/msigdb/human/genesets.jsp?collection=H) and performing
1000 permutations. GSEA calculates an enrichment score (ES) for each
gene set from the Hallmark database by ranking the user gene list
based on its degree of overrepresentation in one of the 2 groups being
compared. Highly ranked genes are overrepresented in one group,
while lower-ranked genes are overrepresented in the second one. The
degree of overrepresentation of each Hallmark gene set among higher
or lower-ranked genes deﬁnes its ES. A positive ES indicates enrich-
ment of a given gene set in one group, and a negative ES indicates
enrichment in the other group. To account for differences in the size of
the gene sets and in other variables and allow comparisons among
gene sets, the ES was normalized to a normalized ES (NES). In this
study, we used the NES to analyze and represent our data. Gene sets
were considered signiﬁcantly enriched at an FDR q-value < 0.25.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analyses
Data from OSCC patients from TCGA were used to evaluate our
molecular ﬁndings in a clinical context. Clinical data were retrieved
from Liu et al.90. The TCGA MC3 head and neck cancer mutation data
(MAF ﬁle)91 was retrieved using the R packages PoisonAlien/
TCGAmutations92
(https://github.com/PoisonAlien/TCGAmutations)
and MAFtools93 (https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools). RNAseq
data were recovered from the National Cancer Institute’s Genomic
Data Commons (GDC) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)94. We included
in our in silico cohort 221 patients with oral cavity tumors that were
HPV-negative and TP53 mutant and had whole-exome and RNAseq data
available. To validate our in silico ﬁndings, we retrieved genomic and
clinicopathological data from squamous carcinomas from TCGA95,96
(https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/PanCan-Squamous-
2018). We selected lung (n = 399) and larynx (n = 100) squamous cell
carcinoma samples, exhibiting TP53 mutations, and negative for HPV
infection95.

EMT scores for the selected samples were computed based on a
pan-cancer EMT signature. The signature was derived from TCGA
RNAseq data consisting of 11 tumor types (n = 1934 tumors). The
score was calculated by taking the difference between the average
of mesenchymal gene expression and the average of epithelial gene
expression97.
Immune features for the selected samples were

retrieved from Thorsson et al.98, which reported immunogenomic
characterization of all TCGA tumors. Immune enrichment scores
were calculated and considered as continuous variables in our
analyses. In order to estimate the enrichment of speciﬁc Hallmark
gene sets (h.all.v7.0.symbols.gmt) (https://data.broadinstitute.org/
gsea-msigdb/msigdb/release/7.0/) among the TCGA samples, we
used ssGSEA, an extension of GSEA. The algorithm calculates
separate ESs for each pairing of a sample and gene set. Each ssGSEA
ES represents the degree to which the genes in a particular gene set
are coordinately upregulated or downregulated within a sample.
The calculated ssGSEA scores for each Hallmark gene set were
treated as continuous variables in our analysis.

The generated data were analyzed using JMP 15.0 software. Hier-
archical clustering analysis was conducted using the Ward method for
deﬁning distances between clusters. Associations between categorical
variables and 5-year overall, disease-speciﬁc, and progression-free
survival were evaluated with the log-rank test. Associations between
categorical and continuous variables were tested by the Kruskal–Wallis
test followed by post hoc analysis using the Steel-Dwass test.
