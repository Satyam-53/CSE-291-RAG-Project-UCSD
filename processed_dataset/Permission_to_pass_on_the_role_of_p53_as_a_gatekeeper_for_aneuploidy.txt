Abstract  Aneuploidy—the  karyotype 
in 
which  the  number  of  chromosomes  deviates  from 
a  multiple  of  the  haploid  chromosome  set—is  com-
mon in cancer, where it is thought to facilitate tumor 
initiation and progression. However, it is poorly toler-
ated  in  healthy  cells:  during  development  and  tissue 
homeostasis,  aneuploid  cells  are  efficiently  cleared 
from  the  population.  It  is  still  largely  unknown  how 
cancer  cells  become,  and  adapt  to  being,  aneuploid. 
P53,  the  gatekeeper  of  the  genome,  has  been  pro-
posed  to  guard  against  aneuploidy.  Aneuploidy  in 
cancer  genomes  strongly  correlates  with  mutations 
in  TP53,  and  p53  is  thought  to  prevent  the  propaga-
tion of aneuploid cells. Whether p53 also participates 
in  preventing  the  mistakes  in  cell  division  that  lead 
to  aneuploidy  is  still  under  debate.  In  this  review, 
we  summarize  the  current  understanding  of  the  role

Introduction

Changes to the genome are rarely tolerated by healthy 
cells.  They  possess  elaborate  mechanisms  to  prevent 
accumulation of, for example, single nucleotide sub-
stitutions or copy number alterations (CNAs). CNAs 
can  appear  in  various  forms,  most  notably  focal  and 
arm-level  CNAs  (hereafter  referred  to  as  structural 
CNAs—sCNAs)  and  whole  chromosome  CNAs 
(hereafter  referred  to  as  numerical  CNAs—nCNAs). 
sCNAs  involve  copy  number  changes  to  parts  of 
chromosomes,  while  nCNAs  involve  gains  or  losses 
of entire chromosomes (Fig. 1). CNAs result mainly 
from errors in chromosome segregation during mito-
sis or meiosis, creating daughter cells with aneuploid 
karyotypes  (Gordon  et  al.  2012;  Sheltzer  and  Amon 
2011).  Aneuploidy—a  karyotype  state  in  which  the 
genome deviates from a multiple of the haploid set of 

chromosomes—is  highly  prevalent  in  cancer  (sCNA 
and/or  nCNA  are  present  in  ~  90%  of  tumor  sam-
ples),  where  ~  66%  of  all  tumor  samples  from  The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset carry at least 
one  nCNA  (Knouse  et  al.  2017;  Taylor  et  al.  2018). 
Aneuploidy  in  cancer  cells  is  a  genomic  manifesta-
tion of the increased rate at which cells mis-segregate 
chromosomes,  a  phenotype  known  as  chromosomal 
instability  (CIN).  CIN  is  prevalent  in  cancer  but  its 
frequencies  can  vary  greatly,  even  within  the  same 
tumor type (Lengauer et al. 1997; Bolhaqueiro et al. 
2019).  CIN  not  only  leads  to  aneuploidy  but  also 
drives karyotype heterogeneity in tumor cell popula-
tions  (Shoshani  et  al.  2021;  Sansregret  and  Swanton 
2017;  Watkins  et  al.  2020;  Bolhaqueiro  et  al.  2019). 
Depending  on  the  degree  of  CIN,  this  can  result  in 
opposing effects on tumor initiation and progression: 
while CIN can accelerate tumor evolution by creating 
favorable  karyotypes  that  increase  cancer  plasticity, 
fueling  metastasis  and  therapy  resistance  (Gerstung 
et  al.  2020;  Sansregret  and  Swanton  2017;  Watkins 
et  al.  2020;  Ben-David  and  Amon  2020;  Chunduri 
and Storchová 2019), it can also suppress tumor ini-
tiation or progression in several mouse models when 
induced  to  high  levels  (Sheltzer  et  al.  2017;  Godek 
et  al.  2016;  Rowald  et  al.  2016;  Silk  et  al.  2013; 
Hoevenaar et al. 2020; Zasadil et al. 2016). Selection 
pressure  for  CNAs  to  gain  or  lose  driver  oncogenes 
or  tumor  suppressor  genes,  respectively,  is  one  way 
in  which  the  tumor-promoting  effects  are  achieved 
(Davoli  et  al.  2013;  Sack  et  al.  2018;  Trakala  et  al. 
2021; Shih et al. 2023). For example, in a lymphoma 
mouse  model,  CIN  was  followed  by  clonal  selec-
tion  of  recurrent  CNAs  that  confer  a  proliferative 
advantage (Shoshani et al. 2021; Trakala et al. 2021), 
including gains of any chromosome (natural or engi-
neered)  that  carried  the  c-Myc  gene  (Trakala  et  al. 
2021).  As  a  result  of  selection  for  oncogenic  driv-
ers,  whole  chromosome  CNA  patterns  are  context-
dependent, being conserved within tumors of a tissue 
type but divergent between tumors of different tissues 
(Sack et al. 2018; Hoadley et al. 2018; Ben-David and 
Amon 2020; Davoli et al. 2013).

Intriguingly,  while  aneuploidy  is  common  in  can-
cer,  it  is  detrimental  to  cellular  fitness  (Sheltzer  and 
Amon  2011;  Ben-David  and  Amon  2020)  and  rare 
in  healthy  cells:  less  than  5%  of  cells  across  healthy 
tissues  are  aneuploid  (Knouse  et  al.  2014;  Chunduri 
and  Storchová  2019).  While  much  is  known  about

Fig. 1   Aneuploidy:  numerical  vs.  structural  CNAs.  Ane-
uploidy can arise from erroneous cell divisions. We define ane-
uploidy as a karyotype state in which the number of chromo-
somes deviates from a multiple of the haploid chromosome set. 
CNAs present in aneuploid cells can come in different flavors: 

numerical  CNAs  (nCNAs),  which  are  whole-chromosome 
gains or losses, and structural CNAs (sCNAs), which are sub-
chromosomal  gains  and  losses  ranging  from  arm-level  altera-
tions to smaller fractions of the genome (focal alterations)

how cancer cells circumvent the detrimental effects of 
mutations,  much  less  is  known  about  how  they  deal 
with aneuploidy. A prime candidate to guard against 
propagation  of  aneuploid  cells  is  p53,  a  transcrip-
tion  factor  with  a  central  role  in  ensuring  genome 
stability  by  responding  to  various  stresses  (Levine 
2020).  Inactivation  of  the  TP53  gene  at  early  stages 
of tumorigenesis, irrespective of tumor type, empha-
sizes  its  broad  role  as  a  tumor  suppressor  (Gerstung 
et al. 2020). p53 is referred to as the guardian of the 
genome,  and  in  line  with  this,  strong  co-occurrence 
of  aneuploidy  and  TP53  gene  inactivation  in  cancer 
suggests  that  p53  plays  a  role  in  guarding  against 
aneuploidy  (Taylor  et  al.  2018;  Ciriello  et  al.  2013). 
However,  the  interplay  between  aneuploidy  and  p53 
in  cancer  is  still  poorly  understood.  In  this  review, 
we  summarize  the  current  understanding  of  the  role 
of p53 activation in response to aneuploidy in healthy 
cells and explore the consequences of functional p53 
loss for propagation of aneuploidy in cancer.

TP53 gene mutations and aneuploidy in cancer

Several  large-scale  cancer  genome  analyses  showed 
that of all common oncogenic mutations, aneuploidy 

most  strongly  correlates  with  mutations  in  the  TP53 
gene  (Taylor  et  al.  2018;  Donehower  et  al.  2019; 
Hoadley et al. 2014; Ciriello et al. 2013; Davoli et al. 
2017;  Zack  et  al.  2013).  These  analyses  were  per-
formed on TCGA datasets, using a definition of ane-
uploidy  that  included  not  only  numerical  CNAs  but 
also  arm-level  and/or  focal  CNAs.  For  most  cancer 
types,  occurrence  of  CNAs  correlates  with  overall 
mutation  burden,  with  TP53  being  the  most  signifi-
cantly  associated  mutant  gene  (Taylor  et  al.  2018), 
and  higher  prevalence  of  TP53  mutations  correlates 
with  higher  frequencies  of  CNAs  (Hoadley  et  al. 
2014).  When  comparing,  within  cancer  types,  sam-
ples with mutations in TP53 to those without, CNAs 
are  enriched  in  the  cancers  carrying  TP53  muta-
tions.  This  is  irrespective  of  gains  or  losses  (Done-
hower  et  al.  2019).  Of  note,  since  the  definition  of 
aneuploidy  used  in  the  analyses  included  sCNAs,  it 
is  unclear  whether  TP53  mutations  correlate  with 
nCNAs. This is potentially relevant since events lead-
ing  to  sCNAs  are  expected  to  include  DNA  breaks 
and  activate  a  p53  response,  while  those  leading  to 
nCNAs are not necessarily expected to do so. It would 
thus  be  of  interest  to  re-assess  TP53  mutation  status 
in  relation  strictly  to  nCNAs.  Interestingly,  evidence 
of  whole-genome  doubling  (WGD)—the  duplication

of at least 50% of the current set of chromosomes—
is seen in 30–40% of all cancers, and it is correlated 
with  prior  loss  of  p53  function  in  more  than  half  of 
the cases (Gerstung et al. 2020; Bielski  et al. 2018). 
For example, in TCGA datasets, a subgroup of colo-
rectal  cancer  tumors  was  characterized  by  early  loss 
of  p53  and  WGD  (Kim  et  al.  2021).  WGD  is  con-
sidered  an  unstable  state  that  is  often  followed  by 
accumulation of sCNAs and nCNAs (Gerstung et al. 
2020). Overall, both TP53 mutations and aneuploidy 
are  prevalent  in  tumors  and  show  intriguing  correla-
tions, which may signal causal links between the two.

The role of p53 in maintaining genome stability

To  better  understand  the  correlation  between  TP53 
gene  mutations  and  aneuploidy  in  cancer,  we  first 
look  at  p53’s  role  as  the  guardian  of  the  genome. 
During  interphase,  p53  can  respond  to  a  plethora  of 
cellular  stresses,  including  DNA  damage,  oxidative 
stress, replication stress, and hypoxia (Gambino et al. 

2013; Bieging et al. 2014). This response ensures that 
only cells with an intact genome progress into mito-
sis, which is widely regarded as a main reason for the 
tumor  suppressor  function  of  p53  (Liebl  and  Hof-
mann  2021;  Boutelle  and  Attardi  2021;  Janic  et  al. 
2018).  The  various  intricacies  of  the  regulation  and 
function of p53 have been extensively reviewed else-
where (Kastenhuber and Lowe 2017; Kruiswijk et al. 
2015); for the context of this review, we will briefly 
outline what is known about p53 activation and con-
sequent outcomes in response to an insult.

In  healthy  cells,  p53  is  maintained  at  low  levels 
by  interaction  with  MDM2,  which  targets  p53  for 
ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Fig. 2). Therefore, 
activation of p53, for example, in response to DNA 
damage,  is  achieved  by  disrupting  this  interaction, 
leading  to  p53  protein  stabilization  and  regulation 
of target genes (Chène 2003; Levine 2020) (Fig.  2). 
DNA  breaks  activate  the  DNA  damage  response 
mediated by the ATM/CHK2 pathway, culminating 
in  phosphorylation  of  p53  and  MDM2  (Abuetabh 
et  al.  2022;  Banin  et  al.  1998;  Chène  2003;  Maya 

Fig. 2   Regulation  of  p53.  In  physiological  conditions,  p53 
interacts  with  its  negative  regulator  MDM2,  an  E3  ubiquitin-
protein ligase, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. 
Upon  stress,  upstream  factors  impinge  on  the  p53-MDM2 
interaction by inhibiting MDM2 function (e.g., target for deg-
radation,  phosphorylation  of  interaction  site,  cleavage,  inhibi-

tion by interaction with other proteins (e.g., LATS1/2 or ribo-
some  biogenesis  subunits)).  P53  can  also  be  directly  targeted, 
for example, by phosphorylation, to reduce affinity for MDM2. 
Disruption of MDM2-p53 interaction stabilizes p53 and leads 
to p53 activation in response to specific insults. Ub, ubiquitin

et  al.  2001).  Phosphorylation  of  p53  and  MDM2 
lowers  the  affinity  for  each  other,  resulting  in  p53 
stabilization  (Banin  et  al.  1998;  Maya  et  al.  2001) 
(Fig. 2). The activation of the p53 pathway upon an 
insult can lead to distinct cell fates: cell cycle arrest, 
apoptosis, or senescence (Hafner et al. 2019). What 
determines  a  specific  outcome  upon  p53  activation 
in  response  to,  e.g.,  DNA  damage  depends  on  sev-
eral  variables.  First,  different  tissues  can  express 
different  isoforms  of  p53,  expressed  through  alter-
native  splicing.  Although  still  poorly  understood, 
different  isoforms  present  distinct  functions  that  in 
turn  affect  the  outcome  of  p53  responses  (Joruiz 
and  Bourdon  2016).  Second,  post-translational 
modifications of the p53 protein, particularly phos-
phorylation,  can  significantly  affect  the  degree  of 
protein stability (via MDM2), conformation, locali-
zation,  or  affinity  for  binding  partners  (Liu  et  al. 
2019). These modifications can also determine p53 
transcriptional  activity  and  consequently  the  cell 
fate:  for  example,  while  acetylation  of  p53  at  resi-
due K382 increases its activity after sustained DNA 
damage,  a  transient  source  of  DNA  damage  leads 
to  inhibition  of  p53  activity  through  methylation 
at the same residue (Loewer et al. 2010). Likewise, 
glucose deprivation can lead to G1 cell cycle arrest 
via p53: MDH1—an enzyme involved in glycolysis 
and  mitochondrial  respiration—stabilizes  p53  by 
impinging  on  p53-MDM2  interaction  and  triggers 
post-translational  modifications  (acetylation  and 
phosphorylation) that determine p53 activation (Lee 
et al. 2009; Kruiswijk et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2023). 
Third,  p53  temporal  dynamics  can  strongly  deter-
mine  cell  fate  (Jiménez  et  al.  2022;  Purvis  et  al. 
2012). Pulsatile p53 dynamics govern activation of 
p53 depending on the level of stress induced: while 
high  levels  of  DNA  damage  lead  to  sustained  p53 
response  and  apoptosis,  low  levels  of  DNA  dam-
age result in a pulsed activation and milder effects, 
such as cell cycle arrest (Mönke et al. 2017; Purvis 
et  al.  2012).  Additionally,  p53-dependent  cell  fate 
decisions hinge on pulsing activity of upstream and 
downstream players (Jiménez et al. 2022; Batchelor 
et  al.  2008;  Hanson  et  al.  2019;  Paek  et  al.  2016; 
Stewart-Ornstein and Lahav 2017).

To  summarize,  the  cellular  stress  response  path-
ways  commonly  impinge  on  the  regulation  of  the 
interaction  between  p53  and  MDM2  (Fig.  2),  and, 
although  highly  complex  and  not  fully  understood, 

their effect on p53 activation and cell fates depend on 
the level of stress and the context of the affected cell 
(Vousden and Prives 2009; Mönke et al. 2017).

TP53 mutations: a cause of aneuploidy?

The role of p53 in maintaining genome stability and 
its  frequent  inactivation  in  aneuploid  cancers  raises 
the possibility that loss of p53 can cause aneuploidy 
(Table  1;  Fig.  3).  In  support  of  this,  TP53  knockout 
human intestinal organoids display CIN (Drost et al. 
2015).  This  may  be  an  indirect  effect  of  the  role  of 
p53  in  protecting  cells  from  entering  mitosis  with 
damaged  DNA  (Fig.  3)  (Bunz  et  al.  1998).  Simi-
larly, deletion of TP53 in an acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML)  cell  line  leads  to  CIN  and  aneuploidy  (Caz-
zola  et  al.  2019).  Recently,  human  gastric  organoids 
carrying  TP53  gene  mutations  and  followed  for 
genome alterations over a 2-year period showed pro-
gressive and ordered accumulation of CNAs that are 
recurrently  observed  in  gastric  tumors,  establishing 
a  strong  causal  connection  between  TP53  mutations 
and recurrent CNAs in cancer (Karlsson et al. 2023).

How might loss of p53 cause aneuploidy? Mouse 
embryonic  fibroblasts  lacking  p53  have  amplified 
centrosomes,  as  a  result  of  misregulated  CDK2/
cyclin-E  compromising  the  centrosome  duplication 
cycle  (Fukasawa  et  al.  1996;  Liu  et  al.  2004;  Tara-
pore  et  al.  2001).  Interestingly,  likely  due  to  a  more 
stringent regulation of cyclin-E, loss of p53 in human 
non-transformed  cells  does  not  lead  to  centrosome 
amplification (Kawamura et al. 2004). Yet there is an 
intriguing correlation between p53 loss and supernu-
merary  centrosomes  in  human  cancers  (Lopes  et  al. 
2018;  Fukasawa  2005;  Chan  2011).  Supernumerary 
centrosomes  can  lead  to  CIN  by  creating  multipo-
lar  spindles  that  predispose  cells  to  lagging  ana-
phase  chromosomes,  resulting  in  aneuploid  progeny 
(Silkworth et al. 2009; Ganem et al. 2009) (Table 1; 
Fig. 3). In agreement with this, cells in human TP53 
knockout  hepatocyte  organoids  display  multipolar 
spindles (Artegiani et al. 2020). Loss of p53 can also 
predispose cells to WGD by allowing the survival of 
cells that underwent cytokinesis failure (Baslan et al. 
2022; Fujiwara et al. 2005; Tommasi et al. 2011). An 
additional mechanism may involve cytokinesis failure 
as a result of DNA damage-induced anaphase bridges 
at  the  cleavage  furrow  (Andreassen  et  al.  2001a,  b;

Fig. 3   Consequences of p53 loss. Cells that lose p53 function 
can  become  aneuploid  by  various  means,  including  supernu-
merary  centrosomes,  DNA  damage,  and  altered  proliferation 
and  cellular  surveillance  mechanisms.  Supernumerary  cen-
trosomes can result in multipolar spindles and/or lagging chro-
mosomes, causing CNAs and WGD. Unresolved DNA damage 

can  contribute  to  replication  stress  and  mitotic  errors  (e.g., 
chromosome  anaphase  bridges)  likely  resulting  in  structural 
CNAs  (sCNAs)  or  WGD.  The  combination  of  p53  loss  with 
alterations in driver genes affects proliferation and surveillance 
mechanisms, resulting in aneuploid progeny with sCNA and/or 
numerical CNAs (nCNA)

Bunz et al. 1998; Bakhoum et al. 2017; Janssen et al. 
2011)  (Table  1;  Fig.  3).  WGD  can  further  promote 
CIN:  in  most  cancers  with  evidence  of  early  WGD, 
subsequent  near-triploidy  and  extensive  CNAs  are 
common  (Gerstung  et  al.  2020;  Knouse  et  al.  2017; 
Storchova  and  Pellman  2004;  Storchova  and  Kuffer 
2008; Baslan et al. 2022; Dewhurst et al. 2014; Zeng 
et al. 2023).

Contrasting  these  observations  are  studies  report-
ing  that  TP53  mutations  are  not  sufficient  to  cause 
aneuploidy:  monolayer  cancer  or  non-transformed 
cell  lines  often  remain  diploid  after  p53  deletion/
inactivation  (Simoes-Sousa  et  al.  2018;  Bunz  et  al. 
2002;  Haruki  et  al.  2001).  Loss  of  p53  in  HCT116 

cells induces CIN only when combined with the loss 
of p73 (Schmidt et al. 2021) or loss of pRB (Manning 
et al. 2014), and the CIN seen upon TP53 knockout in 
human intestinal organoids was not accompanied by a 
significant increase in aneuploidy (Drost et al. 2015) 
(Table 1).

What  could  explain  the  seemingly  contradictory 
findings  about  the  appearance  of  aneuploid  cells 
upon  p53  inactivation?  TP53  knockout  in  an  AML 
cell  line  resulted  in  appearance  of  aneuploid  cells 
containing both sCNAs and nCNAs (Cazzola et  al. 
2019).  Conversely,  cells  with  functional  p53  can 
accumulate some nCNAs but rarely sCNAs. In line 
with  this,  inducing  CIN  in  p53-proficient  HCT116

or  RPE1  cells  resulted  in  cycling  aneuploid  cells 
with  mostly  whole-chromosome  gains  (e.g.,  triso-
mies),  while  most  whole-chromosome  losses  and 
sCNAs could be detected only when p53 was inac-
tivated (Soto et al. 2017; Chunduri et al. 2021). So, 
like the analysis of cancer genome datasets, the dis-
crepancy  may  lie  in  the  definition  of  aneuploidy: 
even  though  nCNAs  survive  better  in  p53-inacti-
vated cells, it is possible that loss of p53 leads pre-
dominantly to sCNAs rather than nCNAs.

In  vivo  p53-deficient  germline  mouse  models 
display CIN and aneuploidy in tissues such as lym-
phoid  (thymus,  bone  marrow,  and  spleen)  (Fuka-
sawa  et  al.  1997;  Funk  et  al.  2021)  and  intestine 
(Funk  et  al.  2021)  (Table  1).  Likewise,  inducible 
loss  of  p53  in  mouse  esophagus  progenitor  cells 
leads  to  accumulation  of  giant  poly-aneuploid  like 
cells—aneuploid  cells  that  have  undergone  WGD 
(Murai  et  al. 2022).  Nevertheless,  oncogenic  trans-
formation  in  vivo  upon  p53  loss  happens  predomi-
nantly  in  blood  cells  (lymphomas)  and/or  con-
nective  tissue  (sarcomas),  and  these  cancers  are 
aneuploid  (Funk et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2004; Tom-
masi et al. 2011; Chi et al. 2009; Baker et al. 2009; 
Foijer  et  al.  2014)  (Table  1).  Induction  of  CIN  by 
deleting  the  spindle  assembly  checkpoint  (SAC) 
kinases  Mps1  or  Bub1  in  mice  heterozygous  for 
functional  p53  (p53  +  / −)  accelerated  loss  of  het-
erozygosity (p53 − / −) and the development of ane-
uploid  lymphomas  (Foijer  et  al.  2014;  Baker  et  al. 
2009)  (Table  1).  Other  in  vivo  p53  mutant  cancer 
models  also  show  aneuploidy,  but  loss  of  p53  was 
often  combined  with  additional  oncogenic  events. 
Examples  include  transgenic  Wnt  overexpression 
(mammary  cancer)  (Donehower  et  al.  1995),  Kras 
mutation  (pancreatic  cancer)  (Baslan  et  al.  2022), 
or  spontaneous  c-Myc  overexpression  (lymphoma) 
(Fukasawa et al. 1997) (Table  1, Fig. 3). The com-
bination of multiple factors makes it challenging to 
dissect  the  contribution  of  loss  of  p53  alone  to  the 
development of aneuploidy in these tissues.

To summarize, depending on the model and condi-
tions (species, culture or tissue type, additional onco-
genic  alterations),  p53  loss  by  itself  can  cause  ane-
uploidy. Whether this is a result of increased CIN or 
of a higher probability of survival of aneuploid cells 
in vivo is unclear. Resolving this requires single cell 
analysis  of  CIN  and  aneuploidy  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
upon acute inactivation of p53.

A healthy cell’s response to aneuploidy

TP53 mutations correlate with aneuploidy in cancer, 
but as outlined earlier, it is unclear whether p53 loss 
can  directly  cause  chromosome  segregation  errors. 
Moreover, loss of functional p53 does not invariably 
lead  to  aneuploidy.  Instead,  loss  of  p53  might  be  a 
permissive  characteristic  for  propagation  of  aneu-
ploidy. In order to explore this possibility we will first 
outline how healthy cells respond to aneuploidy.

Aneuploidy-induced stresses

Aneuploidy  is  rare  in  healthy  cells  (Knouse  et  al. 
2014;  Chunduri  and  Storchová  2019).  Cells  are  pro-
tected from becoming aneuploid by various cell cycle 
checkpoints  (e.g.,  replication  or  chromosome  segre-
gation  checkpoints)  (Chunduri  and  Storchová  2019; 
Gaillard et al. 2015; McAinsh and Kops 2023), and if 
somehow  cells  escape  such  checkpoints  and  become 
aneuploid,  they  appear  to  be  eliminated  from  the 
population. Immune surveillance can drive the elimi-
nation of senescent aneuploid cells, mostly mediated 
by natural killer cells (Santaguida et al. 2017; Wang 
et  al.  2021).  Whether  immune  cells  can  recognize 
specifically aneuploid cells, and if so how, is largely 
unknown.  Aneuploidy  induces  severe  stresses  that 
cause  a  substantial  fitness  decline  (Sheltzer  et  al. 
2017; Wang et al. 2021; Santaguida et al. 2017; Zhu 
et  al.  2018;  Gordon  et  al.  2012;  Sheltzer  and  Amon 
2011;  Torres  et  al.  2007;  Williams  et  al.  2008).  As 
extensively  reviewed  elsewhere  (Chunduri  and  Stor-
chová 2019; Gordon et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2018), ane-
uploidy can cause DNA damage (Janssen et al. 2011; 
Sheltzer et al. 2011; Passerini et al. 2016), replication 
stress (Ohashi et al. 2015; Passerini et al. 2016; Gar-
ribba  et  al.  2023),  proteotoxic  stress  (Ohashi  et  al. 
2015; Santaguida and Amon 2015b; Oromendia et al. 
2012;  Torres  et  al.  2007),  hypo-osmotic  stress  (Tsai 
et  al.  2019),  metabolic  stress  (Stingele  et  al.  2012; 
Foijer  et  al.  2014),  lysosomal  stress  (Santaguida  and 
Amon 2015a; Santaguida et al. 2015), and an inflam-
matory response (Santaguida et al. 2017; Wang et al. 
2021). These often lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cell 
death.  The  mechanisms  by  which  aneuploidy  causes 
these  stresses  are  not  completely  resolved,  but  have 
been  elucidated  in  some  cases.  Aneuploid  cells  can 
accumulate DNA damage as a result of DNA breaks 
on lagging chromosomes or anaphase bridges, or from

mis-segregated chromosomes that end up in micronu-
clei, which are prone to rupture and exposure  of the 
entrapped  chromosome  to  cytoplasmic  exonucleases 
(Umbreit et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2015; Janssen et al. 
2011; Hatch et al. 2013). Through imbalances in gene 
content from nCNAs, aneuploidy can affect transcrip-
tion  and  translation  (Chunduri  and  Storchová  2019), 
leading to, for example, a shortage of replication fac-
tors (such as MCM2–7) that in turn induce replication 
stress  and  cause  DNA  damage  in  under-replicated 
regions  (Passerini  et  al.  2016;  Garribba  et  al.  2023). 
Although  dosage  compensation  mechanisms  exist  in 
aneuploid cells to negate the protein imbalances that 
result from chromosome gains (Stingele et al. 2012), 
they  suffer  from  proteotoxic  stress:  imbalances  in 
protein  complex  stoichiometries  put  a  strain  on  pro-
tein  folding  and  degradation  machineries,  leading  to 
aggregation  of  misfolded  proteins  in  the  cytoplasm 
(Chunduri  and  Storchová  2019).  Interestingly,  aneu-
ploidy-induced stresses are not the same for all types 
of  CNAs,  given  that,  for  example,  monosomies  do 
not  induce  proteotoxic  stress  (Chunduri  et  al.  2021). 
Therefore, further efforts are needed to elucidate the 
mechanisms  by  which  CNAs  trigger  the  aforemen-
tioned stress responses.

p53 pathway response to aneuploidy

The overlap in stresses that arise from aneuploidy and 
those  that  activate  p53  raises  the  question  whether 
p53 is activated in response to aneuploidy and hence 
may  impact  the  fate  of  aneuploid  cells.  Indeed,  sev-
eral studies have shown that p53 can be  activated  in 
response  to  CIN  and/or  aneuploidy  (Table  2).  This 
can  occur  regardless  of  the  strategy  used  to  induce 
CIN.  For  example,  disrupting  the  SAC,  alone  or  in 
combination  with  disrupting  chromosome  congres-
sion  (by  inhibiting  MPS1),  the  master  kinase  of  the 
SAC, − / + the mitotic kinesin CENP-E) in RPE-1 or 
HCT116  cells  leads  to  sCNAs  and  nCNAs  followed 
by  p53  activation  and  consequent  cell  cycle  arrest 
(Santaguida et al. 2017; Soto et al. 2017; Narkar et al. 
2021; Janssen et al. 2011; Simoes-Sousa et al. 2018; 
Li et al. 2010) (Table 2). Similarly, induction of WGD 
in RPE-1 cells also causes cell cycle arrest mediated 
by  p53  (Crockford  et  al.  2017;  Ganem  et  al.  2014; 
Gemble  et  al.  2022),  and  mitotic  arrest-and-release 
strategies  induce  p53  activation  after  mis-segrega-
tion events and result in cell cycle arrest (Thompson 

and  Compton  2010;  Dalton  et  al.  2010).  P53  acti-
vation  has  also  been  observed  in  cell  lines  derived 
from mouse models of CIN (Li et al. 2010; Silk et al. 
2013). However, aneuploidy does not invariably lead 
to p53 activation in monolayer cultures. For example, 
certain nCNAs or low levels of aneuploidy can propa-
gate  in  p53-proficient  RPE-1  cells  (Soto  et  al.  2017; 
Santaguida  et  al.  2017),  and  even  high  aneuploidy 
levels can lead to cell cycle arrest in a p53-independ-
ent manner (Santaguida et al. 2017).

Additionally, a recent study using 3D cultures fur-
ther challenged the hypothesis that p53 is activated in 
response  to  aneuploidy  (Table  2).  While  p53  activa-
tion and cell cycle arrest upon chromosome mis-seg-
regation was seen in monolayer cell cultures, no p53 
activation  was  seen  in  either  mouse  colon  or  human 
mammary 3D organoid cultures (Narkar et al. 2021). 
In  this  study,  chromosome  segregation  errors  in  the 
organoids  were  not  accompanied  by  DNA  damage, 
which may in part explain the lack of a p53 response 
and    is  in  line  with  the  requirement  for  p53  inacti-
vation  in  the  accumulation  of  sCNAs,  as  described 
earlier. Another possibility is that, since tissue archi-
tecture was proposed to be essential for chromosome 
segregation  fidelity  (Knouse  et  al.  2018),  this  may 
also  somehow  impact  the  p53  response.  However, 
growing  HCT116  cells  in  3D  did  not  alter  the  p53 
response (Narkar et al. 2021), although it is debatable 
to  what  extent  such  cancer  cells  grown  in  3D  reca-
pitulate  tissue  architecture.  A  point  of  consideration 
is  the  components  of  the  medium  used  for  organoid 
culture that might affect cellular responses: in human 
organoid  lines  specifically,  p38  inhibitors  are  often 
used  which  might  inhibit  aneuploidy-induced  stress 
response  mediated  by  p38–p53  activation  (Simoes-
Sousa et al. 2018). Nonetheless, the 3D culture study 
emphasizes the importance of examining whether p53 
is activated in response to aneuploidy in vivo. To our 
knowledge,  while  p53  activation  has  been  detected 
in  fibroblasts  derived  from  mouse  cancer  models  of 
CIN/aneuploidy,  it  has  not  been  examined  directly 
in  vivo  or  in  tissues  of  such  models.  Interestingly, 
p53  activation  and  elimination  of  aneuploid  cells  in 
mouse  brains  upon  induction  of  CIN  were  reported 
in the context of mouse embryonic development (Shi 
et al. 2019).

Taken  together,  the  inconsistent  observations  of 
a  p53  response  to  aneuploidy  in  monolayer  cultures 
and the lack of p53 response observed in 3D organoid

cultures  expose  a  gap  in  our  understanding  of  the 
mechanisms  by  which  cells  respond  to  and  surpass 
aneuploidy-induced  stresses  and  the  role  of  p53  in 
this.

The mechanisms of p53 activation by aneuploidy

The observation that aneuploidy, at least in monolayer 
cultures,  often  results  in  p53  activation  raises  the 
question  of  the  underlying  mechanism.  We  envision 
two possibilities: either p53 senses aneuploidy per se 
or it senses the stresses that result from aneuploidy.

Direct sensing of aneuploidy by p53

The first possibility is supported by a study reporting 
that  cells  sense  lagging  or  misaligned  chromosomes 
by  marking  them  with  phosphorylation  of  histone  3 
(H3.3) on serine at position 31 (Ser31), which in turn 
activates p53 by an unknown mechanism (Hinchcliffe 
et al. 2016). Ser31 of H3.3 can be phosphorylated by 
the  DNA  damage  response  kinase  CHK-1  in  cancer 
cells  that  rely  on  the  alternative  lengthening  of  tel-
omeres (ALT) pathway (Chang et al. 2015), although 
in  the  aforementioned  study  p53  activation  from 
H3.3.  Ser31  phosphorylation  was  apparently  inde-
pendent  of  DNA  damage  (Hinchcliffe  et  al.  2016). 
Alternatively,  H3.3  Ser31  can  be  phosphorylated  by 
the  mitotic  kinase  Aurora  B  (Li  et  al.  2017),  which 
is  active  at  the  cell’s  midzone  during  anaphase  and 
telophase (Fuller et al. 2008) and as such might mark 
a  lagging  chromosome.  Paradoxically,  however,  one 
study  showed  that  Aurora  B  can  phosphorylate  p53 
at centromeres, resulting in accelerated p53 degrada-
tion (Gully et al. 2012). It thus remains unclear how 
H3.3-Ser31  is  phosphorylated  on  mis-segregated 
chromosomes or how that impacts p53, and no subse-
quent studies have addressed this. P53 has also been 
reported  to  respond  directly  to  mitotic  defects  that 
are  connected  to  prolonged  mitosis:  a  pool  of  p53 
(phosphorylated  at  Ser15)  located  at  centrosomes  is 
released in the cytoplasm upon centrosome fragmen-
tation during mitosis and recruits 53BP1, that in turn 
activates a mitotic surveillance pathway composed of 
53BP1 and USP28 (Contadini et al. 2019). Similarly, 
a study proposed the existence of a “stopwatch” com-
posed of USP28, 53BP1, and p53 that limits the pro-
liferation of daughter cells that arise after a prolonged 

mitosis (Meitinger et al. 2016). A new pre-print study 
suggests  that  this  “stopwatch”  is  a  result  of  gradual 
MDM2 degradation that eventually leads to p53 acti-
vation in the following G1 (Fulcher et al. 2023). p53 
has also been proposed to participate in a “tetraploidy 
checkpoint” in G1, able to detect and limit the prolif-
eration of tetraploid cells. This concept resulted from 
the  observation  that  newly  formed  tetraploid  cells 
(generated by chemical induction of cytokinesis fail-
ure)  would  arrest  in  G1  in  a  p53-dependent  manner 
(Andreassen et al. 2001a, b). However, the existence 
of such a checkpoint was challenged by other studies 
showing that G1 cell cycle arrest was not an obliga-
tory  outcome  in  tetraploid  cells  (Uetake  and  Sluder 
2004;  Wong  and  Stearns  2005).  Taken  together,  the 
evidence  for  p53  as  a  direct  sensor  of  the  aneuploid 
state is currently thin.

Indirect sensing of aneuploidy by p53

In the second possibility, p53 senses the stresses that 
result  from  aneuploidy  (Fig.  4).  The  observation 
that low levels of aneuploidy do not activate p53 but 
higher  aneuploidy  levels  do  lead  to  p53  activation, 
cell cycle arrest, and senescence supports this notion 
(Li  et  al.  2010;  Santaguida  et  al.  2017).  Although 
there is currently little evidence for it, cells with low 
CIN levels in vivo may escape p53 surveillance mech-
anisms,  while  those  with  high  CIN  levels  may  elicit 
a  p53-mediated  apoptosis  response,  with  differential 
outcomes on tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2010). If indeed 
p53  is  activated  in  response  to  aneuploidy-induced 
stresses, there is likely a threshold for p53 activation 
upon a mis-segregation event (Santaguida et al. 2017; 
Soto et al. 2017), much like the thresholds proposed 
to dictate p53 response dynamics and cell fates upon 
DNA damage (Mönke et al. 2017; Loewer et al. 2010; 
Paek  et  al.  2016).  A  “just  right”  level  of  aneuploidy 
might then be sufficiently high to promote tumorigen-
esis while being sufficiently low to allow escape from 
p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

As  said,  there  is  substantial  overlap  between 
stresses  known  to  activate  p53  and  those  elicited  by 
aneuploidy.  Are  all  of  them  part  of  the  mechanism 
by  which  aneuploidy  triggers  p53  activation,  or  do 
some  contribute  more  than  others?  This  question  is 
largely  unanswered.  The  clearest  link  between  ane-
uploidy-induced  stress  and  p53  activation  is  again 
DNA damage, as described earlier (Fig. 4). CIN and

Fig. 4   P53 activation in 
response to aneuploidy-
induced stresses. Ane-
uploidy-induced stress 
responses often impinge on 
p53 activation by disrupting 
p53-MDM2 interaction. A 
Replication stress and DNA 
damage activate ATM, 
which can directly phos-
phorylate MDM2 or p53. B 
Metabolic stress and pro-
longed mitosis can trigger a 
p38 stress response, which 
indirectly targets MDM2 for 
degradation. C Prolonged 
mitosis can also activate 
CASP2, which can cleave 
MDM2. (D) Supernumer-
ary centrosomes, often 
co-occurring with WGD, 
can trigger the PIDDosome 
(mediated by CASP2) or 
(E) the Hippo pathway: 
LATS1/2 binds MDM2 and 
reduces its affinity for p53. 
(F) Monosomies cause defi-
cient ribosome biogenesis, 
which creates imbalances 
in ribosomal proteins, some 
of which then interact with 
MDM2 and reduce its 
affinity for p53. Although 
poorly understood, (G) the 
presence of cytoplasmatic 
DNA triggers p53 activa-
tion which in turn medi-
ates the activation of the 
cytoplasmatic DNA sensing 
machinery (cGAS/STING) 
for immune activation

WGD  commonly  cause  DNA  damage  with  ensuing 
p53 activation (Janssen et al. 2011; Santaguida et al. 
2017;  Soto  et  al.  2017;  Dalton  et  al.  2010;  Krzy-
wicka-Racka  and  Sluder  2011;  Kuffer  et  al.  2013; 
Ganem  et  al.  2014;  Gemble  et  al.  2022).  The  fact 
that  DNA  damage  underlies  sCNAs  (Janssen  et  al. 
2011; Li et al. 2010; Santaguida et al. 2017) and that 
sCNAs  are  eliminated  in  p53-proficient  cells  (Soto 
et  al.  2017;  Dalton  et  al.  2010;  Cazzola  et  al.  2019) 
suggests that aneuploidy-associated DNA damage, at 
least in part, explains the p53 response to aneuploidy. 

In fact, loss of p53 or DNA damage repair genes (e.g., 
MLH1  and  MSH2)  lead  to  accumulation  of  sCNAs 
and  single  nucleotide  alterations,  suggesting  that 
p53  acts  mostly  through  the  DNA  damage  response 
to prevent propagation of sCNAs (Janic et al. 2018). 
Although  likely,  for  most  of  the  other  aneuploidy-
related  stresses  like  metabolic  stress,  replication 
stress,  hypo-osmotic  stress,  proteotoxic  stress,  and 
autophagy  stress,  there  is  currently  no  evidence  that 
they  are  a  crucial  intermediate  between  aneuploidy 
and  p53.  Examining  this  requires  assessment  of  p53

activity  (dynamics)  following  aneuploidy  after  spe-
cific  elimination  of  one  type  of  stress.  This  would 
also  help  understanding  how  p53  limits  the  survival 
of cells that acquire nCNAs, since nCNAs, in contrast 
to sCNAs, are less likely to accumulate DNA breaks. 
Of note, for one type of nCNA the mode of p53 acti-
vation seems resolved: monosomies are incompatible 
with  functional  p53.  This  is  likely  due  to  defects  in 
ribosome biogenesis (Chunduri et al. 2021). Because 
ribosomal genes are spread across the genome, mono-
somies  cause  imbalances  in  ribosomal  protein  com-
plexes, some of which can interact with MDM2  and 
activate  the  p53  response  (Lindström  et  al.  2022) 
(Fig.  4).  Some  DNA  damage-independent  mecha-
nisms have been proposed to link CNAs to p53 acti-
vation  (Fig.  4).  p38  works  side  by  side  with  p53  to 
limit progression of cells in response to stress stimuli. 
Upon  mis-segregation  events,  p38  causes  apoptosis, 
at least in part through p53 stabilization and suppres-
sion  of  HIF-1α  (a  master  regulator  of  the  hypoxia 
response)  (Simoes-Sousa  et  al.  2018).  P38  has  been 
shown  to  indirectly  target  MDM2  (unknown  mecha-
nism) leading to p53 stabilization (Zhang et al. 2021) 
(Fig.  4).  Similarly,  a  postmitotic  stress  response 
by  p38–p53  can  trigger  p53-dependent  cell  cycle 
arrest  in  G1  after  prolonged  mitosis  or  mitotic  slip-
page  without  proper  cytokinesis  (Uetake  and  Sluder 
2018; Vogel et al. 2004). In Drosophila, the p38–p53 
axis  participates  in  the  response  to  metabolic  stress 
induced by ROS formation as a consequence of CIN 
(Clemente-Ruiz et al. 2016). Recently, p53 was linked 
to the activation of the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/
STING  pathway  (Ghosh  et  al.  2023).  Micronuclei 
formed  after  a  mis-segregation  event  are  prone  to 
rupture,  leading  to  accumulation  of  cytosolic  DNA 
that  can  trigger  cGAS/STING  activation  (Kwon 
et  al.  2020)  (Fig.  4).  In  the  presence  of  cytosolic 
DNA,  p53  induces  the  degradation  of  the  exonucle-
ase  TREX1  (a  DNA  degrading  enzyme),  leading  to 
the  accumulation  of  cytosolic  DNA  and  consequent 
detection by the sGAS/STING pathway (Ghosh et al. 
2023).  P53  can  also  limit  proliferation  of  cells  with 
supernumerary  centrosomes  after  WGD  (Ganem 
et  al.  2009;  Darp  et  al.  2022)  through  activation  of 
the  Hippo  pathway  (Ganem  et  al.  2014)  or  the  PID-
Dosome  (a  caspase-2  activator)  (Ganem  et  al.  2009; 
Fava et al. 2017) (Fig. 4). Activation of CASP2 (cas-
pase-2)  in  response  to  CNAs,  mitotic  delay  or  DNA 
damage  during  mitosis,  causes  MDM2  cleavage, 

p53  stabilization,  and  thus  aneuploid  cell  clearance 
through mitotic cell death (Fig. 4) (Dawar et al. 2017; 
Lopez-Garcia  et  al.  2017;  Castedo  et  al.  2004;  Lim 
et al. 2021). In colorectal cancer cell lines, repression 
of  CASP2  activity  by  loss  of  BCL9L  (a  component 
of  Wnt  signaling  pathway)  allowed  survival  of  CIN 
cells (Lopez-Garcia et al. 2017). In summary, several 
mechanisms  can  lead  to  p53  activation  upon  a  mis-
segregation event in vitro. However, more studies are 
necessary  to  clarify  both  the  mechanisms  of  activa-
tion  of  p53  and  the  outcomes  thereof  in  response  to 
aneuploidy in 3D and in vivo.

Conclusions and future outlook

P53  participates  in  a  complex  network  of  cellular 
responses  to  diverse  stresses.  As  we  discuss  in  this 
review, many of these stresses overlap with the ones 
induced  by  aneuploidy.  It  is  clear  that  p53  activa-
tion is a recurrent outcome of aneuploidy but not an 
obligatory  one  as,  for  example,  nCNAs  can  propa-
gate  in  p53  proficient  cells.  Nevertheless,  loss  of 
p53  creates  a  more  permissive  context  for  prolifera-
tion  of  aneuploid  cells  when  compared  to  p53  pro-
ficient  counterparts  (Salehi  et  al.  2021;  Adell  et  al. 
2023;  Fujiwara  et  al.  2005).  Therefore,  there  is  still 
much  to  learn  about  how  exactly  aneuploidy  trig-
gers  p53  and  how  p53  limits  survival  of  aneuploid 
cells  (Fig.  5).  Some  outstanding  questions  remain: 
first, does p53 get activated in response to aneuploidy 
in  vivo?  The  fact  that  loss  of  p53  in  vivo  promotes 
survival of aneuploid cells suggests a role for p53, but 
direct evidence for p53 activation in response to ane-
uploidy  in  vivo  is  scarce.  Given  the  absence  of  p53 
response in mouse- and human-derived 3D organoid 
cultures,  it  will  be  important  to  examine  direct  p53 
activation in aneuploid cells in 3D organoid cultures 
and validate it in in vivo models of CIN/aneuploidy. 
Second,  it  is  currently  unknown  whether,  and  if  so 
how,  different  types  of  mitotic  errors  (e.g.,  lagging 
chromosomes,  chromatin  bridges,  supernumerary 
centrosomes,  micronuclei)  trigger  p53  activation. 
A  major  distinction  seems  to  be  between  errors  that 
lead  to  sCNAs  vs.  nCNAs:  whereas  nCNAs  are  still 
tolerated to some extent in cells with functional p53, 
sCNAs often arise in p53-deficient cells. It will there-
fore  be  very  informative  to  re-assess  the  correlation 
between TP53 mutations and nCNAs. Third, it is still

largely elusive whether p53 can work as a direct sen-
sor for aneuploidy. Can p53, for example, be directly 
activated by a mis-segregating chromosome? Or is it 
perhaps more indirectly activated when a threshold is 
exceeded of the fraction of the genome that is altered 
(e.g., when more than 20% of the genome is gained or 
lost)? It could be of added value to use directed whole 
chromosome  mis-segregation  strategies  such  as  Kar-
yoCreate (Bosco et al. 2023) to explore whether p53 
responds  to  a  threshold  of  mis-segregation  events 
(e.g.,  gene  content,  fraction  of  genome  altered),  in 
the  absence  of  DNA  damage.  Lastly,  it  is  also  unre-
solved  how  different  types  of  aneuploidy-induced 
stresses  result  in  p53  activation.  A  direct  link  has 

been  established  between  DNA  damage  responses 
and occurrence of sCNAs, but no other stresses were 
individually  tested  as  mandatory  intermediates  for 
p53 activation in aneuploid cells. Understanding what 
mechanisms limit proliferation of aneuploid cells can 
open up therapeutic opportunities to target aneuploid 
tumor cells.

Most consequences of aneuploidy seem to impinge 
on the p53 pathway. However, p53 alterations are pre-
sent  at  a  pan-cancer  frequency  of  approximately  41% 
while aneuploidy is present in ~ 90% of solid tumors, 
as obtained from TCGA database (Hoadley et al. 2014; 
Gerstung et al. 2020). This suggests that p53-proficient 
cells  can  propagate  aneuploidy  by  either  overcoming 

Fig. 5   P53  as  a  gatekeeper  for  aneuploidy.  In  healthy  cells 
(A),  aneuploidy-induced  stresses  activate  a  p53  response, 
which  prevents  the  propagation  of  aneuploid  cells  and  causes 
their  cell  cycle  arrest  or  death.  In  cancer  cells,  however,  ane-
uploidy as well as p53 mutations are highly prevalent. In p53 
mutant  cancer  cells  (B)  (~  41%  with  TP53  gene  mutations) 
(Hoadley  et  al.  2014),  aneuploid  cells  can  proliferate  with 
low/moderate  levels  of  aneuploidy.  Propagation  of  replication 
stress, for example, can induce DNA damage and consequently 
further  promote  CIN.  This  leads  to  increased  heterogene-
ity,  which  enables  selection  of  optimal  karyotypes.  Approxi-

mately  59%  of  tumors  are  WT  for  p53  (C).  In  these  tumors, 
aneuploidy can still be propagated by either developing mecha-
nisms to surpass p53 activation (e.g., cyclin D1/2 upregulation 
in WGD) or by upregulating mechanisms to prevent accumula-
tion of genomic instability (GIN) (e.g., upregulate DNA dam-
age response pathways). As a result, such cells are more likely 
to accumulate numerical CNAs (nCNAs), mostly gains, while 
cells  with  structural  CNAs  (sCNAs)  and/or  monosomies  are 
probably eliminated or overtaken by cells with more beneficial 
karyotypes

p53 activation or through p53-independent mechanisms 
(Fig.  5).  For  example,  tetraploid  human  tumors  (47% 
of which are wild-type for p53) (Crockford et al. 2017) 
can  upregulate  cyclin  D1/2  which  in  turn  sequesters 
p21,  a  downstream  effector  of  p53,  resulting  in  con-
tinued  proliferation  (Potapova  et  al.  2016;  Crockford 
et al. 2017). Likewise, loss of BRG1, part of a chroma-
tin  remodeling  complex,  also  seems  to  overcome  p53 
activation in aneuploid cells by upregulating cyclin D1 
(Schiavoni et al.  2022). In another example, upregula-
tion  of  HIF-1α  can  inhibit  post-mitotic  apoptosis  and 
potentiate tolerance to aneuploidy in a p53-independent 
manner (Simoes-Sousa et al.  2018). Even if p53 itself 
is intact, alterations to components of the p53 network 
can  also  allow  cells  to  overcome  p53  pathway  activa-
tion.  For  example,  CDKN2A  (encoding  for  p21)  is  a 
known cancer driver, frequently altered at early stages 
of  tumor  development  (Donehower  et  al.  2019;  Gers-
tung  et  al.  2020).  Additionally,  selection  of  sCNAs  or 
nCNAs  that  affect  genes  involved  in  the  p53  network 
can  be  another  way  by  which  aneuploid  cells  surpass 
p53  activation.  In  line  with  this,  trisomy  of  chromo-
some  1q,  recurrently  present  in  cancer,  leads  to  over-
expression of MDM4 that in turn inhibits p53 function 
(Girish et al. 2023). Interestingly, gain of chromosome 
1q was shown to be mutually exclusive with mutations 
in TP53. Likewise, deletion of CDKN2A and amplifica-
tion of MDM2 are mutually exclusive with TP53 altera-
tions  in  glioblastoma  multiforme  cancers  (Donehower 
et  al.  2019).  Finally,  since  aneuploid  cells  can  trigger 
further  genomic  instability  (Sheltzer  et  al.  2011;  Pas-
serini et al. 2016), another way to adapt to aneuploidy 
might be by preventing accumulation of stresses (Clem-
ente-Ruiz et al. 2016; Clarke et al. 2022). For example, 
aneuploid  cells  can  improve  DNA  replication  by  acti-
vating DDK-mediated firing and mitotic DNA synthe-
sis  (MIDAS),  in  order  to  cope  with  replication  stress 
and maintain mitotic fidelity (Garribba et al.  2023). It 
will be of great interest to examine in detail the general 
response  to  aneuploidy  in  p53  proficient  cells  and  the 
pathways that such cells use to overcome aneuploidy’s 
detrimental effects. Given the prevalence of aneuploidy 
in cancer, such insights will likely reveal new targetable 
vulnerabilities of aneuploid cells.
