TP53 mutations are recognized to correlate with a worse prognosis in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There
exists an immediate necessity to pinpoint selective treatment for patients carrying TP53 mutations. Potential drugs were identiﬁed
by comparing drug sensitivity differences, represented by the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), between TP53 mutant
and wild-type NSCLC cell lines using database analysis. In addition, clinical data from NSCLC patients were collected to evaluate
both their TP53 status and their response to gemcitabine, thereby facilitating further validation. Subsequently, NSCLC cell lines with
different TP53 status (A549 and H1299) were subjected to gemcitabine treatment to investigate the association between TP53
mutations and gemcitabine response. According to the dataset, NSCLC cell lines carrying TP53 mutations displayed heightened
sensitivity to gemcitabine. From a clinical standpoint, patients exhibiting TP53 hotspot mutations demonstrated prolonged overall
survival upon gemcitabine treatment. In vitro, overexpressing various hotspot TP53 mutations signiﬁcantly sensitized H1299 cells to
gemcitabine. Moreover, the knockdown of TP53 in A549 cells notably augmented sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment, as
evidenced by cell viability and reproductive cell death assays. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type TP53 in H1299 cells led to
an increased resistance against gemcitabine. Gemcitabine is a treatment option for patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) who carry TP53 hotspot mutations. This potential effectiveness might arise from its ability to disrupt DNA damage repair
processes, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest or an augmentation of mitotic abnormalities, eventually cause cell death. As a
result, when planning treatment strategies for NSCLC patients possessing TP53 hotspot mutations, gemcitabine should be
considered to incorporate into the indication.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide [1].
inﬂuence over lung cancer
Genetic alternations wield a pivotal
treatment strategies. Targeted therapies, such as EGFR, ALK, and
ROS1 inhibitors, have become the standard of care for actionable
gene alterations. Nevertheless, the presence of other mutations,
like TP53, might curtail the responsiveness to targeted interven-
tions. Notably, TP53 mutations have been detected in around 52%
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although certain
early clinical trials are currently evaluating the efﬁcacy of TP53-
mutant inhibitors, their clinical applicability remains pending [2].

TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, plays a crucial

role in
forestalling malignant cell formation. Research has indicated that
TP53 mutations can manifest at varying phases of cancer initiation
and progression [3]. In some instances, TP53 mutations may be
present in the early stages of cancer development and act as an
initiating event. In other cases, these mutations may occur later in
the process and contribute to the progression and metastasis [4].
A noteworthy association has been established between TP53
mutations and unfavorable prognoses, as well as an elevated
probability of treatment resistance [5, 6]. Consequently, compre-
hending the impact of TP53 mutations on cancer development

Fig. 1 Gemcitabine response in NSCLC cells with TP53 mutations. A The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database highlights TP53 as one of
the most frequently mutated genes in adenocarcinoma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). B Data extracted from the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database reveals the mutation frequency of TP53 in NSCLC adenocarcinoma. TP53 mutations encompass 55% of cases, including
40.7% missense mutations, 11% truncating mutations, and 3.3% splice mutations. C A scatter plot illustrates the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values for gemcitabine treatment in NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell lines categorized as TP53 wild-type (WT), harboring
hotspot mutations, or non-hotspot mutant. The data suggests potential variations in gemcitabine sensitivity based on TP53 mutational status.

and progression has emerged as a pivotal focus within oncological
research [7].

TP53 hotspot mutations are speciﬁc alterations that occur at
certain codon residues in the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53
tumor suppressor protein. These hotspot mutations are observed
in various human cancers [8]. The most frequently occurring TP53
hotspot mutations are distributed in the DNA-binding domain of
for its tumor suppressor
the p53 protein, which is essential
function. These mutations can disrupt the DNA-binding ability of
the p53 protein, leading to the loss of its ability to regulate the cell
cycle and prevent
the formation of cancer cells. The most
common TP53 hotspot mutations include R175H, R248W, R273H,
and R282W, which occur at residues 175, 248, 273, and 282,
respectively [9]. These mutations have been extensively studied
and have been shown to be associated with a wide range of
cancer types. Understanding the speciﬁc effects of TP53 hotspot
mutations on the function of the p53 protein is crucial
for
developing targeted cancer therapies that can effectively treat
cancers harboring these mutations. Therefore, ongoing research in
this area is critical for advancing our understanding of cancer
biology and for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cancer
treatment.

Concurrently with the quest for TP53 mutation inhibitors, an
alternative avenue involves the identiﬁcation of existing drugs
capable of targeting these mutations, either directly or indirectly.
In the CONKO-001 phase III clinical trial, sequencing data from
patients indicated that TP53 mutations could serve as predictive
indicators for gemcitabine treatment efﬁcacy in pancreatic cancer
[10]. This discovery serves as a pivotal launching point for further
substantiating the gemcitabine-TP53 mutations relationship across
diverse cancer types. Moreover,
it provides insights into the
underlying mechanics of this drug-mutation interplay.

Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog of deoxycytidine (2,2-
diﬂuorodeoxycytidine, dFdC),
inhibits cell proliferation during
interphase via masked chain termination, thus interfering with
DNA synthesis [11]. It is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent
in combination with other cytotoxic agents for the treatment of
various types of cancer [11]. Gemcitabine monotherapy or in
combination with cisplatin has achieved a response rate of
18–26% in advanced NSCLC patients [12]. Working as a prodrug,
gemcitabine necessitates cellular uptake and subsequent phos-
phorylation into triphosphate diﬂuorodeoxycytidine to integrate
into the DNA chain during the S phase. Research has indicated

correlations between altered SLC29A1, CDA, and RRM1 protein
metabolism and patient responsiveness to gemcitabine treatment.

The expression of hENT1, a cellular

biomarker for gemcitabine-based therapies in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma patients [13, 14].

mutations, can be classiﬁed into several functional categories
according to their impact on the p53 protein. These categories
encompass
structural/conformational mutations, DNA-binding
domain mutations, contact domain mutations, tetramerization
domain mutations, and hotspot mutations. Hotspot mutations
pertain to speciﬁc nucleotide alterations that occur at higher
frequencies within TP53. These mutations tend to cluster in
speciﬁc gene regions, leading to amino acid substitutions. Codons
encoding amino acids R175, G245, R248, R249, R273, and R282
were classiﬁed as hotspot mutations in concordance with the IARC
dataset [17], as elucidated in “Methods”. These mutations often
associate with increased p53 malfunction and are recurrently
observed across diverse cancer types.

database. Our analysis indicated that gemcitabine possesses
considerable potential as a therapeutic agent against
lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines harboring TP53 mutations. In compar-
ison to TP53 wild-type cell lines, both TP53 hotspot mutant and
non-hotspot mutant cell lines exhibited heightened sensitivity to
gemcitabine, yielding P values of 0.028 and 0.025, respectively
(Fig. 1C).

Correlation between cellular prediction and clinical response
In a bid to establish a correlation between cellular prediction and
clinical response, we conducted sequencing of 275 commonly
implicated cancer-related genes across 39 patients. Among them,
22 patients received ﬁrst-line gemcitabine while 17 patients
received later-line gemcitabine. The comprehensive gene muta-

predominant mutation types (Fig. 2A). Functionally, the most
noteworthy alterations encompassed missense, nonsense, frame-
shift, and splice site mutations (Fig. 2B and Supplement Table 2).
In alignment with TCGA datasets, TP53 stood out with the highest
overall mutation frequency in our cohort, being present in 14 out
of 22 patients (64%). A total of 15 distinct TP53 mutations were
detected (Fig. 2C and Supplement Table 3). These TP53 mutations

Subsequently, our patients were classiﬁed into three groups, as
detailed earlier: the TP53 hotspot mutant group, the TP53 non-

gemcitabine response rate, the TP53 hotspot mutation group
exhibited a higher tendency in comparison to the TP53 non-
hotspot and TP53 wild-type groups (100%, 41.7%, 35.7%, P value:

Sensitivity of TP53 hotspot and null mutated cells to
gemcitabine
To ascertain the susceptibility of TP53 hotspot mutations to
gemcitabine, we introduced various TP53 hotspot mutations and
wild-type variants into the H1299 TP53-Null cell line. This allowed
us to evaluate cellular viability in response to gemcitabine
treatment. Notably, TP53 mutations frequently occur within the
DNA-binding domain, with speciﬁc codons (175, 245, 248, 249,
273, and 282) consistently identiﬁed as “hotspot” codons. These
hotspot mutations are divided into two distinct groups: those
inﬂuencing p53 protein conformation (175, 245, 249, 282) and
those impacting DNA contact domain (248, 273) [18]. Moreover,
the majority of hotspot mutations result in the loss of p53 wild-
type functions (loss-of-functions, LOF), while certain mutations
acquire new oncogenic activities independently of p53 wild-type
(gain-of-function, GOF).

Given the intricate nature of p53 mutations, we selected three
distinct hotspot mutations for investigation into their effects on
NSCLC cells under gemcitabine treatment. Speciﬁcally, the two
most prevalent hotspot mutations, R248W and R273H, located in
the DNA contact domain, along with R175H, which disrupts
protein conformation in p53, were overexpressed in the H1299
TP53-Null cell
line using lentiviral transfection. The efﬁcacy of
expression was veriﬁed via western blot analysis (Fig. S1).

Comparative analysis revealed that when compared to H1299
TP53-wild-type (WT) cells, the viability of cells carrying hotspot
mutations, including TP53-R248W, R273H, and R175H, was notably
lower. Of signiﬁcance, TP53-R248W exhibited an approximately
threefold lower IC50 (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, this speciﬁc hotspot
mutation codon was also detected in an NSCLC patient who
displayed a partial response to gemcitabine treatment in our
patient sequence data.

However, in terms of cytotoxicity following 72 h, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in gemcitabine’s effect on H1299 TP53-
R175H cells compared to and H1299 TP53-WT cells, hinting at
varied impacts of different TP53 mutations on cell growth
regulation. Analogous outcomes were observed in colony
formation over a 10-day period under gemcitabine treatmB).
Notably, H1299 TP53-WT cells exhibited the highest resistance
to treatment. Conversely, H1299 cells with other TP53 hotspot
mutations showcased signiﬁcantly greater sensitivity to treat-
ment than H1299 TP53-WT cells. Intriguingly, H1299 TP53-Null
cells displayed the highest sensitivity to treatment, with
minimal colony formation evident even at the lowest dose of
treatment.

Collectively, these ﬁndings highlight that hotspot mutations,
including TP53-R248W, R273H, and R175H, exhibit heightened
sensitivity to gemcitabine compared to TP53-WT cells. Further-
it is evident that TP53-Null cells manifest the greatest
more,
sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, due to the

for different TP53 hotspot mutations overexpressed in H1299 cells, as determined by the SRB assay, were signiﬁcantly lower than those for

than that of H1299 TP53-WT cells. Notably, the R248W mutation, which was found in patients with partial responsiveness to gemcitabine
(Table 1), exhibited the highest sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment among the hotspot mutations. The data presented in the graphs are

the density of 800 cells/well for 7 days. While spheroids formed, gemcitabine was added to the medium for 1 to 3 days. To investigate the
effects of gemcitabine on H1299 spheroids, three different concentrations were used, 5 μM, 10 μM and 20 μM. Cell morphology was observed

hotspot mutated H1299 cells. These cells are functionally devoid
of p53, in accordance with the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) TP53 database. To validate this hypothesis, we
embarked on TP53 knockdown experiments using the A549, a
human NSCLC cell line. Through lentiviral infection, we success-
fully established stable A549 TP53-knockdown lines. Subsequent
western blotting conﬁrmed the successful knockdown of TP53 in
these lines (Fig. S1A).

Our ﬁndings revealed that A549 TP53-knockdown cells dis-
played greater sensitivity to gemcitabine compared to TP53 wild-
type cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, gemcitabine treatment induced a
more pronounced reduction in colony formation ability among
TP53-knockdown cells in comparison to TP53 wild-type cells (Fig.
5B). Substantiating these observations, BrdU cell proliferation
assays demonstrated that gemcitabine more effectively inhibited
the proliferation of TP53 knockdown cells than that of TP53 wild-
type cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, our data indicated a correlation
between gemcitabine resistance and RRM1 expression [19]. RRM1
is a component of ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase, a crucial
enzyme for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis [20]. The diphosphory-
lated form of gemcitabine inhibits this enzyme, thus reducing
nucleotide production. Notably, RRM1 expression in A549 TP53-
knockdown cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon
gemcitabine treatment, while no such change was observed in
A549 TP53 wild-type cells (Fig. 5D).

Similarly, H1299 TP53-Null cells exhibited signiﬁcantly lower cell
viability and diminished colony formation capacity within 5 days
in response to dose-dependent gemcitabine treatment.
In
contrast, H1299 TP53-WT cells demonstrated a tendency toward
increased resistance to gemcitabine treatment, particularly at
lower doses (Fig. 5E).

Collectively, our data underscore the crucial

role of p53
functional deﬁciency in sensitizing NSCLC cells to gemcitabine
treatment. This insight provides valuable implications for under-
standing the intricate interplay between p53 status and gemci-
tabine response in the context of NSCLC.

DNA damage accumulation induced by p53 ablation in NSCLC
cells upon gemcitabine treatment
Gemcitabine, a DNA damage-inducing agent, generates tripho-
sphate adducts that lead to masked chain termination during
interphase, ultimately resulting in double-strand DNA breaks. To
comprehensively understand the enhanced sensitivity of p53-
deﬁcient cells
to gemcitabine, we conducted a series of
investigations. Our ﬁrst approach involved immunoﬂuorescence
staining to detect γ-H2AX (S139), a marker for permanent DNA
damage, followed by quantiﬁcation of γ-H2AX (S319) levels using
ﬂow cytometry. Notably, both TP53-deﬁcient A549 and H1299 cells
exhibited elevated γ-H2AX (S319) signals (Fig. 6A–C). Conversely,
TP53 wild-type overexpressed cells displayed diminishing γ-H2AX
(S319) signals in a dose and time-dependent manner, indicative of
increased DNA damage repair in these cells.

In the context of DNA damage response pathways,

two
canonical signaling cascades are pivotal:
the ATM-CHK2-p53
pathway for double-strand breaks and the ATR-CHK1 pathway
for single-strand breaks. Our western blot ﬁndings indicated a key

role for ATM-CHK2-p53 signaling in the response to gemcitabine-
induced DNA damage. Notably, levels of phosphorylated CHK2 (p-
CHK2 S19) markedly increased in both H1299 and A549 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Notably, H1299 TP53-Null cells exhibited
higher levels of p-CHK2, reﬂecting a feedback response due to the
incapacity to induce p53 (Fig. 6D).

In addition,

Conversely, there was negligible change in p-CHK1 (S317)
levels in A549 cells, while a slight increase was noted in H1299
cells (Fig. 6D).
the DNA repair marker PARP
demonstrated signiﬁcant induction in p53-WT cells compared to
p53 knockdown cells (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, the protein expres-
sion levels of p53 and its downstream effector, p21, exhibited
substantial upregulation in A549 cells. Exogenous overexpression
of p53 in H1299 cells similarly led to a dose-dependent increase
in p21 expression upon gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 6F). Of note,
the hyperphosphorylated upper band of p21 in H1299 cells was
observed. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence that
the ATM-CHK2-p53-p21 signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in
the DNA damage response induced by gemcitabine, facilitating
DNA repair.

Induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death by p53
downregulation after gemcitabine-induced DNA damage
To assess whether the accumulated DNA damage perturbed cell
cycle progression and leads to cancer cell death, which attribute
to the diminished cell viability and reduced colony formation
observed in TP53-deﬁcient cells following gemcitabine-induced-
DNA damage, we evaluated cell cycle at 48 and 72 h in H1299
TP53-Null and overexpressed TP53-WT cells. Intriguingly, in TP53-
WT cells,
the proportion of cells in G0/G1, S, G2/M phase

However, an elevated G2/M phase proportion of cells was
observed in H1299 TP53-Null cells in a dose-dependent manner,
alongside a considerable increase in the sub G1 population
compared to TP53-WT cells (Fig. 7B, D). Cyclin B1, which typically
degrades before mitotic exit, highly accumulated in TP53-null cells,
indicating mitotic arrest and contributing to mitotic defects.
Simultaneously, phosphorylation of CDK1 at T161 was reduced in
TP53-null cells but not in TP53-WT cells (Fig. S3A). Furthermore,
there was a signiﬁcant increase in the sub-G1 cell population in a

apoptosis pathway. For TP53-WT cells, apoptosis cell population
only increased at higher dose after 72 h treatment. Besides, an
increase in the sub G2/M population ( > 4 N) was observed in
TP53-Null cells, although it was not statistically signiﬁcant,
suggesting that few cells experienced mitotic failure, possibly
leading to cell death pathways. In A549 TP53-knockdown cells, we
also observed the induction of multinucleated cells after 96 h
under treatment of low-dose gemcitabine by immunostaining
with antibodies against pericentrin, α-tubulin, and DAPI (Fig. S2).
Noticeably, mitotic kinase Aurora-A was downregulated in TP53-
null cells but increased in wild-type cells (Fig. S3A).

Collectively, these ﬁndings underscore that the disruption of
p53 function, in conjunction with gemcitabine treatment, leads to
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase or results in mitotic defects,
ultimately driving cells to undergo apoptosis.

Potential mechanism of TP53-mutation-mediated sensitivity
of gemcitabine in NSCLC
To elucidate the molecular signature associated with TP53
mutations in LUAD, we analyzed the transcriptomic data from
the TCGA-LUAD dataset. Patients were categorized into TP53-
mutant and wild-type groups, and followed by gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify differentially regulated
pathways. The data revealed that several classical pathways
signiﬁcantly upregulated in TP53-mutant LUAD patients were
inhibited by gemcitabine, based on transcriptomic data from the
CLUE platform. Speciﬁcally, pathways related to cell growth,
division, and DNA damage response were upregulated in TP53-
mutant patients

In addition to these classical pathways, the analysis revealed

Furthermore, gemcitabine was associated with inhibitors of cell
proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis, including JAK inhibi-
tors, SRC inhibitors, BCL inhibitors, proteasome pathway LOF,
HDAC inhibitors,
IKK inhibitors, and VEGFR inhibitors [26, 27].
These connections underscore gemcitabine’s potential role in
modulating critical cancer-related pathways. Finally, the connec-
tivity proﬁle from the CLUE platform revealed several gene
knockdowns producing effects similar to gemcitabine treatment
(Fig. 8C). These genes are involved in the pathways upregulated in
TP53-mutant LUAD patients,
suggesting potential molecular
targets through which gemcitabine modulates these pathways.

Clinical applications and future goals
Based on the aforementioned, there is an increasing trend in
gemcitabine sensitivity associated with p53 gene mutation. We
aim to apply this conclusion to cancer patients in the clinical
setting. By establishing 3D models, we can mimic the tumor
environment within the human body without the need for animal
or human trials (Fig. 9A). Through genetic sequencing, we can
identify patients who are better suited for gemcitabine che-
motherapy, particularly those with p53 mutations or deletions.
This approach is expected to reduce lengthy and erroneous drug
trials, achieve a more efﬁcient cancer suppression effect, and
contribute to the goal of precision medicine (Fig. 9B).

DISCUSSION
This study sheds light on the response of lung cancer cells and
lung cancer patients with TP53 hotspot mutations to gemcitabine
treatment in comparison to those with TP53 wild-type mutations.

on cell cycle progression and apoptosis in H1299 TP53-Null cells. Cell cycle analysis by ﬂow cytometry is performed on both H1299 TP53 wild-

H1299 TP53-Null cells, as reﬂected in the altered cell cycle distribution and the population of cells in various phases. The observed effects of
gemcitabine treatment are compared between H1299 TP53-WT and TP53-Null cells. Statistically signiﬁcant differences are indicated by
asterisks in the graphs.

recent

research has shown that

mutations result in a poorer prognosis when employing targeted
therapies [28]. Notably,
the
combination of chemotherapies with targeted therapy yields
increased survival rates in contrast to targeted therapies alone
[29]. Despite this, the optimal chemotherapy to be paired with
targeted therapies remains undetermined. The present study may
suggest that gemcitabine could be an effective regimen for
treating NSCLC patients with TP53 hotspot mutations. Further
clinical trials are essential to validate the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine
against TP53 hotspot mutations.

P53 is a well-known regulator of the cell cycle in normal cells,
playing a crucial regulatory role in various cell signaling pathways
such as the cell cycle, intrinsic cell apoptosis, and DNA damage
repair, all pivotal for maintaining genomic stability [30].
It can
arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S, activating the process of DNA
repair. It can also initiate apoptosis on irreversible DNA damage
[31, 32]. Thus, TP53 is viewed as a tumor suppressor. The majority
of mutations of TP53 in human cancers are missense mutations
[33]. Only a single nucleotide alternate with another one leading
to the amino acid substitutions. The p53 protein contains 393
residues and forms several
including the
transactivation domain, proline-rich region, core DNA-binding
domain, tetramerization domain, and the negative regulatory
domain [34]. The cancer-associated TP53 mutations are diverse in
their locations and affect the thermodynamic stability of the p53
protein. In addition, the majority of missense mutations cause the
loss of DNA-binding function and therefore the transcription
function to activate the targeted downstream genes. Of the
mutations in this domain, about 30% fall within 6 hotspot residues
(R175, G245, R248, R249, R273, and R282) and are frequently

functional domains,

observed in various cancers [35]. The functional consequences of
these alternations encompass loss-of-function, dominant-negative
effects, and gain-of-function alterations [36]. Hence, this study
sought to establish a TP53 mutant spectrum that might inﬂuence
the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine treatment. Our patient’s response data
to gemcitabine treatment suggests a potential for higher response
rates in patients with hotspot mutations. We began with the most
prevalent mutations (R273H, R175H, and R248W) in NSCLC. These
mutations fall within the top 30% of hotspot residues found in
human cancers and are commonly associated with a loss of
transactivation function. Nevertheless, some studies have pro-
posed that
they may also confer gain-of-function properties
contributing to cancer progression [37–41].

An interesting observation is the substantial

reduction in
sensitivity in H1299 TP53-Null cells and H1299 TP53-R248W,
accompanied by a minor sensitivity decrease in H1299 TP53-
R273H, compared to H1299 TP53-WT cells. Conversely, H1299
TP53-R175H exhibited a sensitivity proﬁle similar to that of H1299
TP53-WT. Although all these hotspot mutations lead to a loss of
transactivation function, distinct mutation patterns could yield
differing effects on gemcitabine treatment
responses. The
enhanced susceptibility of these cells to gemcitabine can be
attributed to the disruption in p53 function, a conclusion that is
further supported by our experiments involving A549 TP53
knockdown cells (Fig. 5A–D).

Through in vitro validation using an NSCLC cell line model, we
have shown that the downregulation of p53 correlates with
heightened sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment. TP53 wild-type
cells exhibited lower levels of DNA damage relative to TP53
knockdown cells due to reversible cell cycle arrest during the G1/S

apoptosis pathway by inducing the cleavage of PARP-1.
In
intrinsic pro-apoptotic caspases like caspase 9 and
addition,
caspase 3 were triggered to mediate cell death signaling.
Consequently, gemcitabine treatment induced notably greater
DNA damage in TP53-knockdown cells compared to TP53-WT cell
(Fig. 6A–C). Our ﬁndings further highlighted that
the p53-
mediated enhancement of p21 and PARP-1 prompted the
initiation of cell cycle arrest, followed by DNA damage repair
consequent to gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 6F, G). Upon pro-

cycle arrest. Persistent γ-H2AX levels in TP53-null cells, in contrast
to their decline in TP53-WT cells, underscore the sustained DNA
damage response caused by p53 loss. Although the regulatory
mechanisms governing these markers remain unclear, prior
studies suggest a potential role for CHK2. Besides, gemcitabine
treatment in TP53-knockdown cells resulted in reduced Rb protein
levels,
indicating a loss of G1/S phase control and increased
susceptibility to DNA damage.

Building on these ﬁndings, we observed that the inability of
TP53-null cells to repair DNA damage during replication caused by
gemcitabine treatment
led to their progression into mitosis.
However, these cells became arrested at the G2/M phase due to

likely due to the downregulation of mitotic kinases such as Aurora-
A, which impaired chromosome segregation. This disruption
might trigger alternative cell death pathways, including mitotic
catastrophe [42, 43].

In order to further assess other possible mechanisms, our
transcriptomic analysis of the TCGA-LUAD dataset revealed key
molecular alterations associated with TP53 mutations in LUAD. By
performing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identiﬁed
several key pathways that were differentially regulated between

Complementing these ﬁndings, transcriptomic data from the CLUE
platform demonstrated that gemcitabine treatment in cancer cell
lines strongly connected to the inhibition of pathways upregu-
lated in TP53-mutant LUAD patients (Fig. 8B). Notably, several
classical pathways involved in the cell cycle, DNA damage
response, and cell growth showed strong connectivity between
gemcitabine and TP53-mutant patients. These ﬁndings align with
the known roles of TP53 in regulating the cell cycle and DNA
repair, suggesting that TP53 mutations may drive aberrant cellular
processes that support

regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell
migration, and cell cycle progression, was signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated in TP53-mutant patients. A key ﬁnding from our analysis is
the novel link between gemcitabine and the Rho GTPase signaling
pathway, suggesting a potential mechanism through which
gemcitabine may impact these cellular processes [46]. In cancer,
the Rho GTPase pathway is frequently dysregulated, promoting
enhanced cell proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis. Targeting
this pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, as
modulating it can disrupt cancer cell motility and invasiveness. In
lung cancer, Rho GTPases, especially RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, play
key roles in tumor progression and metastasis [46, 47]. Therefore,
these data suggest that gemcitabine may potentially modulate
the Rho GTPase pathway, contributing to its anticancer efﬁcacy.
This study has several limitations. First, the number of patients
with TP53 mutations included in our study is limited. In addition,
the majority of patients underwent gemcitabine treatment at a
later stage of
therapy, which could potentially impact
gemcitabine response in patients harboring TP53 mutations.
Second, given the intricate nature of TP53 mutations and their
variability, cell line models may not fully represent the genomic
diversity of all patients. Thus, this study requires further extension
to encompass various mutation groups. Third, the interaction
between drugs and cancer cells within the tumor microenviron-
ment could be another factor inﬂuencing drug response. As a
result, our predictive biomarkers should be further validated in
diverse models, particularly through patient tissue analyses.
In
future research, we intend to amass more patient samples
subjected to gemcitabine treatment to clinically conﬁrm the
sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed biomarkers.

METHODS
Dataset
(GDSC) database was
The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
employed as our data source, encompassing interactions involving 516
compounds and 310 genetic alterations across 73 NSCLC cell lines. The
primary objective was to identify a putative drug. This was achieved by
comparing IC50 values of diverse compounds against distinct cell lines.

Cell culture
Human NSCLC cell lines, A549 and H1299, were procured from ATCC. A549
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (PS) at 37 °C within a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Likewise,
H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% PS, also maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2
environment.

3D spheroid culture
lines, A549 and H1299 were seeded onto the R3CE
Human NSCLC cell
(Acrocyte Therapeutics Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan) 3D culture platform
and supplied with complete medium cultured for 7–10 days. The 3D
culturing condition was conducted according to the previous cell culturing
methods. The cell morphology was observed using Olympus IX83 inverted
microscope before and after drug treatments.

Gemcitabine response evaluation
To assess the sensitivity of both A549 and H1299 cell lines to gemcitabine,
the viability of TP53-knockdown and TP53 wild-type A549 cells was initially
examined via Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays after administering gemci-
tabine for 48 and 72 h, respectively.

TP53 knockdown
A549 cells exhibit a moderate level of p53 protein expression. shRNAs were
procured from the RNAi Core (Academia Sinica), used pLKO.1 vector and
featured the ensuing sequences: non-splicing shRNA control, mTP53
(shRNA-1), 5’-GTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAA-3’; mTP53 (shRNA-2), 5’-GAGG-
GATGTTTGGGAGATGTA-3’. The transfection of shRNAs into A549 cells was
facilitated through lentivirus. Subsequent selection of stable clones was
carried out using 0.2 µg/ml puromycin within a 48-h window, followed by
sustained maintenance for
subsequent experimental analyses. The
efﬁciency of knockdown in these cells was subsequently evaluated
through quantitative western blot analysis.

TP53 overexpression
Lentivirus containing either wild-type TP53 or harboring different hotspot
mutations,
including R248W, R175H, and R273H, cloned into the
PLAS2w.Pneo lentiviral transfer vector, was used to transfect H1299 cells,
which are p53 null. Overexpression of the TP53 wild-type or mutated
proteins is driven by a CMV promoter. After infection with lentivirus
containing these plasmids (MOI = 2), stable colonies were selected with
the antibiotic G418 (800 µg/ml) within 10 days and conﬁrmed using a
luciferase assay and western blot.

Cell viability assay
Quantiﬁcation of cell viability was executed through Sulforhodamine B
(SRB) assays. A549 and H1299 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with cell
growth medium, allowing a 16-hour incubation at a density of 3000 cells/
well. Subsequently, cells were exposed to varying doses of gemcitabine for
durations of 48 and 72 h. Post-drug exposure, cell monolayers were ﬁxed
using 10% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 24 h, followed by rinsing
with ddH2O. The monolayers were then stained with a 0.1% (wt/vol) SRB
solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for an hour and subsequently washed
thrice with a 1% (vol/vol) acetic acid solution. The dye, binding to proteins,
was dissolved in a 10 mM Tris base solution, allowing optical density (OD)
measurements at 540 nm via a microplate reader. The cell survival ratio
was calculated as Mean ODtreat/Mean ODcontrol.

Colony formation assay
Cell survival was assessed via a colony formation assay involving different
gemcitabine doses administered for 24 h. Following this, cells were
cultivated for several days depending on different experiments, after
which they were subjected to washing, ﬁxation, and staining using Crystal
Violet (Sigma). Capturing of colonies was facilitated by an Olympus IX-83
microscope, with triplicate samples taken for each experiment. Colonies
were counted if they contained a minimum of 50 cells per colony.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were initially ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde for a duration of 10 min,
followed by subsequent ﬁxation in 70% ethanol over an overnight period.
Following ﬁxation, the cells underwent staining with propidium iodide (PI)
and antibodies after a 30-minute incubation with 5 µg/ml RNase A. The
Cytoﬂex XL ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) was employed for cell
analysis, and the Cytoplex program was employed to quantify the cell
cycle phases.

Western blot analysis
In total, 3 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes and incubated at 37 °C
with 5% CO2 overnight. Post-drug treatment, ﬂoating cells were collected
via centrifugation, washed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then
scraped to obtain the cell pellet. Lysis of cells and subsequent
centrifugation were performed to obtain the supernatant. The protein
concentration was determined via a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). A
total of 30 µg of protein was denatured by heating at 99.9 °C for 10 min.
Next, 20 µL/well (comprising 30 µg of protein + lysis buffer + 4× dye) was
loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

Electro-transfer of proteins onto a 0.45-µm PVDF membrane (Millipore,
IPVH00010) was executed. Subsequently, membrane

dissolved in TBST) for one hour at room temperature. This was following by
an overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies (as detailed in
Supplement Table 1). Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse from
Jackson Lab) were utilized at dilutions of 1:5000 or 1:3000, followed by a
1-h incubation at room temperature. Detection was accomplished via
strong or weak enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and resultant images
were captured using the Luminescence Imaging system (Fuji LAS-4000).
Uncrop western blot images are included in Fig. S5.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Following two washes with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), cells underwent
ﬁxation using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. The cells were then
washed twice with TBS. Permeabilization was performed for 5 min
exposure to ice-cold 0.5% Triton X100, followed by 20 min incubation in
3% BSA diluted in 1× TBS.

The immunolabeling procedure commenced with the addition of
primary antibodies (γ-H2AX antibody at 1:300, α-tubulin at 1:300, or
pericentrin at 1:300, as detailed in Supplement Table 1) overnight with
50 rpm shaking. Subsequent to the removal of the staining solution, TBS
was used for cell washing. Introduction of a secondary antibody (Alexa
Fluor 568 anti-rabbit antibody or Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody) at a
1:300 concentration was carried out, allowing a 45 min incubation while
safeguarding samples from light. Post-secondary antibody incubation, the
stain solution was removed, and cells were rinsed with PBS.

A counterstain for cellular nuclei was executed through the addition of
DAPI stain solution at a concentration of 1:2000, all within 5 min, with light
protection measures in place. Following a ﬁnal PBS wash, mounting liquid
was utilized to secure coverslips onto slides. Imaging was accomplished via
a confocal LS700 microscope at a ×63 magniﬁcation or an Olympus BX61
upright ﬂuorescence microscope system at a ×40 magniﬁcation. All images
were subsequently analyzed using ImageJ software.

Connectivity Map/CLUE analysis
The Connectivity Map (CMap) platform (https://clue.io/) is a computational
tool that uncovers connections between drugs, genes, and diseases by
analyzing cellular responses [48]. Differentially expressed genes represent-
ing a speciﬁc biological state, particularly gemcitabine treatment, were
used to query the database. The platform then compared the query to its
signatures and generated a rank-ordered list based on similarity.
Connectivity scores were calculated using three metrics: (1) a nominal
p-value from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov enrichment statistic, (2) a false
discovery rate (FDR) for multiple hypothesis correction, and (3) Tau (τ) to
contextualize enrichment scores within the database. This analysis
identiﬁed Perturbational Classes (PCLs) and knockdown (KD) proﬁles
resembling gemcitabine’s
treatment effects, providing mechanistic
insights and therapeutic potential.

Enrichment analysis for transcriptomic proﬁle of lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients
Transcriptomic proﬁle of LUAD patients, normalized by Transcripts Per
Million (TPM) were retrieved from TCGA dataset via TCGAbiolinks package.
The patients were then divided into two groups, with and without TP53
mutations, for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

GSEA computed an enrichment score for each gene set and normalized
it based on the set’s size. The enrichment scores can be positive or
is up or downregulated,
negative indicating whether
respectively. This study employed the C2 gene set collection from the
MSigDB database for the analysis. GSEA was performed using 1000
permutations with a phenotype permutation type.

Clinical sample collection, DNA sequencing, and data
processing
To corroborate our ﬁndings through clinical response validation, we
collected specimens from advanced NSCLC patients who had undergone
gemcitabine treatment at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2015
and 2018. Tumor specimens were acquired during surgical procedures and
subsequently ﬁxed using formalin, following established protocols.

For each tumor sample, a single roll of ten-micrometer FFPE sections
was utilized for the extraction of genomic DNA and subsequent library
preparation. Library preparation procedures were conducted employing
the QIAseq Human Comprehensive 275 Cancer Panel
(DHS-3501Z,
QIAGEN), adhering to the manufacturer’s provided instructions. In essence,

each sample involved 50 ng of genomic DNA, which underwent initial
fragmentation,
followed by end-repair and A-tailing. Prepared DNA
fragments were subsequently ligated at their 5’ ends with sequencing-
speciﬁc adapters integrating UMIs (Unique Molecular Index) and sample
indexes.

the DNA library
templates were evaluated for quality utilizing the Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100. Upon conﬁrming library quality, qualiﬁed libraries underwent
sequencing through the NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) with the high
Output Kit V2 (300 cycles), adhering to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

target enrichment and library ampliﬁcation,

The interpretation of variants within the sequencing data was executed
by the GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center (QIAGEN) [49], Subsequent data
processing steps encompassed the exclusion of
single nucleotide
polymorphism sites and the application of variant mutation frequency
ﬁlters. Speciﬁcally, for TP53 alterations, TP53 hotspot mutations included
R175, G245, R248, R249, R273, and R282. Given TP53’s role as a
transcription activator, these mutations were categorized based on their
impact on the transcriptional activity across eight distinct promoters. This
classiﬁcation was guided by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) dataset, which aggregates a range of data and information
concerning cancer-related TP53 alterations [17].

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Discrepancies
between the experimental and control groups were assessed using a two-
tailed Student’s t test. Fisher’s exact test was employed to analyze
categorical variables. Calculation of progression-free survival and overall
survival was conducted through the Kaplan–Meier method. Signiﬁcance
levels were indicated as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and
****P < 0.0001.
