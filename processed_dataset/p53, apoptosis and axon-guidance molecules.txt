Abstract
The p53 tumor-suppressor gene regulates apoptosis through
the transcriptional activation of
its target genes. The
the axon-guidance molecule UNC5B (also
expression of
designated p53RDL1), which is a receptor for netrin-1,
is
directly regulated by p53. In the absence of netrin-1, UNC5B
mediates p53-dependent apoptosis. Conversely,
in the
presence of netrin-1, p53-induced apoptosis is inhibited
through the signaling pathway activated by the interaction
between netrin-1 and UNC5B. A number of other molecules
that are involved in axon guidance are inactivated in human
cancers and are also regulated by p53. These ﬁndings
suggest a close link between axon-guidance molecules and
tumorigenesis.

Introduction

p53, mutated in over 50% of all human cancers, may be
considered to be the most important tumor-suppressor gene.
p53 encodes a transcription factor that exerts its physiological
functions by binding to a speciﬁc sequence within its target
gene and activating its transcription.1,2 So far, a number of
p53-target genes have been identiﬁed, which have a wide
variety of effects in the cell.2,3 Thus, p53 is likely to regulate a
variety of functions in response to different cellular stresses.
Modiﬁcations of the p53 protein have been implicated in this
regulation.2,3 In particular, the Ser46 phosphorylation of p53 is

thought to play an important role in the activation of p53-
dependent apoptosis.4

Although various activities are regulated by p53, p53-
regulated apoptosis is believed to be the most important for
tumor suppression.5 A number of excellent studies have
attempted to understand the mechanism of p53-dependent
apoptosis. These reports have suggested that the mitochon-
drial and the death-receptor apoptotic pathways play a
key role in the process.5 However,
identiﬁcation of a
number of p53-regulated genes clearly indicated that there
are many p53-regulated apoptotic genes that are not
involved in these two major pathways,
the
mechanism for p53-dependent apoptosis still remains to be
fully elucidated.

implying that

In the developing nervous system, migrating cells and axons
are guided to their targets by chemotaxis. Members of four
protein families (netrins, semaphorins, ephrins and slits) are
involved in this process.6 Netrins, slits and some semaphorins
are secreted molecules, whereas ephrins and other semaphor-
ins are expressed at the cell surface. Several transmembrane
receptors have been identiﬁed for each of these cues, including
deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), neogenin and UNC5H
(rodent and human UNC5H receptor) for netrins; roundabout
(ROBO) receptors for slit proteins; neuropilin and plexin for
semaphorins; and Eph receptors for ephrins. These molecules
involved in the four pathways have important roles in neural
development and differentiation.

The concept of ‘dependence receptors’ was recently pro-
posed by Bredesen et al.7 and Mehlen and Bredesen.8 DCC is
a receptor for netrin-1 that has been shown to regulate apop-
tosis as a dependence receptor.9 In the absence of netrin-1,
DCC induces apoptosis, whereas DCC-induced apoptosis is
blocked in the presence of netrin-1. Thus, DCC might be a
conditional tumor suppressor that is dependent on netrin-1.
Similarly, UNC5H has also been shown to act as a dependence
receptor that regulates apoptosis.10 Surprisingly, one of the
UNC5H molecules was directly regulated by the tumor sup-
pressor p53.11 In addition, its ligand, netrin-1, was also a direct
target for p53. These ﬁndings have provided a new perspective
on the role of the p53-regulatory system in apoptosis.

Tumor Suppressor p53 and Apoptosis

Since its discovery, p53 has been a central player in the
cancer research ﬁeld, and much attention has been paid to
this molecule by oncologists because it is frequently mutated
in human cancers. Crucially, p53 encodes a transcription
factor that binds to the speciﬁc sequences of its target genes
and activates their transcription. p53 therefore exerts its
physiological functions through the transcriptional activation
of target genes. So far, a number of p53-target genes have
been reported including p21/WAF1,12 Bax,13 IGF-BP3,14
BAI1,15 GADD45,16 p53R217 and MDM2.18 The products of
these genes have diverse functions including cell-cycle arrest,

transcription, nucleotide metabolism and
ubiquitin ligase activity. Although cell-cycle arrest and DNA
repair are likely to be key functions in tumor suppression,
apoptosis is believed to play a vital role in preventing cells
transformation by eliminating
from undergoing malignant
damaged cells.5 Several excellent studies have attempted
to clarify the mechanism of p53-dependent apoptosis, and a
number of p53-target genes have been identiﬁed that have
relevant roles. Currently, two pathways are known to function
in p53-regulated apoptosis (Figure 1).5 The ﬁrst
is the
mitochondrial pathway, which involves many p53-target
genes including Bax,13 p53AIP1,4 Noxa,19 Puma,20,21
APAF-1,22 PIG3,23 POX,24 ALDH4,25 FDXR26 and CABC1.27
Recently, a direct role for p53 in this pathway was inferred
from its localization within mitochondria (Figure 1).28 The
second is the death-receptor pathway, in which Fas29 and
Killer/DR530 have been identiﬁed as the p53-target genes that
mediate this pathway. Several additional target genes that are
not directly involved in these pathways have also been shown
to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis.

Why does p53 regulate multiple apoptotic genes as its
transcriptional targets? A recent study has provided a clue to
this question.31 This study examined how

tissue speciﬁcity with distinct regulation of p53-inducible
genes in different cells and tissue compartments. For
example, p53-dependent induction of Puma occurred in the
splenic white pulp, whereas Noxa was induced in the red pulp.
Thus, p53 appears to regulate distinct targets in different
tissues or cells. This indicates that there might be tissue- or
functions or
cell-speciﬁc regulation of
pathways by p53. This ﬁnding clearly suggests that p53 might
regulate its target genes in a tissue- or cell-speciﬁc manner,
and must therefore regulate a number of different apoptotic-
target genes.

Recently, UNC5B was reported to be a direct target gene for
p53 that mediates p53-dependent apoptosis.11 UNC5B is also
known to be a dependence receptor that regulates apoptosis
either positively or negatively depending on its interaction with
netrin-1.10 UNC5B-induced apoptosis seems to be indepen-
dent of the mitochondrial and death-receptor pathways. This
might therefore represent a third pathway for p53-dependent
apoptosis (Figure 1). The present review focuses on this p53-
regulated dependence-receptor pathway and discusses
the close link between axon-guidance molecules and
tumorigenesis.

p53-regulated apoptotic pathways. p53 is activated in response to various cellular stresses. Initially, kinases (such as ATM,83,84 CHK285 and CKII86) sense

the stresses, and then phosphorylate the p53 protein at various sites (such as Ser15, Ser20 and Ser46) through interactions with cofactors (such as p53DINP1,87 JMY88
and ASPP89). These upstream molecules modify the p53 protein, leading to the activation of p53. The activated p53 binds to speciﬁc sequences in apoptotic-target
genes and activates their transcription. Several p53-regulated apoptotic-target genes have been identiﬁed and are divided into two major pathways: the mitochondrial
and death-receptor pathways. Bax, Noxa, Puma, p53AIP1, PIG3, POX, ALDH4, FDXR, CABC1 and APAF-1 belong to the former group, and Killer/DR5 and Fas belong
to the latter. UNC5B was recently found to be involved in p53-regulated apoptotic pathways, implying the involvement of dependence receptors in a third pathway.
UNC5A, NTN1 (encoding netrin-1), NEO1 (encoding neogenin) and RGMA (encoding RGM) might be involved in this pathway. Furthermore, a transcription-independent
p53-regulated apoptotic pathway was identiﬁed, in which p53 itself localizes to mitochondria and directly regulates the mitochondrial antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL

Cell Death and Differentiation

p53 and UNC5B

UNC5B is one of four related receptors for netrin-1 (UNC5A,
UNC5B, UNC5C and UNC5D), all of which are type-I
transmembrane proteins that belong to the Unc5 family.32
Rodent UNC5H1, UNC5H2 and UNC5H3 were designated by
sequence homology to be orthologs of Caenorhabditis
elegans UNC5, which has a role in axon guidance along with
the ortholog of netrin-1, uncoordinated 6 (UNC6).33 Rodent
UNC5H1, UNC5H2 and UNC5H3 are orthologs of human
UNC5A, UNC5B and UNC5C, respectively. Hereafter, the
term UNC5H is used to refer to UNC5H1, UNC5H2, UNC5H3,
UNC5A, UNC5B and UNC5C. All of these proteins have two
immunoglobulin-like domains and two thrombospondin-like
repeats in the extracellular region, along with a zonula
occludens 1 (ZO-1) domain and a death domain in the
intracellular region.10,32 Recently, the sequences of human
UNC5D and rodent UNC5H4 were obtained and deposited in
the database (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank). However, so far,
nothing is known about the function of these molecules.

UNC5B contains a death domain in its intracellular region
and acts as a dependence receptor.10 This protein’s
intracellular region also contains a classical caspase-clea-
vage sequence, DXXD. As has been demonstrated for rodent
UNC5H2,10 UNC5B is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro (N
Kitamura and H Arakawa, unpublished data), and a point
mutation at
the cleavage site inhibits UNC5B-induced
apoptosis in vivo.11 The deletion of the death domain of
UNC5H2, which is the rodent ortholog of human UNC5B,
completely abrogates UNC5H2-induced apoptosis, implying
that the death domain is essential for this process.10 The

largely
mechanism of UNC5B-induced apoptosis is still
unknown. However, two proteins are thought to be involved
in the signaling pathway. The ﬁrst is the death-associated
protein kinase (DAPK), which might mediate UNC5H2-
induced apoptosis by interacting with the death domain of
UNC5H2.34 The second is the neurotrophin receptor-inter-
acting melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) homolog
(NRAGE), which is known to interact with UNC5H1.35 NRAGE
has also been suggested to mediate UNC5H-induced
apoptosis.

It has recently been shown that the transcription of UNC5B
is directly regulated by p53.11 A p53-binding sequence is
located within intron 1 of the UNC5B gene. In response to
genotoxic stresses, UNC5B expression was induced in
line
a p53-dependent manner in the colorectal cancer cell
HCT116-p53 þ / þ and the breast cancer cell
line MCF7
(both of which contain wild-type (wt) p53), but not in the

cleaved at the intracellular region, releasing the peptide containing the death domain. This peptide might interact with DAPK and NRAGE, resulting in the activation of
caspase-3 and apoptosis induction. This pathway is likely to be independent of the mitochondrial and death-receptor apoptotic pathways. Conversely, in the presence of
netrin-1, binding to UNC5B induces its homodimerization, thus blocking the caspase cleavage. In addition, UNC5B sends a survival signal either directly, or through the
activation of PI3K and AKT, in order to block p53-dependent apoptosis

p53 and Netrin-1

Netrins were initially identiﬁed through the genetic analysis of
nematodes with mutations in the UNC6 gene. These animals
exhibit defects in the guidance of commissural and motor
axons.36,37 Netrin-1 is the vertebrate homolog of UNC6,
implying that it functions as a chemotrophic molecule that
mediates axon outgrowth and orientation or neuronal migra-
tion during neuronal development.38–41 It is encoded by the
NTN1 gene and is a laminin-related, secreted protein, which
has an amino (N)-terminal type IV laminin repeat (domain IV),
followed by three cysteine-rich epidermal growth-factor
modules (domains V1, V2 and V3), and a positively charged
carboxy-terminal domain.38

Another interesting observation was made in the p53-
regulated UNC5B signaling pathway. In the absence of netrin-
1,
infection with adenovirus containing the UNC5B gene
induced remarkable levels of apoptosis in a glioblastoma cell
line (U373MG) containing mutant p53, but was unable to
induce apoptosis in the presence of netrin-1.11 This ﬁnding is
consistent with the notion that UNC5B is a dependence
receptor. Surprisingly, the addition of GST-fused netrin-1 to
the culture medium strongly inhibited p53-induced apoptosis
in vitro. Under conditions in which netrin-1 actively signaled,
p53 was stably expressed and accumulated, but was
functionally inactivated.11 Moreover, the induction of p21/
WAF1 and Bax was severely impaired under these conditions,
implying dysfunction of the trans-activating activity of p53.11
This suggests that the netrin–UNC5B signaling inactivates
p53 post-translationally.

How does netrin–UNC5B signaling block p53-induced
apoptosis? It is likely that the suppression of p53-induced
apoptosis cannot be explained solely in terms of
the
inhibition of UNC5B-induced apoptosis by netrin-1. This is
because, as noted above, p53 regulates multiple apoptotic
including the mitochondrial and death-receptor
pathways,
pathways. Although the mechanism is largely unknown,
several clues have been provided by the ﬁndings for
DCC, which is a dependence receptor and a receptor
for netrin-1. The process might involve two steps: blocking
the caspase-dependent cleavage of the intracellular region of
the receptors and sending the antiapoptotic signal. In the
ﬁrst step, when netrin-1 binds to DCC and/or UNC5H,
the receptors might interact with one another.42 In the case
identiﬁed dependence
of p75/NTR, which was the ﬁrst
receptor, its dimerization is required to block the proapoptotic
effect.43 Thus, in the cases of DCC and the Unc5 family,
the binding of netrin-1 might induce homo- or heterodimeriza-
tion,
resulting in structural changes in the intracellular
region, which in turn might block caspase cleavage. In the
second step, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT
pathway might be of importance. In the case of DCC, DIP13-a/
APPL mediates DCC-induced apoptosis by interacting
with its intracellular domain.44 However, DIP13-a/APPL has

also been shown to interact with AKT2, and to act as an
adaptor protein between the p110-a catalytic subunit of
PI3K and AKT2,
thus implying a role in facilitating the
activation of AKT2.45 AKT has a well-established role in
antiapoptotic signaling pathways.46,47 When netrin-1 interacts
with DCC, DIP13-a/APPL dissociates and might subsequently
activate AKT2 by interacting with AKT2 and PI3K, as an

Based on the existing evidence, netrin-1 might act as an
oncogene under certain circumstances. If the expression of
netrin-1 is elevated in human cancers, the p53-dependent
apoptotic pathway will be inactivated through netrin-1 signal-
ing. Recent data support this hypothesis. NTN1-transgenic
mice were generated and analyzed in order to evaluate the in
vivo role of netrin-1 in regulating apoptosis and tumorigen-
esis.50 In these mice, overexpression of netrin-1 in the colon,
where DCC and UNC5H2 are consistently expressed
throughout the intestinal epithelium, reduced apoptosis in
intestinal epithelial cells,
leading to an increase in the
spontaneous formation of colonic hyperplasia and adenoma.
Moreover, NTN1-transgenic mice, on a genetic background
from which the adenomatous polyposis coli gene had been
knocked out, showed an increased rate of development of
high-grade adenoma with focal adenocarcinoma.50 Thus, the
role of netrin-1 as an oncogene might be crucial during the
early stages of the adenoma–carcinoma sequence of color-
ectal cancers.

Is netrin-1 overexpressed in human colorectal cancers?
Only two previous papers have reported the expression of
netrin-1 in human cancers including brain tumors, neuroblas-
tomas and prostate cancers.51,52 These studies showed,
surprisingly,
that netrin-1 was downregulated in these
cancers. However, this unexpected observation could be

netrin-1 expression was elevated in three out of 40 primary
colorectal cancers in which DCC was also expressed,
thus implying that
the netrin-1 and DCC pathway was
intact in these three cases.50 Further investigation will be

Life or Death: Another Pathway for the p53
Switch

As noted above, if netrin-1 blocks p53-dependent apoptosis,
this raises an important question: why does p53 activate the
transcription of UNC5B? In the presence of netrin-1, the
induction of UNC5B by p53 leads to cell survival, whereas in
the absence of netrin-1, the induction of UNC5B by p53 leads
to cell death. Given that p53 is crucial for the death or survival
of cells in response to cellular stresses, the regulation of
UNC5B alone as a receptor for netrin-1 does not appear
compatible with the essential role of p53. An important
observation concerning this issue is that the expression of
netrin-1 is also directly regulated by p53 (N Kitamura, H
Nakanishi, C Tanikawa, Y Nakamura and H Arakawa,
unpublished data). Thus, p53 might determine cell fate by
regulating both netrin-1 and its receptor, UNC5B (Figure 3).
For example, in order to activate the death pathway, p53
induces UNC5B but not netrin-1. By contrast, in order to
activate the survival pathway, p53 induces both UNC5B and
netrin-1. Why would a cell have evolved this form of dual
control?

The death signal induced by p53 is well established and has
been investigated in a number of excellent studies.5 By
contrast, the survival signal induced by p53 has not yet been
studied. Why does p53 send a survival signal? The reason is
still unclear. However, if we consider p53 to be a pivotal
checkpoint protein, which determines cell fate after various
cellular stresses, it is likely to be required both for inducing

death and for prolonging cell survival. Moreover, if we see
p53’s primary role as protecting cells from stress, it might
allow the damaged cells to live by sending a strong survival
signal, and triggering their repair by inducing the transcription
of various repair-related genes. Consistent with this idea, p53
is known to activate the transcription of many cell survival-
related genes including p53R2,17,53 XPC,54 DDB2,55 CSR56
and ALDH4.25 Strong survival signals are well known to be
delivered to cells by soluble ligands binding to cell-surface
receptors, for example, by growth factors and their receptors,
or by direct
the
extracellular matrix, which activate the PI3K–AKT pathway.57
By delivering strong survival signals through the PI3K–AKT
pathway, p53 could downregulate all three p53-dependent
pathways leading to apoptosis through the transcriptional
induction of netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B, and so protect
cells from cellular stresses. Moreover,
the transcriptional
activation of netrin-1 by p53 could send a survival signal not
itself but also for surrounding cells, by
only for the cell
providing a soluble molecule that could act as a paracrine
signal, and result in the survival and protection of a group of
cells under stress.

interactions with neighboring cells or

Although the details of the mechanism remain unclear, it is
possible that activating the PI3K–AKT pathway through the
transcriptional induction of netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B is
the most powerful way to block cell-death signaling and
ensure cell survival.48,49,57 In support of this theory, a number
of somatic oncogenic mutations of the PIK3CA gene, which
encodes the p110-a catalytic subunit, have recently been

Figure 3 A new pathway for the p53 life or death switch. p53 might determine cell fate through the transcriptional regulation of netrin-1 and UNC5B under physiological
conditions. In order to eliminate a cell with DNA damage, p53 activates the transcription of UNC5B. The protein is then expressed and localized at the cell membrane,
leading to the cleavage of the intracellular domain and apoptosis induction. Conversely, in order for the cell to survive, p53 activates the transcription of both netrin-1 and
UNC5B. Netrin-1 is expressed and secreted, and binds to UNC5B, thereby sending the survival signal. This signal blocks p53-dependent apoptosis. An unknown
protease or caspase might be induced by p53 to trigger UNC5B-induced apoptosis by cleaving the intracellular domain of UNC5B. In this model, the expression of
UNC5B alone at the cell membrane does not always induce apoptosis

reported in human cancers,58 suggesting that activation of the
PI3K pathway might block p53-dependent apoptosis. Further
investigation of this potential control mechanism for UNC5B
and netrin-1 by p53 will be necessary before a conclusive
mechanism can be determined.

Other Axon-Guidance-Related Molecules:
Alteration in Human Cancer and
p53-Dependent Regulation

Interestingly, several axon-guidance-related genes, NTN1,
DCC, UNC5H, SEMA3B, SEMA3F, SLIT2, ROBO1 and
EPHB2, are genetically and epigenetically inactivated in a
number of human cancers, implying that all four pathways
involved in axon guidance are downregulated during the
tumorigenic process.59 In addition to netrin-1 and UNC5B,
SEMA3B and EPHA2 were previously reported to be p53-
inducible genes.60,61 Moreover, UNC5A, SEMA3F, SLIT2 and
EPHB2 are p53 inducible under certain conditions (M
Futamura, H Kamino and H Arakawa, unpublished data).59
This implies that all four pathways are regulated by tumor
suppressor p53.

SEMA3B and SEMA3F were originally identiﬁed as
candidate tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome 3p21.3,
in a region that undergoes allelic loss in B80% of primary lung
lung
cancer and homozygous deletions in several small
cancer cell lines.62 The sequences of these genes indicated
that the proteins they encoded were two additional members
of the human semaphorin family, semaphorin 3B and 3F,
belonging to class 3 semaphorins, whose receptors are the
neuropilins. Following this report, SEMA3B was observed to
be hypermethylated in lung cancers, and several point
mutations were identiﬁed along with loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) in the region.63 Moreover, the enforced expression of
SEMA3B in lung cancers normally lacking semaphorin 3B
expression induced growth suppression and apoptosis.64,65
Semaphorin 3F was also shown to suppress tumor formation
in nude mice; this effect was thought to be due to the inhibition
of tumor angiogenesis,66–69 as a result of semaphorin 3F
binding to and activating its receptor, neurophilin-2, which
then inhibits the VEGF- and bFGF-induced proliferation of
vascular endothelial cells.

The SLIT–ROBO interaction mediates the repulsive cues
on axons and growth cones during neural development and is
also thought to be involved in the cell migration of myoblasts
and leukocytes. SLIT2 is frequently inactivated by LOH and
hypermethylation in colorectal cancers, and the introduction of
SLIT2 suppresses tumor growth.70,71 ROBO1, which is a
receptor for SLIT2, is also thought to be a candidate tumor-
suppressor gene at chromosome 3p12. ROBO1 is frequently
inactivated in lung, kidney and breast cancers by LOH and
hypermethylation.72,73 Moreover, exon 2 of ROBO1/DUTT1
was found to be homozygously deleted in two lung cancer cell
lines and one breast cancer cell line.74 Ectopic expression of
SLIT2 was suggested to induce the growth suppression of
several cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis.70,71 However,
the mechanism by which the SLIT–ROBO signaling sup-
presses tumor growth remains largely unclear.

Cell Death and Differentiation

The EPHB2 gene encodes the ephrin receptor EPHB2
and was originally isolated from a cDNA expression library
as a kinase overexpressed in human cancers.75 Ephrin and
EPH receptor signaling is involved at various stages of the
neuronal developmental, including axon-guidance and neur-
al-crest migration, vascular modeling and cell positioning in
the intestinal epithelium. Recently,
frameshift, splice site,
missense and nonsense mutations of EPHB2 have been
found in human prostate cancers.76 Moreover, overexpres-
sion of wt EPHB2, but not mutant EPHB2, suppressed the
clonogenic growth of a prostate cancer cell line, DU145, with
biallelic inactivation (nonsense mutations and loss of the wt
allele) of EPHB2. Interestingly, EPHB2 maps to chromosome
1p36.1, where deletions are observed frequently in many
cancers, including neuroblastomas. Although the mechanism
for tumor suppression through Ephrin and EPH receptor
signaling remains to be elucidated,
these data strongly
support a possible role of EPHB2 as a tumor-suppressor
gene.

The roles of semaphorins, slits, ephrins and their receptors
in tumorigenesis have been well characterized and previously
reviewed, with respect
to cell migration during cancer
metastasis and angiogenesis during the neovasculization
promoted by oncogenes.77–82 However, as noted above,
recent studies have clearly demonstrated their roles as tumor-
suppressor genes. The mechanism for tumor suppression by
semaphorins, slits, ephrins and their receptors is largely
unknown and, together with apoptosis, remains a matter for
future investigation. The observed inactivation in cancer and
the p53-dependent regulation strongly suggest that important
common mechanisms are involved in both axon guidance and
tumorigenesis.59

Conclusions and Future Directions

We have demonstrated that both UNC5B and netrin-1
are directly regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, and
provide a new mechanism for p53’s switch between cell
death or cell survival. The signaling pathways for UNC5B-
induced apoptosis and netrin-1-dependent antiapoptosis are
the cleavage of UNC5B by
largely unknown. However,
caspase or another unidentiﬁed protease seems to be
indispensable for UNC5B-induced apoptosis, and two
possible proteins, DAPK and NRAGE, might mediate
this pathway. By
the PI3K–AKT pathway
might be involved in signaling in netrin-1-regulated
antiapoptosis.

contrast,

Important questions still remain to be addressed. If UNC5B
requires caspase cleavage to induce apoptosis, how is a
caspase or other protease activated before the cleavage of
UNC5B? What is the initiator of UNC5B-induced apoptosis?
One possibility is that another trigger is needed to activate an
unknown protease or caspase. Even in the absence of netrin-
1, the expression of UNC5B alone at the cellular membrane
does not always induce apoptosis. Another trigger might
respond to various cellular stresses, leading to the recruitment
and activation of an unknown protease or caspase (Figure 3).
One attractive candidate for a trigger is p53. In fact, we
observed that caspase-1, which is one of the p53-target

p53-regulated expression of various axon-guidance molecules. p53 regulates transcription of the netrin and RGM (NTN1 and RGMA) and their receptors
(UNC5A, UNC5B and NEO1), the semaphorins (SEMA3B and SEMA3F) and their receptor neuropilin-2 (NRP2), the slits (SLIT1, SLIT2 and SLIT3), and the ephrins
(EFNB1 and EFNB3) and their receptors (EPHB1, EPHB2 and EPHB3). This suggests that p53 has a role in all four of the pathways that are involved in axon guidance.
In response to various cellular stresses, p53 might alter its structure by a combination of protein modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation,
sumoylation, ubiquitination and glycosylation. Each p53 conﬁguration might correspond to the sequence of a group of target genes, thereby regulating a number of axon-
guidance molecules. Netrins and their receptors are involved in p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas the functions of other molecules in p53-regulated tumor suppression
remain largely unknown

genes, caused the cleavage of wt-UNC5B but not mt-UNC5B
(D412N), at the caspase-cleavage site (Asp412; N Kitamura
and H Arakawa, unpublished data). p53 might trigger UNC5B-
induced apoptosis through the transcriptional activation of
caspase-1 in vivo.

As noted, several axon-guidance molecules are inactivated
in human cancers and are p53 inducible under certain
conditions. In addition, we now realize that RGMA (encoding
RGM), NEO1 (encoding neogenin), NRP2 (encoding neuro-
philin-2), SLIT1, SLIT3, EFNB1, EFNB3, EPHB1 and EPHB3
are also p53 inducible, although these molecules have not yet
been shown to be altered in cancers (M Futamura, H Kamino
and H Arakawa, unpublished data; Figure 4). Thus, p53
regulates all four axon-guidance pathways: netrins, sema-
phorins, SLITs and ephrins. This review has shown that netrin
is likely to be involved in apoptosis regulation, with its
receptors acting as dependence receptors. However, the
mechanisms for tumor suppression by the other pathways are
largely unknown. What are the functions of semaphorins,
SLITs and ephrins as p53-regulated genes? Are these
molecules involved in p53-regulated tumor suppression?
Further investigation of these molecules will be necessary
to understand the roles of
these important pathways in
tumorigenesis.59
