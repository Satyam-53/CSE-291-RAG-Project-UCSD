Abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been suggested as a surrogate biomarker for early
detection of cancer recurrence. We aimed to explore the utility of ctDNA as a noninvasive prog-
nostic biomarker in newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients.
Seventy HNSCC specimens were analysed for the detection of TP53 genetic alterations utilizing
next-generation sequencing (NGS). TP53 mutations were revealed in 55 (79%). Upon detection
of a signiﬁcant TP53 mutation, circulating cell-free DNA was scrutinized for the presence of the
tumor-speciﬁc mutation. ctDNA was identiﬁed at a minimal allele frequency of 0.08% in 21 out
of 30 processed plasma samples. Detectable ctDNA correlated with regional spread (N stage ≥ 1,
p = 0.011) and poorer 5-year progression-free survival (20%, 95% CI 10.9 to 28.9, p = 0.034). The
high-risk worst pattern of invasion (WPOI grade 4–5) and deep invasion were frequently found in
patients whose ctDNA was detected (p = 0.087 and p = 0.072, respectively). Detecting mutated TP53
ctDNA was associated with poor progression-free survival and regional metastases, indicating its
potential role as a prognostic biomarker. However, ctDNA detectability in early-stage disease and the
mechanisms modulating its release into the bloodstream must be further elucidated.

1. Introduction

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh leading cancer
worldwide, with approximately 600,000 new cases diagnosed each year [1]. It is com-
prised of a heterogenous group of tumors that arise from the mucosal lining of the upper
aerodigestive tract. In spite of their anatomical and etiological diversity, they are uniformly
aggressive, with high rates of progression and relapse despite multimodal therapies [2]. Pa-
tients who are diagnosed with advanced-stage HNSCC have an extremely poor prognosis,
with ﬁve-year survival rates ranging between 25–59% [3–5]. The past few decades have
witnessed advances in molecular and genetic proﬁling of cancer. These genomic interro-
gations have facilitated the emergence of clinically applicable molecular tools, currently
under investigation for diagnostic purposes, therapy planning, and disease surveillance in
various cancers.

One promising application is the sampling and analyzing of circulating tumor cells
and circulating tumor DNA fragments, that give rise to the concept of liquid biopsy [6].
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is comprised of short DNA fragments released
into the bloodstream by active secretion or spilled from senescent or apoptotic tumor
cells [7–9], harbors somatic genetic alternations of the tumor cells that are not present
in normal cells [10]. The potential utility of ctDNA as a tumor biomarker has thus far
been limited by the low concentration of the mutant cell-free DNA in the bloodstream,
sometimes constituting less than 0.01% of circulating DNA [11]. Implementation of new and
efﬁcacious sequencing technologies, such as digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and next-generation sequencing, has greatly improved ctDNA detection rates [8,12,13].
Several studies have explored the utility of ctDNA for early detection of cancer [14,15],
disease monitoring [16,17], evaluation of treatment resistance, and surveillance of residual
or recurrent disease [18,19]. ctDNA levels have also been shown to correlate with disease
burden and to reliably represent tumor dynamics in breast, colorectal, and pancreatic
cancer patients [8,16,17,20]. New evidence has suggested the potential value of ctDNA
as a biomarker for the monitoring of treatment or for the detection of residual disease
in HNSCC [21–24]. In the case of virally driven tumors (Epstein–Barr virus-associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma and human papilloma virus [HPV]-associated oropharyngeal
SCC), the easily detected viral ctDNA has emerged as an attractive blood-based molecular
diagnostic tool [25,26], but its integration into clinical practice is still hindered. It has
been only recently reported by Flach et al. [27] in the LIONESS study, which included
17 HPV-negative HNSCC patients, that ctDNA is feasible as a biomarker for detecting
disease recurrence before the appearance of any clinical signs.

In this study, we focused upon somatic alterations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.
Previous studies that evaluated the mutational landscape of HNSCC had revealed TP53 as
being a major driver of HNSCC [28–30]. The Cancer Genome Atlas reported near-universal
TP53 loss of function mutations in HPV-negative HNSCC, making TP53 the most frequently
mutated gene in HNSCC [28]. The presence of TP53 mutations was also shown to correlate
with treatment response and survival, indicating the potential value of TP53 analysis for
predicting clinical outcomes [29].

We speculated that targeted sequencing of TP53 can detect the speciﬁc mutational
signatures of most HNSCC tumors. We designed this study to evaluate whether detectable
tumor-speciﬁc TP53 alteration in the circulating cell-free DNA in plasma samples obtained
immediately before curative-intent surgery could provide an integrative noninvasive molec-
ular biomarker for risk level stratiﬁcation. Ultimately, we aimed to assess the prognostic
value and the potential translational applicability of ctDNA as a surrogate marker for
high-risk disease in newly diagnosed resectable HNSCC.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population

Approval for this retrospective registry study was granted by the Institutional Review
Board at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, and informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The study period extended from 2014 to 2022. Patients diagnosed with
HNSCC were recruited if the samples taken from the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx had
been histologically conﬁrmed as SCC, and if surgical resection planned for curative intent
was to take place before the initiation of any oncologic treatment. We excluded patients
under 18 years of age, those unable to provide informed consent and patients with distant
metastases or other active malignant disease at the time of diagnosis. Cases were also
selected from the MIDGAM-Israel National Biobank for Research if plasma samples were
available at the time of tumor resection.

2.2. Clinical and Histopathological Data and Outcome Measures

Medical records were reviewed and data on demographics, smoking habits, disease
characteristics and stage, histopathological ﬁndings, and adjuvant therapy were collected

Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1418

and recorded. All tumor specimens underwent a comprehensive histologic assessment
by an expert head and neck pathologist. That analysis included documentation of depth
of invasion (DOI), perineural or lymphovascular invasion, microscopic measurements
of surgical margins, extra-capsular extension, and worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) as
described in details elsewhere [31,32]. Brieﬂy, the pattern of invasion Type 1 consisted of
tumor invasion in a broad pushing manner, Type 2 represents tumor invading in “ﬁnger-
like” fashion, and Type 3 demonstrates invasive islands of tumor with >15 cell clusters.
Invasive tumor islands smaller than 15 cells per island or strands of tumor cells in a single-
cell ﬁlling pattern regardless of island size were graded Type 4, and the detection of tumor
satellites of any size with a 1 mm or greater distance from tumor/host interface was graded
Type 5.

In general, patients were considered for adjuvant radiotherapy if the tumor invasion
was deep (≥10 mm), or when metastatic lymph nodes were present. In certain cases,
Pathological ﬁndings, such as perineural invasion and poor histologic differentiation, in
certain cases, were also indications for adjuvant radiotherapy. Unless the patient was medi-
cally unﬁt for chemotherapy, concurrent postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy
were administered in cases of microscopically involved surgical margins and in cases of
extracapsular extension, regardless of the total number of excised metastatic lymph nodes.
The latter approach was adopted in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guidelines [33]) and based upon the ﬁndings of the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer [34] and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [35] trials.
The primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) considering all-cause
mortality and progression-free survival (PFS). Recurrence was deﬁned as the ﬁrst evidence
of recurrent disease or the occurrence of disease-related death. Disease progression was
deﬁned when treatment failed, and disease was evident either clinically or radiologically at
the ﬁrst follow-up visit after deﬁnitive treatment.

2.3. Tumor DNA Extraction

The hematoxylin and eosin stained FFPE slides of tumor samples were reviewed
by a pathologist who identiﬁed and marked tumor areas. Serial 8 µm-thick sections of
the parafﬁnized specimen block were placed on slides, and the corresponding marked
areas of tumor were micro-dissected with a sterile scalpel. DNA extraction was performed
by means of the ReliaPrep FFPE gDNA Miniprep system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

2.4. TP53 Library Generation and Determining the Fraction of Mutated Copies

Next-generation sequencing was performed with the Ion Torrent Personal Genome
Machine (PGM) sequencer platform (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA
puriﬁed from the tumor specimens underwent PCR ampliﬁcation by the use of a panel that
covers the TP53 coding regions (supplementary Table S1). The panel was designed to work
in a multiplex reaction according to Biezuner et al. [36], after which the primer sequences
were tested with the Thermo Fisher multiple primer analyzer to reduce potential primer
dimers. The primer pairs were split into three multiplex mixes, and primers that showed
potential dimers or that ampliﬁed neighboring areas were assigned to different mixes.

An ampliﬁcation-based sequencing method was used to construct libraries for se-
quencing by means of a two-step PCR protocol. In the ﬁrst step, the genomic segments
were ampliﬁed with gene-speciﬁc primers. One primer in each pair was coupled to the
M13 sequence and the other to the P1 sequence (supplementary Table S1). In the second
step, barcodes and adapters were attached to allow their binding to Ion Torrent sphere
particles. We aimed for a coverage of at least 1000 reads to enable accurate determination of
the mutation fraction in each sample. Sequencing data were initially processed by the Ion
Torrent platform-speciﬁc pipeline software Torrent Suite (5.2.2). The variant caller results
were analyzed by the wAnnovar website [37] in order to identify the signiﬁcance of each

mutation. Mutations were deﬁned by their frequency being above 5% in the sequencing
result, and if alteration of the TP53 protein could be considered as being tumor-related.

2.5. Plasma Sample Collection and ctDNA Detection

Blood samples (8–10 mL) were collected in EDTA collection tubes by standard phle-
botomy techniques from recruited patients upon the induction of anesthesia prior to tumor
resection and processed within up to two hours for cryopreservation. Blood was cen-
trifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, and plasma fraction was separated
and stored at −80 ◦C.

Only patients whose tumor had at least one signiﬁcant TP53 mutation, altering protein
function with allele frequency above 5%, were included in the analysis of ctDNA. The
plasma samples of patients with detectable TP53 mutation, that had been collected and
handled at the time of tumor resection, were thawed and processed for circulating cell-
free DNA isolation according to the MagMax Cell Free DNA isolation kit protocol (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The extracted DNA was quantiﬁed by the Qubit DNA
high-sensitivity assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To detect patient-speciﬁc
TP53 mutation, primer pairs were designed to target a short amplicon (70–100 bp) around
mutated sequences (primer pairs are shown in supplementary Table S2). Each primer
pair was ﬁrst used to conﬁrm the detection of the mutation in the tumor DNA. Targeted
re-sequencing validated all detected mutations. After validation, PCR ampliﬁcation of the
mutated TP53 position was applied to the DNA extracted from the patient’s plasma, and
products were deeply sequenced by the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. Processing of each
sample was carried out in duplicates both on the patient’s cell-free DNA and on wild-type
DNA, to determine the level of noise at the speciﬁc position of the searched mutation. We
aimed for at least 10,000 reads from each sample for accurate determination of mutant
fractions in the ctDNA. Mutations were registered when the mutant allele frequency was
at least three times higher than noise in the wild-type allele and when each duplicate had
a coverage of at least 10 reads of the mutant allele. Mutations were considered negative
when they did not meet the above criteria and had a coverage of at least 5000 cumulative
reads from the duplicates.

2.6. Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27,
IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA, 2021). Categorical variables were described as frequencies.
Odds ratios were used to measure the effect size. The signiﬁcance and 95% conﬁdence
intervals were reported by means of the Fisher exact test. The length of follow-up was
calculated with a reverse censoring method. OS and PFS were estimated by Kaplan–Meier
survival curves and analyzed by Log Rank tests. All statistical tests were two-sided, and
p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Patient Characteristics

We included 70 tumor specimens of patients diagnosed with HNSCC of the oral cavity,
pharynx and larynx treated at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery
at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between January 2014 and April 2022. Formalin-
ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) slides were retrieved from the institutional pathology
archives for DNA extraction, and DNA samples were processed for TP53 gene sequencing
as previously described. The patients included 41 males and 29 females, with a mean
age of 65 years (range 35–89 years). None of the patients had positive p16 staining as an
indicator of HPV-associated cancer. The majority (61%) were diagnosed with advanced-
stage disease (Stages III and IV). Patient and tumor characteristics are depicted in Table 1
and supplementary Table S3.

3.2. TP53 Genetic Alterations in Tumor Specimens

Libraries of the full coding regions of the TP53 gene were prepared. Overall, we
detected one or more signiﬁcant TP53 mutations (altering at least one amino acid) in
55 tumor specimens (supplementary Table S3), yielding a TP53 mutation rate of 79%. The
mean coverage obtained for all samples was 1217 aligned reads (range 1000–3853).

3.3. Tumor-Speciﬁc TP53 Mutations Detected in Circulating Cell-Free DNA

A plasma sample was collected at the time of tumor resection and available for circu-
lating cell-free DNA analysis in 34 of the 55 patients who had a TP53 mutation identiﬁed
in the tumor DNA. All 34 plasma samples were processed for cell-free DNA isolation.
Noteworthy, the patients whose plasma samples were analyzed (n = 34) and those excluded
from ctDNA analysis because a corresponding plasma sample was unavailable (n = 21) did
not differ in terms of sex, smoking habits, age, tumor site, TNM stage, histopathological
features, or postoperative treatment.

A total of 30 plasma samples had cell-free DNA concentrations sufﬁcient for further
processing (>0.1 ng/µL). Mutation-speciﬁc primer pairs were designed to target and
amplify short amplicons (70–100 bp) around the tumor-speciﬁc TP53 alteration. Ampliﬁed
PCR products were labelled with barcodes and deeply sequenced by the Ion Torrent PGM
(>10,000 reads). The tumor-speciﬁc TP53 genetic alternation was identiﬁed in the circulating
cell-free DNA of 21 patients (70%), as shown in Table 2. The distribution of mutations along
the TP53 gene that were identiﬁed in the tumor specimens and in the matching plasma
samples are depicted in Figure 1.

The cohort of patients included in the circulating cell-free DNA analysis comprised
11 patients with stage I/II disease (37%) and 19 patients with stage III/IV disease (63%). Ten
patients were treated for a recurrent or second primary HNSCC. Fourteen patients received
adjuvant therapy (seven were treated with radiation and another seven with chemoradia-
tion) in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and the
institutional multidisciplinary tumor board discussions. Four patients could not receive
adjuvant therapy (three patients underwent salvage laryngectomy and one had previous
radiation therapy to the head and neck) and one other patient refused adjuvant therapy.
Overall, 8 patients had recurrent disease after curative intent surgery (a median time to
recurrence of 22 months, range 9–52 months), and 10 patients showed disease progression
despite curative-intent therapy.

Fourteen patients received adjuvant therapy (seven were treated with radiation and another seven with chemoradiation) in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guide-lines and the institutional multidisciplinary tumor board discussions. Four patients could not receive adjuvant therapy (three patients underwent salvage laryngectomy and one had previous radiation therapy to the head and neck) and one other patient refused adju-vant therapy. Overall, 8 patients had recurrent disease after curative intent surgery (a Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1418

3.4. The Prognostic Value of Detectable ctDNA

Detectable ctDNA was signiﬁcantly associated with regional spread of disease (N
stage ≥ 1, p = 0.011). Neither the size of the tumor, the pathological T stage, nor the TNM
stage correlated with ctDNA detection. We did, however, observe that several pathological
adverse features, such as larger DOI and WPOI 4–5, were more frequent among patients
whose ctDNA was detected (p = 0.072 and p = 0.087, respectively). Those associations did
not reach a level of signiﬁcance, probably due to the small number of samples. Interestingly,
there were patients with early-stage disease who also had detectable ctDNA but no evidence
of regional spread or any pathological adverse features (Figure 2). Patient 9 (Figure 2)
underwent partial glossectomy and elective ipsilateral supra-omohyoid neck dissection
with radial forearm free ﬂap reconstruction for cT2N0M0 SCC of the tongue. His mutated
TP53 was found in the blood sample drawn at the time of surgical resection. His disease
progressed rapidly in spite of the resection having been oncologically complete (negative
surgical margins >5 mm) and the absence of any adverse pathological features. There had
been no indication for adjuvant therapy postoperatively and the patient died from his
cancer shortly after the surgery. Patients 27 and 64 (Figure 2) also had detectable ctDNA
in the presence of early-stage disease with no adverse features and they both had disease
recurrence. In contrast, patients 33, 52, and 63 (Figure 2) had detectable ctDNA with
early-stage disease, but they did not show any signs of disease recurrence or progression.
The median follow-up time was 16.5 months (range 6–76 months). Kaplan–Meier
survival estimates revealed worse PFS when ctDNA was detected (p = 0.034), as depicted
in Figure 3. A Cox regression model for the estimation of age-adjusted PFS revealed a
hazard ratio of 4.36; 95% conﬁdence interval 1.19–15.98 for detectable ctDNA (p = 0.026).
Interestingly, the presence of TP53 mutations in tumor samples did not correlate with worse
clinical outcomes (Figure S1).

4. Discussion

Despite the great advancement in cancer genomics and sequencing technologies in
recent decades, they have not been widely implemented into clinical practice with the
aim of improving the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patients. Advanced-stage HNSCC, in
particular, portends poor outcomes. New surrogate markers are constantly being sought
to guide treatment selection and possibly expand the scope of personalized medicine in
the expectation of improving outcomes. ctDNA has been proposed for the monitoring and
detection of minimal residual disease in various types of malignant diseases, including
breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer [16,17,19,38,39]. It has also been shown to
reﬂect the tumor mutational load and to possibly indicate the emergence of resistant clones
after therapy [40,41]. Several reports have studied the utility of ctDNA in head and neck
cancer [21–24,42–45], but evidence remains sparse, with the exception of virus-associated
cancers, for which the application of circulating viral DNA for diagnostics and surveillance
has demonstrated much progress [25,26].

Flatch et al. [27] prospectively analyzed 17 patients with HNSCC of whom 5 had
clinical relapse and the detection of ctDNA preceded clinical or CT morphological evidence
of disease recurrence. Those authors suggested that the detection of ctDNA as a marker of
minimal residual disease following curative-intent surgery holds promise for identifying
patients at an increased risk of relapse who may beneﬁt from adjuvant therapy.

We used next-generation sequencing technology to detect TP53-mutated ctDNA and to
assess its potential value as a biomarker for risk stratiﬁcation at the time of curative-intent
surgical resection. We focused on TP53 genetic alternations, given that TP53 is the most
frequently mutated gene in HNSCC [28], and one that is also known to carry prognostic
signiﬁcance [29]. In the comprehensive analysis of 70 HNSCC tumors at various stages
of the disease, we found at least one signiﬁcant TP53 genetic alteration in 79% of the
tumor samples, which is consistent with previous studies that reported ~85% somatically
mutated TP53 genes in smoking-related HNSCC [21,28]. The unique mutation detected in
each tumor guided the search for the tumor-speciﬁc mutation in the circulating cell-free
DNA. In the ensuing analysis of 30 matching plasma samples obtained perioperatively, we
employed the targeted sequencing approach and found a corresponding TP53 mutation
in the circulating cell-free DNA in 21 cases, representing a ctDNA detection rate of 70%.
This approach relies upon prior knowledge of the tumor’s mutational proﬁle to detect the
tumor-speciﬁc mutation, and it enables a detection rate above the background error rate as

Discussion  Despite the great advancement in cancer genomics and sequencing technologies in recent decades, they have not been widely implemented into clinical practice with the aim of improving the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patients. Advanced-stage HNSCC, in par-ticular, portends poor outcomes. New surrogate markers are constantly being sought to guide treatment selection and possibly expand the scope of personalized medicine in the expectation of improving outcomes. ctDNA has been proposed for the monitoring and detection of minimal residual disease in various types of malignant diseases, including breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer [16,17,19,38,39].

Flatch et al. [27] prospectively analyzed 17 patients with HNSCC of whom 5 had clin-ical relapse and the detection of ctDNA preceded clinical or CT morphological evidence of disease recurrence. Those authors suggested that the detection of ctDNA as a marker of minimal residual disease following curative-intent surgery holds promise for identify-ing patients at an increased risk of relapse who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. We used next-generation sequencing technology to detect TP53-mutated ctDNA and to assess its potential value as a biomarker for risk stratification at the time of curative-intent surgical resection. We focused on TP53 genetic alternations, given that TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in HNSCC [28], and one that is also known to carry prog-nostic significance [29].

This approach relies upon prior knowledge of the tumor’s mutational profile to detect the tumor-specific mutation, and it enables a detection rate above the background error rate as opposed to labelling mutations de novo. It also provides high specificity. Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1418

opposed to labelling mutations de novo. It also provides high speciﬁcity. Comparable rates
of ctDNA detection were described by Mes et al. [43] and Harper et al. [45], who reported
67% and 73% detection rates, respectively. However, reported rates are variable, ranging
between 40% to 100%, depending upon the genetic proﬁling methodology and the inclusion
of HPV-associated cancer, a factor that bestows favorable detection rates. Perdomo et al. [22]
used the targeted approach and reported curative intent ctDNA detection in 42% of their
patients, while Wang et al. [21] achieved a 87% detection rate in the plasma and a 96%
detection rate when combining plasma and saliva (notably, 21 of their 47 patients had
HPV-associated HNSCC).

Whether or not the ctDNA load represents tumor dynamics is incompletely under-
stood. We had earlier studied the kinetics of ctDNA in an animal model of HPV-associated
HNSCC and revealed a correlation between tumor burden and ctDNA levels released into
the circulation [46]. We monitored primary tumor and metastatic lymph node volume by
computed tomography and found that ctDNA detection could precede evidence of tumor
recurrence as depicted on a scan. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of ctDNA detection in that
model was 90.2% (95% conﬁdence interval: 76.9–97.3%) and 85.7% (95% conﬁdence interval:
67.3–96.0%), respectively. Correlation between ctDNA loads and disease extent has also
been reported in clinical studies on several cancers, with increased amounts of ctDNA
having been noted with increased tumor burden [16,38]. Patients with advanced-stage
and metastatic cancer were reported to have higher levels of ctDNA [16,20,47]. Mazurek
et al. [48] evaluated HPV DNA detection in plasma samples of HNSCC patients and found
higher levels of cell-free DNA in patients with clinical N2-N3 disease compared to N0-N1
disease, as well as in patients with stage IV disease compared to stages I-III. In contrast,
Wang et al. [21], who reported the largest cohort of HNSCC patients to date, found little
difference between the detectability of ctDNA with respect to the stage of disease. When
segregated by nodal status, tumor-speciﬁc DNA was detectable in the plasma or saliva
of 83% (n = 59) and 100% (n = 34) of their patients with or without nodal metastasis,
respectively. Those authors did, however, report higher sensitivity of ctDNA detection
for stage III-IV disease (92%, n = 37) compared to stage I–II disease (70%, n = 10). The
association between ctDNA detection and stage of disease may indicate its prognostic
utility. Detectable ctDNA in breast and ovarian cancer patients has been found to be a
more signiﬁcant prognostic predictor than commonly used tumor markers [16,49]. In our
cohort, the regional spread of disease correlated signiﬁcantly with the detection of ctDNA
(p = 0.011).

We also noted poorer PFS of patients with detectable ctDNA in the blood sampled
at the time of surgical resection of the tumor (p = 0.034). The high-risk worst pattern
of invasion (WPOI 4–5) and depth of invasion were frequently documented in the cases
ctDNA was detected (p = 0.087 and p = 0.072, respectively). Another ﬁnding that supports
the prognostic value of ctDNA detection at the time of initial surgical resection is that 9 of
the 10 patients who relapsed shortly after curative-intent surgery had detectable TP53-
mutated ctDNA (Figure 2). Speciﬁcally, disease progression was noted in two patients with
no other clinical or pathological indicators of aggressive disease. Patient 9 with a T2N0
SCC of the tongue (Figure 2) had no pathological adverse feature to justify consideration
for adjuvant therapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.
The disease state of patient 57 (Figure 2) with locally advanced T4aN0 laryngeal SCC who
underwent total laryngectomy progressed despite adjuvant radiotherapy. Both of those
two latter patients might have possibly beneﬁted from more intensiﬁed treatment regimens.
Contrarily, there were other patients (33, 34, 52, and 63 in Figure 2) who had detectable
ctDNA at the time of tumor resection and no evidence of disease progression or relapse
during follow-up.

In order to expand the implementation of ctDNA into clinical practice as a biomarker
for risk stratiﬁcation, it will be necessary to further explore the mechanisms that modulate
ctDNA release and clearance from the bloodstream. It is widely accepted that the main
sources of ctDNA are cellular breakdown processes, such as apoptosis, necrosis, and

Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1418

autophagy, although active release has also been demonstrated [9,50]. ctDNA levels were
found to correspond to hypoxic stress [51], possibly by promoting cell death. Thierry
et al. [9] suggested that the total amounts of circulating DNA can represent tumor dynamics
and clonal heterogeneity over time and that this association may derive from increased
levels of cell death in larger tumor masses. It may also indicate tumor aggressiveness [52],
since total circulating DNA concentration was also shown to correlate with OS [53,54]. The
association between OS and ctDNA in HNSCC remains unresolved. For example, Harper
et al. [45] reported that the presence of ctDNA alterations was associated with decreased
OS (hazards rato 3.5, p = 0.042), while Perdomo et al. [22] found no such association. We
observed a signiﬁcant correlation between ctDNA detection and worse PFS (Figure 3).

This study has several limitations. We focused upon the TP53 gene, which carries
high rates of mutations in HNSCC, but this selective approach is expected to detect genetic
alterations in only ~85% of cases. Expanding the panel of the tested genes to include
PIK3CA, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 may increase the detection rate to >95%. Having
included only a small number of early-stage HNSCC cases might have affected our ﬁndings,
but, unfortunately, it represents real-life practice since most HNSCC patients are diagnosed
with an advanced-stage disease. Although we found that tumor-speciﬁc genetic alternations
can be detected even when they are low in number, tumor heterogeneity and propagation
of a certain sub-clonal population could meaningfully dispute the use of a speciﬁc genetic
mutation as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker. To determine if TP53-mutated ctDNA
can serve as a surrogate marker of disease burden, it would be necessary to determine
if treatment results in the clearance of TP53-mutated DNA in circulation, which was not
included in this study design. Finally, the small sample size likely affected the survival
analyses. Further analytical and clinical validation are needed in larger-scale studies.

5. Conclusions

ctDNA analysis is already transitioning from the research setting into clinical practice.
It has been proposed as a promising prognostic biomarker that deﬁnes the subset of patients
at high risk of recurrence in colorectal and breast cancer. In the current study, we show that
by utilizing highly sensitive genetic sequencing technologies, tumor-speciﬁc TP53 genetic
alterations can be identiﬁed in the plasma of HNSCC patients upon tumor resection, even at
low abundance, and that they are associated with poorer PFS. However, the potential use of
TP53-mutated ctDNA for risk stratiﬁcation and guidance of more radical treatment selection
must be further evaluated in larger prospective studies prior to its clinical application.
