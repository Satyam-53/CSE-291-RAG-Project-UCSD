Identifying triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients expected to have poor outcomes provides an opportunity to enhance
clinical management. We applied an Evolutionary Action Score to functionally characterize TP53 mutations (EAp53) in 96 TNBC
patients and observed that EAp53 stratiﬁcation may identify TP53 mutations associated with worse outcomes. These ﬁndings merit
further exploration in larger TNBC cohorts and in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.

INTRODUCTION
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) has typically been treated
with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), but
about half such patients fail to achieve a pathologic compete
response (pCR) at the time of surgery1–4. The high prevalence
(60%) of TP53 mutations (TP53mut) in TNBC makes it an attractive
therapeutic target and marker to predict chemotherapy sensitiv-
ity5–7; however, the functional signiﬁcance of individual TP53mut
remain unclear8–13. Mutational diversity suggests that not all
TP53mut are equivalent and that alterations to speciﬁc protein
domains will have differential effects on the gain-of-function
oncogenic activity, including chemotherapy resistance9,14–17. The
computational Evolutionary Action Score of TP53 coding variants
(EAp53) offers an alternative approach to functionally characteriz-
ing TP53mut and predicting NACT response15,18,19. EAp53
incorporates evolutionary variations to predict the impact of
somatic mutations on likelihood of amino acid substitution and
p53 protein function20. We report on the identity and prognostic
value of TP53mut and EAp53 in a single institution cohort of
patients with primary TNBC.

Among 96 patients enrolled in this study (MDACC Protocol #
2011-0007), 55 (57%) had a TP53mut, the majority (76%) of which
were missense mutations (TP53mis; Fig. 1a, Supplemental Table 1).
Table 1 summarizes clinical characteristics by TP53mut status.
Median follow-up was 6 years from diagnosis, with 21 observed
deaths (22% of patients); 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 82%
and median OS was not reached. Nineteen patients (20%) had a
documented local or distant recurrence of disease, and the 3-year
recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 79%. Patients with TP53mut
tumors had slightly lower RFS compared to those with TP53wt
tumors at 77.9% (95%CI 64.4–86.8) vs. 80.0% (95%CI 64.4%–89.5%)
respectively, and HR of 1.15 (95%CI 0.52–2.54,
at 3 years,
p = 0.726). The inferior OS in TP53mut compared to TP53wt
patients (81.3% [95%CI 68.0–89.5] vs. 90.0% [95%CI 75.5%–96.1%];
HR 1.54 [95%CI 0.62–3.82], p = 0.351) was also non-signiﬁcant.

Seven patients with TP53mut in a residue outside the DNA-
binding domain (predominantly in the tetramerization domain,
Fig. 1a) had markedly worse RFS (Fig. 1b; adjusted HR 3.17 [95%CI
0.98–10.22] vs. TP53wt, p = 0.054) and OS (Fig. 1a; adjusted HR
5.28 [95%CI 1.53–18.25] vs. TP53wt, p = 0.008), even when
controlling for prognostic factors (i.e., age at diagnosis for RFS
and clinical node positivity for RFS and OS). Survival estimates

were similar in DNA-binding domain TP53mut and TP53wt patients
(Fig. 1b, Supplemental Fig. 1A, B and Supplemental Table 2).

After applying the EAp53 algorithm15,18,20–22, patients were
placed into one of four groups: TP53wt (n = 41) were assigned a
score of 0 (i.e., EAp53 0), patients with a nonsense mutation
(TP53non, n = 13) had a score of 100 (i.e., EAp53 100), and the
remaining patients with missense mutations were divided into
two groups that maximized the difference in RFS: EAp53 1-69
(n = 6; 4 patients with TP53mut in the DNA-binding domain) and
EAp53 70-99 (n = 36; all patients with TP53mut in the DNA-binding
domain). Patients with EAp53 1-69 had signiﬁcantly worse RFS
(50% [95%CI 11.1%–80.4%]; HR 4.17 [95%CI 1.41–12.31], p = 0.010)
than those with EAp53 0 (80% [95%CI 64.0%–89.5%]) (Fig. 1c,
Supplemental Fig. 1C). Controlling for age at TNBC diagnosis and
clinical nodal status characteristics signiﬁcantly correlated with
recurrence or death, and did not dampen the effect of EAp53 1-69
on RFS (adjusted HR 3.90 [95%CI 1.30–11.67] vs. TP53wt, p = 0.015)
(Supplemental Table 2). Additionally, patients with EAp53 1-69
had a higher risk of death (OS rate of 66.7% [95%CI 19.5%–90.4%];
HR 5.33 [95%CI 1.55–18.39], p = 0.008) compared to EAp53 0
patients (OS rate 90.0% [95%CI 75.5%–96.1%])
(Supplemental
Table 2). This ﬁve-fold increase in the risk of death for EAp53 1-69
TP53mis compared to TP53wt patients persisted when controlling
for clinical nodal status in the multivariable setting (adjusted HR
5.10 [95%CI 1.47–17.72], p = 0.010). There was little difference in
RFS when comparing EAp53 0 to EAp53 70-99 (82.9% [95%CI
65.9%–91.9%]; HR 0.76 [95%CI 0.29–1.99], p = 0.571) and to EAp53
100 (76.9% [95%CI 44.2%–91.9%]; HR 1.18 [95%CI 0.37–3.78],
p = 0.776) (Fig. 1c, Supplemental Table 2). As with RFS, OS for the
EAp53 70-99 and EAp53 100 groups did not signiﬁcantly differ
from EAp53 0 (Supplemental Fig. 1C, Supplemental Table 2).

Among patients receiving NACT (n = 68), 25 (37%) achieved a
pCR, and 43 (63%) had residual disease (Supplemental Table 3).
Regardless of TP53mut
status at TNBC diagnosis, patients
achieving pCR after NACT had excellent outcomes, with 100%
RFS at 3 years post-surgery (Fig. 1d). The lone signiﬁcant predictor
of pCR was clinical ≥N1 stage (odds ratio 0.30 [95%CI 0.10–0.83],
p = 0.022); however, a noteworthy difference in pCR rates was
observed between EAp53 groups, with 48% achieving pCR (12 of
25 patients) for EAp53 70-99, 45% (5 of 11) for EAp53 100, 31%
pCR (8 of 26) for EAp53 0, and 0% pCR (0 of 6) for EAp53 1-69.

Among the 43 patients who failed to achieve a pCR after NACT,
tumors had inferior RFS (56.0% [95%CI

1.93–25.10], p = 0.003)
than TP53wt. Among non-responding
patients, estimated RFS was longest for EAp53 0 (TP53wt), and
shortest for EAp53 1-69 (50.0% [95%CI 11.1%–80.4%]; HR 3.31
[95%CI 1.00–11.02] vs. TP53wt, p = 0.051) and for EAS 100 (50.0%

Understanding the functional

impact of TP53 mutations on
treatment response and outcomes remains an elusive topic in
cancer research and an area of active investigation6,8,17,23–25. In
this study, the small group of patients harboring a missense
mutation with EAp53 1-69 had the lowest pCR rate and shortest
RFS and OS. The six speciﬁc mutations (listed in Supplemental
Table 1) are uncommon in breast cancer, each occurring in
<0.05% of cases according to the cBioPortal public data repository
(24 studies comprising >10,000 cases, accessed 4-12-2022)26,27.
Moreover, their functional signiﬁcance remains largely unknown.

autophagy via mTOR and AMPK signaling, which is associated
with resistance to anti-cancer therapy28,29. The F270 position
within the DNA-binding domain is important for stabilizing the
beta-sandwich structure of the p53 protein, and mutation to
leucine is predicted to be a druggable target for small molecules
to stabilize this type of p53 mutant30–32. Mutations at the R337
residue have a role in p53 methylation and ubiquitination, and
R337L is thought to promote stability and sub-cellular localization
of p5333,34. To our knowledge, the function of L308P, V274A, and
K132R mutations have not been biochemically characterized35,36.
The majority (80%) of TP53 mutations occur within the DNA-
binding domain37. These mutations produce a defunct transcrip-
tional product that is unable to respond to cellular stress,;
resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis after chemother-
apy that occurs independent of p5338–40. The transcriptional
activity of p53 is largely dependent on tetramerization of
individual p53 monomers. While mutations in the tetrameric
region are less common (~20%), they can impact conformation of
the DNA-binding domain,
interaction with the transcriptional
machinery, and p53 localization41,42. We observed that TP53mut
occurring outside the DNA-binding domain (13% of TP53mut in
our patient set) was associated with shorter RFS and OS
compared to TP53wt or TP53mut in the DNA-binding domain.
One of the mutations in the EAp53 1-69 group is also present
within the tetrameric domain; however, the signiﬁcance of any
biological association remains to be determined, and further
investigation may provide mechanistic insight into the poor
outcomes observed in this study.

This single center study has several limitations, including a
small sample size that led to wide conﬁdence intervals and
precluded us from validating our optimal EAp53 cut-point for
missense mutations. Additionally, given the period during which
our patients were treated, adjuvant capecitabine was not widely
used for residual disease following NACT (non-pCR at the time
of surgery), so the prognostic impact of adjuvant capecitabine,
and its association with TP53 mutation status, could not be
captured. Similarly, use of pembrolizumab, which is becoming
standards of care, could not be addressed here. Furthermore,
we did not evaluate immune inﬁltrates or the presence of other
genomic alterations that may impact efﬁcacy of NACT and
overall prognosis.

In this hypothesis-generating study, we identiﬁed two patient
subsets (one deﬁned by TP53mut location outside the DNA-
binding domain and the other by TP53mis EAp53 1-69)
demonstrating limited response to NACT and relatively high risk
of disease recurrence and death. Our results also indicate that
TP53mut corresponds with worse outcomes among patients with
residual disease following NACT. These ﬁndings warrant further

there was no adjustment for multiple tests (i.e., across univariable models
and different outcomes). Analyses were performed and survival plots were
created using R version 4.1.0.

Reporting summary
Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research
Reporting Summary linked to this article.

METHODS
Patients
The TNBC patient cohort for this study consisted of 96 women treated at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Breast
Center between 2011 and 2016. The study was approved by the MDACC
institutional
review board (MDACC IRB#2011-0007). Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment. Patient
demographics, tumor characteristics and treatment, surgical, pathological,
and survival data were collected. TP53 mutational status was determined
through RNA sequencing using Nanodrop™ spectrophotometer (concen-
tration, 260:280 OD ratio) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer (RNA integrity
number [RIN] and RNA 28 S:18 S ratio).

EAp53 Computation
Missense TP53 mutations were analyzed using the Evolutionary Action
Scoring (EAS) System as previously described15,18. This Scoring System is
based on the hypothesis that protein evolution is a continuous and
differentiable process between genotype and phenotype. Therefore, if the
phenotype (φ) is a function of the genotype (γ), φ = f (γ), then a change in
phenotype (dφ) is equal to the scalar product of the gradient of the
function (∇f) and the change in genotype (dγ). When considering a single
mutation from amino acid X to any other amino acid Y at sequence
position i, the genotype perturbation reduces to the magnitude of that
substitution, denoted Δri;X!Y , and is measured by the ranks of amino acid
substitution odds46; however, these odds are computed for different
deciles of the evolutionary gradient at the substituted position. The
gradient (∇f) reduces to the partial derivative of the evolutionary ﬁtness
function for its ith component, denoted ∂f/∂ri, and is measured by
importance ranks of the Evolutionary Trace (ET) method21,22, according to
which, residues that vary amongst closer homologous sequences are
ranked less important
than those that only vary amongst distant
homologous sequences. This forms the equation: Δφ ≈ ∂f/·Δri;X!Y.

The result of this equation is normalized to create percentile scores for
TP53 protein; for example, an EAS of 68 implies that the impact is >68% of
all possible amino acid substitutions in p53. TP53 missense mutations were
given EAp53 percentile scores, with higher scores representing alterations
that are more impactful, according to ET theory. Wild-type TP53 sequences
were scored as zero as this is the normally functioning protein and
nonsense mutations were assigned a score of 100 to account for a
truncated, non-functional protein.

Statistical analysis
Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were summarized separately
for TP53wt and TP53mut patients and compared across these groups using
Fisher’s exact test (for categorical variables) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test
(for continuous variables). Patients with a TP53 missense mutation (EAp53
1-99) were divided into 2 groups by applying an optimal cut-point that was
identiﬁed as the EAp53 value that maximized the RFS log-rank test statistic
for the resulting 2-group comparison. Therefore, creation of the EAp53
1-69 and 70-99 groups was a data-driven approach that (i) resulted in an
RFS-optimized dichotomization of TP53mis patients and (ii)
requires
validation in an independent dataset. RFS and OS were measured from
the date of TNBC diagnosis (if the predictor variables were known at this
time) or the date of resection (e.g., for pCR status as the predictor),
estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, and compared with the log-rank
test. All reported survival percentages pertain to 3 years post-diagnosis or
post-surgery, depending on when the predictor variable was known. Cox
proportional hazards regression models were ﬁt to estimate hazard ratios
(and compute Wald test p-values) that quantify the association between
predictor variables and survival. An AIC-based backward elimination
procedure was used to construct multivariable survival models from a set
of predictors with univariable model p-values < 0.20. Associations between
pre-treatment patient
features and pCR were assessed with logistic
regression. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant and
