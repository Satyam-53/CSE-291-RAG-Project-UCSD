Short Communications Editorial Process: Submission:07/30/2024 Acceptance:01/11/2025 Prognosis of TP53 and Its Concomitant EGFR Mutation in Lung Cancer Especially Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Anurag Mehta1,2, Arpita Ghosh Mitra1*, Samson Mani1, Himanshi Dewan2, Sakshi Mattoo2, Ullas Batra3 Background: Human Lung Carcinoma (LC) is among the most diagnosed cancers across the world among those non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises about 85%. Next Generation Sequencing based detection of mutations are now well established in molecular oncology. With the advent of modern diagnostic methods, it is now well known that there are several mutations and gene rearrangements which are associated with the development of LC. Among those mutations, TP53 is the most prevalent with the concomitant EGFR mutation. Methods: In this retrospective study, a total number of 414 patients have been incorporated who have attended RGCIRC in the period between November 2015 to March 2024. Clinical stage has been determined as per NCCN Guideline version 2.2024. Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) from FFPE samples were extracted and detection of mutation was performed by Next generation sequencing (NGS) method. Results: All 414 patients opted for the customised NGS panel for lung cancer among those 203 patients were TP53 mutation and 87 patients were EGFR mutation positive. 62 patients were TP53-EGFR double mutation positive. The results of this study have shown that TP53 mutated patients show poor prognosis with conventional therapy. However, TP53-EGFR co-mutated patient’s recovery rates are comparatively promising due to the availability of the targeted therapy of EGFR. Conclusion: Studies have shown that TP53 mutation is unlikely to derive clinical benefit in LC patients and shows poorer prognosis when compared to TP53 wild type and EGFR mutated patients show improved recovery due to availability of the Kinase Inhibitor (KI) treatment. In this study we have observed and concluded that TP53-EGFR co-mutated group also shows promising prognosis for the application of KI treatment. A further large cohort study will establish this clinical observation and enlighten more therapeutically relevant information. Keywords: Lung carcinoma- TP53 mutation- EGFR co-mutation- prognosis Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 26 (1), 17-22 Lung Cancer (LC) is one of the deadliest diseases in the world consisting of 5.9 percent of all cancers diagnoses in India and Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85%. TP53 gene is supposed to function as tumor suppressor, but mutated TP53 contributed to the tumorigenesis of the lung epithelial cells, playing a significant role in the development of lung cancer. It has a role in distant metastases, worsening the outcome of LC Prognosis. Mutant TP53 is known to show resistance to standard chemotherapy medications, often making a condition untreatable. There are reports that 30 percent of TP53 mutation occurs alongside concomitant EGFR mutation. Kinase Inhibitor (KI) therapy in EGFR mutated patients produces superior results in comparison to traditional therapy. Studies have shown that, when TP53 mutation is concomitant with EGFR mutation, the standard 3rd generation EGFR-TKI therapy becomes less effective in producing results when it is compared with TP53 wild type or EGFR single mutation in LC patients [1, 2]. In this study, we have included those who are affected by TP53 mutation as well as associated other co-mutations with a special focus on EGFR. Our aim is to explore the comparative prognosis or percentage of patient survival of TP53 wild type and mutated group, and EGFR wild type and mutated group, TP53-EGFR double mutated group.

Among those 203 patients were TP53 mutation positive. Clinical stage has been determined as per NCCN Guideline version 2.2024. The pathogenicity of somatic variants is determined predominantly based on the clinical data reported in ClinVar, ACMG recommendation, AMP guidelines, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The Stratification has been defined based on their allele frequency, translational activity, conservation, amino acid physiochemical properties, in silico observations etc. Assessment and Comparison of Single Nucleotide variants SNVs have also been started for the identification of variants and their clinical association. The follow-up information was obtained by either reviewing the medical records or by telephonic interview [3, 4]. Flow chart describing enrollment of patients needs to show up Assessment of Mutation by NGS Lung Panel Detection of mutation was performed by Next generation sequencing (NGS) method (Iron torrent, Ion GeneStudio S5 plus System). Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) from FFPE samples were extracted by ReliaPrep FFPE Miniprep System from Promega, Library preparation was performed by Ion Ampliseq library kit plus. The assay utilizes a minimum of 20ng DNA and 20ng RNA at 500X coverage and provides an analytical sensitivity of more than equal to 5 percent for DNA based genetic alterations. Customized Panel for Multi - Biomarker NGS Assay Statistical Analyses Statistical analysis has been performed using MS Excel, IBM SPSS version 29.0. Descriptive statistics have been applied for demographic information. Measures include summary statistics such as Median (Range) for continuous variable and frequency (percentage) for categorical variable. TP53 subgroups and baseline characteristics including gender, age, stage, smoking status, comorbidity, family history, metastasis status, tumour size and vital status information have been screened. Kaplan Meier statistical approach has been performed to determine the overall survival (OS) graph over time and estimated per cent survival of the subjects at each point of time. Log rank test has been applied for comparing the significant differences between groups. Statistical significance has been determined by two tailed p<0.05. A total number of 414 patients have been incorporated in this study who has attended RGCIRC in the period between November 2015 to March 2024. Among those, there are 203 patients who exhibit TP53 mutation. Total Number of EGFR mutated patients are 87, among those, EGFR-TP53 double mutated patients are 62. In TP53 mutated group, mean age is 60.3 years. Male and female ratio is 145:58. In this cohort, most prevalent is stage IV (84%) and 37.4% of patients have smoking history. LC patients with TP53 mutation, exhibit comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus (22.7%) and 18 Hypertension (30%). About 15.8% patients have family history of cancer. In this cohort, LC patients with TP53 mutation, exhibit brain metastases 35%, liver metastases 12.8% and bone metastases 24.1%. 54.2% TP53 mutated LC patients exhibit tumour size >2 cm. In this tenure 88.2% patients are alive (Table 1). To compare the prognosis and patient overall survival (OS) in TP53 mutated and EGFR co-mutated patients, they have been subdivided into 4 groups. TP53 wild type and EGFR wild type, TP53 wild type and EGFR mutated, TP53 mutated and EGFR wild type, TP53 mutated, and EGFR mutated. All TP53 and EGFR wild type and mutated groups are co-existent with other mutations viz. KRAS, BRAF, EML4-ALK, STK11, KEAP1, KIF5B-RET, SMARCA4, PTEN, RB1. Aside from these four groups, difference of OS has been determined between TP53-other gene mutated and TP53-EGFR mutated groups. Overall survival of TP53 wild type patient’s group has been compared with EGFR wild type patient group (Figure 1A). The OS of the cohort is 78.5% in 102 months with median duration 19 months. Percentage of survival in EGFR wild type group is inferior (77.4%) to TP53 wild type group (81%). In the TP53 wild type group median survival is 20 months, 95% CI 9.5 – 30.4. In EGFR wild type group median survival is 19 months, 95% CI 13.524.4. Calculated survival probability (p value) between the groups is 0.739. Overall survival comparison between TP53 wild type and EGFR mutated patient groups has been calculated (Figure 1B). TP53 wild type group has shown decreased survival than EGFR mutated patient group.

OS comparison between TP53 mutated and EGFR mutated patient groups has been calculated (Figure 1C). TP53 mutated group has shown inferior survival to EGFR mutated patient group. The OS of the cohort is 83% in 102 months with median duration 21 months. Percentage of survival in TP53 mutated group is lesser (80.7%) than EGFR mutated group (88.4%). In the TP53 mutated group median survival is 25 months, 95% CI 0.0 – 54.4. In EGFR mutated group median survival is 21 months, 95% CI 13.8 – 28.1. Calculated survival probability (p value) between the groups is 0.205. Overall survival comparison calculated between TP53 mutated and EGFR wild type patient groups (Figure 1D). EGFR wild type group has shown decreased survival compared to TP53 mutated patient group. The OS of the cohort is 79.1% in 102 months with median duration 19 months. Percentage of survival in TP53 mutated group is higher (80.7%) than EGFR wild type group (77.4%). In the TP53 mutated group median survival is 25 months, 95% CI 0.0 – 54.4. In EGFR wild type group median survival is 19 months, 95% CI 13.5 – 24.4. Calculated survival probability (p value) between the groups is 0.426. OS comparison calculated between TP53-other mutated, and TP53-EGFR mutated patient groups (Figure 1E). TP53-other gene co-mutated group has shown inferior survival compared to TP53-EGFR double mutated patient group. Percentage of survival in TP53-other gene 20 Anurag Mehta et alAsian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 26 mutated group is lesser (70.9%) than TP53-EGFR mutated group (90.2%). In the TP53-other gene mutated group median survival is 18 months and in TP53-EGFR wild type group median survival is 19 months, Overall, 95% CI is 10.6 – 27.3. Calculated survival probability (p value) between the groups is 0.031. Figure 1(E), suggests that when TP53-EGFR double mutated group OS is compared with TP53-other gene mutated group (for e.g. KRAS, MET, ROS, EML4-ALK etc.), TP53-EGFR mutated group with KI treatment have shown better prognosis and survival (p=0.031). [10, 11, 12]. In conclusion, this can be mentioned that the presence of TP53 mutation leads to increased risk of fatality, which is amplified due to the presence of other co-mutations despite the traditional chemotherapeutic treatments. On the contrary, TP53-EGFR co-mutated patients recovery rates are much more promising due to the availability of the targeted therapy. Further prospective study would help to understand the pathways through which EGFR-KI therapy acts effectively even in the presence of TP53 mutation to strengthen and establish our observation. Author Contribution Statement The p53 directly influences transcription of genes which are involved in metastasis by binding promoters of a variety of genes known to be involved in regulating cell motility and adhesion processes that are important for metastasis. In this study the percentage of metastases in the vital organs like brain, liver, bone is quite high in TP53 mutated group. Apart from these, thyroid, oral cavity, buccal mucosa, thorax, colon, uterine metastases have also been observed. Most prevalent clinical stage found is stage IV. It has been observed that patient’s age (>60 years), male gender and smoking status are the other parameters which are associated with poor prognosis in TP53 mutated group [5, 6, 7]. The complete loss of TP53 functions can accelerate the transformation potential for driver oncogenes in lung cancers. The p53 loss not only prevents incipient tumor cells from undergoing oncogene-induced senescence and apoptosis but also perturbs cell cycle checkpoints. This enables p53-deficient tumor cells with DNA damage to continue cycling, creating a permissive environment for the acquisition of additional mutations. In this study we found >50% TP53 mutations are associated with other Co-Mutations viz. EGFR, KRAS, EML4-ALK etc. [7, 8]. In this study, TP53 with concomitant EGFR mutation are treated with EGFR-KI, whereas TP53 with other mutations have been treated by chemotherapy and or anti- angiogenic medications. In the 4 subgroups of TP53 wild type and mutated, EGFR wild type and mutated, Kaplan– Meier (KM) survival curve analysis shows that overall survival (OS) is better in patients with concomitant EGFR mutations who received treatment of Kinase Inhibitors (KI) preferentially . Superior prognosis was observed in a group which received KI therapy due to presence of EGFR mutation. The prognosis and overall survival of TP53 mutated group is inferior to EGFR mutated group suggesting presence of TP53 mutation leads to poor treatment efficacy in LC patients. EGFR wild type group which received traditional therapy, showed worse prognosis due to the presence of other co-mutations. The prognosis is worse in the group afflicted by TP53 mutation compared to TP53 wild type. Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrates that the possibility of survival is much higher in the group with TP53-EGFR co-mutation because of the KI treatment, compared to group with TP53-other gene mutations where EGFR is absent. TP53 wild type group also fails to show good prognosis if there are presence of other mutations AM conceptualised the study, AGM analysed the data and written the manuscript, SM reviewed the manuscript and made necessary changes, SM and SD performed the laboratory testing and report authorisation, UB provided the patient samples.
