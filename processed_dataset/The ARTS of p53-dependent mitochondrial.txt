The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to induce cell death, including apoptosis, through 
transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. On the one hand, nuclear p53 transcriptionally activates the 
expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such as NOXA , PUMA , BID , BAD , BIK , BAX , etc., whereas it inactivates 
the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 , BCL-X L , and MCL1 , leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. On the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 
also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria. Apoptosis- 
related protein in TGF- β signaling pathway ( ARTS ) , a mitochondria-localized pro-apoptotic protein encoded by an alternative spliced 
variant of the SEPT4 gene, triggers apoptosis by facilitating proteasomal degradation of BCL-2 and XIAP upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. 
We recently identiﬁed SEPT4/ARTS as a new p53 target gene in response to genotoxic stress. ARTS in turn binds to p53, drives its 
mitochondrial localization, and enhances the interaction between p53 and BCL-X L , thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. This 
review will illustrate the mechanisms of p53-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, oﬀer some recently discovered new insights into the 
functions of ARTS in regulating mitochondrial cell death, and discuss the clinical signiﬁcance of ARTS in cancer and non-cancer 
diseases.

Introduction 

The  ﬁne  balance  between  cell  survival  and  death  is  vital 
for  organism  growth  and  development.  However,  disruption 
of this balance  leads to  various diseases,  including  cancer. 
Programmed cell death was ﬁrst observed in the development 
of toads in the 1840s ( Cotter, 2009 ) . One of the major forms 
of programmed cell death is apoptosis, which can be initiated 
through  either  the  extrinsic  or  the  intrinsic  pathway.  The 
protease activity of caspases is crucial to the morphological and

biochemical changes of apoptotic cells ( Marino et al., 2014 ; 
Ichim and Tait, 2016 ) . In the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, the 
death  receptors  upon  binding  by  their  cognate  ligands  can 
activate  the  initiator  caspases,  caspase-8  and  caspase-10, 
which in turn mediate the cleavage of the eﬀectors, caspase-3, 
caspase-6, and caspase-7, consequently leading to apoptosis 
( Ichim and Tait, 2016 ) . The intrinsic apoptotic pathway, also 
known as mitochondrial apoptosis, involves a complex interplay 
between  the  pro-apoptotic  and  anti-apoptotic  BCL-2  family 
proteins ( Singh et al., 2019 ) . Upon various stress signals, the

Figure 1 p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic signaling network. Nuclear p53 transcriptionally activates the expression of PUMA, NOXA, 
BID, BAD, BIM, BIK, BAX, and APAF1, but represses the expression of BCL-2, BCL-X L , and MCL1. In addition, p53 may induce BMF expression 
through the FBXW7–YTHDF2 cascade. With the aid of ARTS, MDMX, and PTMs, cytoplasmic p53 can translocate to the mitochondria to interact 
with BAX, BAK, BCL-2, BCL-X L , and MCL1, consequently inducing apoptosis. 

phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced  protein  1  ( PMAIP1, 
also  known  as  NOXA ) ,  and  p53-upregulated  modulator  of 
apoptosis ( PUMA ) , can be triggered to interact with and activate 
the  pore-forming  proteins,  BCL-2-associated  X  protein  ( BAX ) 
and BCL-2 antagonist/killer 1 ( BAK, also known as BAK1 ) , at 
the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to mitochondrial 
outer membrane permeabilization ( MOMP ) and the release of 
cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of cas- 
pases ( SMAC ) , and serine protease HTRA2/OMI. Cytochrome c 
associates with apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 ( APAF1 ) 
in  the  cytoplasm  to  form  the  apoptosome  and  facilitate 
caspase-9  activation,  while  SMAC and  HTRA2/OMI  suppress 
the anti-apoptotic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( XIAP ) . 
These  signals  are  committed  to  mediating  the  cleavage  of 
the eﬀector caspases and triggering apoptosis ( Singh et al., 
2019 ) . To circumvent apoptosis and sustain their own survival 
and  propagation,  cancer  cells employ the  multi-BH  domain- 
containing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, such as BCL-2, 
BCL-X L ( the longer isoform of BCL2L1 ) , and MCL1, to repress the 
pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins by directly associating with 
the latter ( Green, 2022 ) . This complicated apoptotic process is 
ﬁnely tuned by various regulators in cancer cells. 

One of the important regulators is the tumor suppressor p53. 
p53 is regarded as the ‘guardian of the genome’ because of its 
important role in preventing tumorigenesis and inhibiting cancer 
progression ( Levine, 2020 ) . In response to various stresses, p53 
is activated through diﬀerent post-translational modiﬁcations 
( PTMs ) ( Liu et al., 2019 ; Wen and Wang, 2022 ) to act as either a 
transcription factor in the nucleus ( Riley et al., 2008 ) or an apop- 
tosis inducer in the cytoplasm ( Green and Kroemer, 2009 ) . On 

the one hand, p53 suppresses cancer development by transcrip- 
tionally regulating the expression of myriad genes ( Riley et al., 
2008 ) . These downstream target genes are responsible for dif- 
ferent biological processes, such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, 
and apoptosis ( Levine, 2019 , 2020 ) . On the other hand, the cy- 
toplasmic p53 protein induces apoptosis by directly interacting 
with multiple BCL-2 family proteins ( Green and Kroemer, 2009 ) . 
However, p53-dependent apoptosis is causative for develop- 
mental abnormalities when p53 is inappropriately activated dur- 
ing embryonic and postnatal development ( Bowen and Attardi, 
2019 ) . For instance, germline mutations or haploinsuﬃciency of 
ribosome biogenesis-associated genes cause ribosomopathies 
that compose a group of developmental disorders characterized 
by reduced  viability and  population  of erythroid  precursors, 
neural crest cells, or other tissue-speciﬁc cell types ( Zhou et al., 
2015 ; Calo et al., 2018 ) . Consistently, multiple mouse strains 
with increased p53 activity due to conventional or conditional 
inactivation of Mdm2 and/or Mdmx, which encode two master 
inhibitors of p53, display diverse developmental defects ( Bowen 
and Attardi, 2019 ) . The pro-apoptotic function of p53 was ﬁrst 
described by the Oren group in 1991 ( Yonish-Rouach et al., 
1991 ) , which was validated later in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts 
( MEFs ) ( Lowe et al., 1993 ) and cancer cells ( Aubrey et al., 2018 ) 
and will be further discussed below ( Figure 1 ) . Recently, we have 
identiﬁed a new target gene of p53, SEPT4 / ARTS , which encodes 
a pro-apoptotic protein that directly binds to p53 and enhances 
the interaction between p53 and BCL-X L at the mitochondria, 
resulting in augmented apoptosis ( Hao et al., 2021a ) . In this 
review, we illustrate the mechanisms underlying p53 regulation 
of apoptosis, provide an updated overview of the function of

apoptosis-related protein in TGF- β signaling pathway ( ARTS ) as a 
critical component of the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway, and 
discuss the clinical relevance of ARTS in cancer and non-cancer 
diseases. 

p53-dependent transcriptional regulation of the BCL-2 family 
genes 

(cid:2) -RRRCWWGYYY-3 

p53’s function is mainly executed through its transcriptional 
activity, because it can induce or repress gene expression by 
binding to the responsive elements ( REs ) on gene promoters. A 
typical RE sequence is degenerate and composed of two ‘half- 
(cid:2) , which are separated by a spacer of 
sites’, 5 
0–21 base pairs ( Riley et al., 2008 ) . NOXA was the ﬁrst BH3- 
only gene identiﬁed as a direct transcriptional target of p53 ( Oda 
et al., 2000 ) . The expression of Noxa was found to be upregu- 
lated by X-ray irradiation in MEFs and thymocytes but not in p53- 
−/ −) murine cells. After induction, Noxa translo- 
deﬁcient ( p53 
cates to the mitochondria and interacts with the anti-apoptotic 
BCL-2 members, leading to caspase-9 activation and apoptosis. 
Depletion of Noxa renders signiﬁcant resistance of MEFs to DNA 
damage-induced and p53-mediated apoptosis ( Shibue et al., 
2003 ) . PUMA , also known as BBC3 , was later found to be another 
BH3-only gene critical for p53-induced apoptosis by three inde- 
pendent groups ( Han et al., 2001 ; Nakano and Vousden, 2001 ; 
Yu et al., 2001 ) . PUMA binds to and inhibits BCL-2 and BCL-X L at 
the mitochondria, consequently leading to cytochrome c release 
and APAF1-dependent apoptosis ( Han et al., 2001 ; Nakano and 
Vousden, 2001 ; Yu et al., 2001 ) . Genetic studies using Noxa or 
Puma knockout mice revealed that Puma acts as a more powerful 
mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis, as only loss of Puma can 
protect lymphocytes and hematopoietic cells from apoptosis 
induced by DNA damage stress ( Jeﬀers et al., 2003 ; Villunger 
et al., 2003 ) . Another study using combined knockout mouse 
models demonstrated that, although both Noxa and Puma are 
required for p53-induced apoptosis in murine ﬁbroblasts and 
thymocytes, Puma has a predominant pro-apoptotic function in 
many other cell types ( Michalak et al., 2008 ) . Consistently, p53- 
dependent PUMA induction leads to chemotherapy-induced in- 
testinal injury, while inhibition of PUMA protects intestinal stem 
cells against apoptosis ( Leibowitz et al., 2018 ) . The critical role 
of PUMA in p53-mediated apoptosis may be also reﬂected by 
the fact that the pseudo-caspase FLIP ( L ) suppresses apoptosis 
by selectively inhibiting p53 induction of PUMA , but not other 
pro-apoptotic target genes, such as NOXA and BAX ( Lees et al., 
2020 ) . An exception is that loss of Noxa can inhibit UV radiation- 
induced apoptosis in murine ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes more 
dramatically than loss of Puma ( Naik et al., 2007 ) , suggesting 
that NOXA and PUMA may coordinate with each other to regu- 
late apoptosis in the context of diﬀerent cell types and cellular 
stresses ( El-Saaﬁn et al., 2022 ) . These two BH3-only proteins 
are both critically important to p53-induced apoptosis, because 
their combined depletion can prevent murine cells from apopto- 
sis as eﬀectively as knockout of p53 ( Michalak et al., 2008 ) . 

Besides 

two  pro-apoptotic  genes,  p53  can 
transcriptionally induce more BH3-only genes, including BID 

these 

( Sax et al., 2002 ) , BIK ( Mathai et al., 2002 ) , and BAD ( Jiang et al., 
2006 ) . BIM was initially considered an indirect p53 target gene, 
as its expression could only be induced after 6 h treatment of 
etoposide, which was much later than the induction of PUMA 
and  NOXA  ( Happo  et  al.,  2010 ) .  However,  a  later  study 
suggested  that  p53  may  directly  regulate  BIM  expression 
via  a  potential  p53-RE  on  its  promoter  region  through  a 
genome-wide  analysis  ( Kenzelmann  Broz  et  al.,  2013 ) .  BMF 
could  be  upregulated  by  acetylated  p53,  as  IFN- γ-mediated 
HDAC1 deacetylation of p53 leads to reduced expression of 
BMF ( Contreras et al., 2013 ) . We recently found that the E3 
ubiquitin  ligase  FBXW7  promotes  proteolytic  degradation  of 
the  m 6 A-binding  protein  YTHDF2,  leading  to  stabilization  of 
m 6 A-modiﬁed  BMF  mRNA  ( Xu  et  al.,  2021 ) .  Given  that  p53 
transcriptionally  activates  FBXW7  expression  ( Mao  et  al., 
2004 ;  Perez-Losada  et  al.,  2005 ) ,  our  study  implies  that 
BMF may be an indirect target gene of p53. In addition, p53 
represses  the  transcription  of  the  anti-apoptotic  members, 
BCL-2 ,  BCL-X L ,  and  MCL1 ,  through  indirect  mechanisms 
( Miyashita  et  al.,  1994 ;  Sugars  et  al.,  2001 ;  Pietrzak  and 
Puzianowska-Kuznicka, 2008 ; Aubrey et al., 2022 ) . Collectively, 
p53 can promote mitochondrial apoptosis by either activating 
the  expression  of  the  pro-apoptotic  BCL-2  family  genes  or 
inhibiting the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes. 

Inhibition of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins leads to the 
activation of the pore-forming proteins, BAX and BAK, which 
is a prerequisite for MOMP and the release of cytochrome c 
( Oltvai et al., 1993 ; Chittenden et al., 1995 ; Farrow et al., 1995 ; 
Kiefer et al., 1995 ) . BCL-2 and BCL-X L inactivate the pore-forming 
proteins by forming heterodimers with the latter ( Yin et al., 1994 ; 
Farrow et al., 1995 ) . When cells are under apoptotic stimulation, 
however, the BH3-only proteins bind to BAX and BAK to facilitate 
their homo-oligomerization, leading to the pore formation at the 
mitochondrial outer membrane and consequent cytochrome c 
release ( Czabotar et al., 2013 ) . Interestingly, a putative p53-RE 
was found on the BAX gene promoter, which was responsible 
for BAX transcription upon genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent 
fashion ( Miyashita et al., 1994 ; Selvakumaran et al., 1994 ; 
Zhan et al., 1994 ; Miyashita and Reed, 1995 ) . Recently, we 
unveiled an additional mechanism accounting for p53-induced 
BAX transcription ( Liao et al., 2016 ) . The transcription elonga- 
tion factor TFIIS.h, which is encoded by the TCEA3 gene that is 
transcriptionally induced by p53, speciﬁcally associates with the 
genomic DNA and the transcripts of BAX , thereby enhancing its 
transcription ( Liao et al., 2016 ) . Thus, p53 can induce BAX mRNA 
expression by activating its transcription initiation and enhanc- 
ing its transcription elongation via distinct mechanisms. Finally, 
p53 transcriptionally activates the APAF1-encoding gene, whose 
protein product can serve as a scaﬀold for apoptosome assem- 
bly and caspase activation ( Soengas et al., 1999 ; Fortin et al., 
2001 ; Kannan et al., 2001 ; Moroni et al., 2001 ; Robles et al., 
2001 ) . Taken together, these studies demonstrate that p53 can 
regulate the expression of a wide range of genes involved in 
the multistep mitochondrial apoptosis, including activation of 
pro-apoptotic and inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins,

MOMP,  cytochrome  c  release,  apoptosome  assembly,  and 
caspase activation ( Figure 1 ) . 

Regulation of the BCL-2 family proteins by cytosolic p53 

The transcription-independent pro-apoptotic activity of p53 
was ﬁrst described in the middle of the 1990s, as evidenced 
by the fact that several p53 mutants with deﬁciencies in tran- 
scription activity could still trigger apoptosis ( Caelles et al., 
1994 ; Haupt et al., 1995 ) . Stress-activated p53 was found to 
translocate to the mitochondria, thereby eliciting cytochrome c 
release and caspase activation in both primary and cancer cells 
( Marchenko et al., 2000 ; Mihara et al., 2003 ) . Mechanistically, 
mitochondrial p53, like many other BH3-only proteins, can form 
complexes with and, as such, inhibit the apoptotic antagonists, 
BCL-2 and BCL-X L ( Mihara et al., 2003 ; Wei et al., 2021 ) . This 
action may be facilitated by the MDM2 homolog, MDMX, as 
it promotes the translocation of cytoplasmic p53 to the mito- 
chondria and enhances p53 interaction with BCL-2 ( Mancini 
et al., 2009 ) . Interestingly, the polymorphic variants of p53 were 
shown to have distinct accessibility to the mitochondria—the 
arginine-72 variant of p53 exhibits greater potential to trigger 
cytochrome c release than the proline-72 variant ( Dumont et al., 
2003 ; Almeida et al., 2021 ) . Conversely, overexpression of the 
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members can inhibit p53-induced apopto- 
sis as well ( Strasser et al., 1994 ; Chipuk et al., 2005 ) . BCL-X L was 
found to bind to the DNA-binding domain ( DBD ) of p53 ( Follis 
et al., 2014 ) and block cytoplasmic p53 from triggering apop- 
tosis upon inhibition of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism, which 
leads to an eﬀective combination therapy by targeting EGFR and 
pharmacologically stabilizing p53 ( Mai et al., 2017 ) . In addition, 
p53 directly binds to and activates the pore-forming protein, 
BAX, and depletion of BAX completely abrogates cytoplasmic 
p53-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and MEFs ( Chipuk et al., 
2003 , 2004 ) . p53 was also found to promote the translocation 
of BAX from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria through their 
direct interaction ( Dubrez et al., 2001 ; Schuler et al., 2003 ) . A 
later study showed that cis–trans isomerization of proline 47 
within the p53 protein catalyzed by the prolyl isomerase PIN1 
is required for BAX activation ( Follis et al., 2015 ) . Another pore- 
forming protein, BAK, is also critical for the pro-apoptotic func- 
tion of cytoplasmic p53. p53 interacts with BAK at the mitochon- 
dria to facilitate homo-oligomerization of the latter through per- 
turbation of the MCL1/BAK interaction, resulting in MOMP and 
cytochrome c release ( Leu et al., 2004 ) , while TRAF6-mediated 
p53 ubiquitination prevents its mitochondrial translocation and 
the interaction between p53 and MCL1/BAK ( Zhang et al., 2016 ) . 
Additionally, p53 can mediate the proteasomal degradation of 
MCL1, though the underlying mechanism is not well understood. 
Activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor, RG7388, modulates 
phosphorylation of MCL1 and promotes its proteasomal degra- 
dation, thus overcoming apoptosis resistance of acute myeloid 
leukemia ( Pan et al., 2017 ) . Recently, p53 was also found to 
promote  MCL1  degradation,  resulting  in  the  release  of  BAK 
and induction of apoptosis, in MYC-driven B-cell lymphomas 
( Domostegui et al., 2021 ) . An interesting observation is that 

cancer-associated mutations in the DBD of p53 impair the pro- 
apoptotic activity of cytoplasmic p53 ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) , as 
they disrupt the interactions of BCL-X L and MCL1 with p53’s DBD 
( Mihara et al., 2003 ; Leu et al., 2004 ; Pietsch et al., 2008 ) . 
Together, cytoplasmic p53 participates in mitochondrial apop- 
tosis by physically interacting with and regulating BCL-2 family 
proteins ( Figure 1 ) . 

The role of ARTS in promoting mitochondrial apoptosis 

ARTS protein, encoded by an alternative spliced variant of the 
SEPT4 gene, is located at the outer membrane of the mitochon- 
dria ( Figure 2 ; Larisch et al., 2000 ; Mandel-Gutfreund et al., 
2011 ) .  ARTS  was  originally  identiﬁed  as  a  TGF- β-responsive 
protein  by  retroviral  insertional  mutagenesis  screening,  be- 
cause overexpression of ARTS enhanced, whereas depletion of 
ARTS inhibited, TGF- β-induced caspase activation and apoptosis 
( Larisch et al., 2000 ) . Later studies showed that ARTS can also 
be activated by a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli, including 
staurosporine, arabinoside, 5-azacytidine, etoposide, and UV 
irradiation ( Elhasid et al., 2004 ; Gottfried et al., 2004 ; Edison 
et  al.,  2012b ) .  One  of  the  mechanisms  underlying  the  pro- 
apopt otic activity of ARTS is through inhibition of XIAP ( Gottfried 
et al., 2004 ) . Upon pro-apoptotic stimuli, a portion of ARTS 
molecules are released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, 
where they bind to the BIR1 and BIR3 domains of XIAP ( Gottfried 
et al., 2004 ; Bornstein et al., 2011 ) . Also, ARTS binds to and 
recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1 to promote ubiquitination 
and degradation of XIAP ( Garrison et al., 2011 ) . The translo- 
cation of ARTS to the cytoplasm precedes the release of cy- 
tochrome c and SMAC, which is therefore considered a critical 
step for apoptosis initiation ( Edison et al., 2012b ) . Recently, 
ARTS was found to directly associate with the BH3 domain of 
BCL-2 and promote XIAP-induced BCL-2 proteasomal degrada- 
tion ( Edison et al., 2017 ) . The physiological function of ARTS has 
also been extensively studied in multiple genetic mouse mod- 
els, demonstrating that this apoptosis inducer plays essential 
roles in spermatogenesis, development of hematopoietic and 
intestinal stem cells, and skin regeneration ( Kissel et al., 2005 ; 
Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2010 ; Fuchs et al., 2013 ; Koren et al., 
2018 ) . ARTS expression is controlled by surveillance mecha- 
nisms that maintain a low level of ARTS to support cell survival, 
while the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ARTS is repressed 
when cells are under pro-apoptotic stimuli or DNA damage stress 
( Lotan et al., 2005 ) . The apoptosis inhibitor, XIAP, which is re- 
pressed and degraded by ARTS ( Gottfried et al., 2004 ; Bornstein 
et al., 2011 ; Garrison et al., 2011 ) , was identiﬁed as an E3 
ubiquitin ligase targeting ARTS for proteasomal degradation, 
thus forming a negative feedback circuit ( Bornstein et al., 2012 ) . 
In addition, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, which is encoded by 
the Parkinson’s disease-associated gene, PRKN , was found to 
promote ARTS ubiquitination and degradation in neuronal cells 
and rat brains ( Kemeny et al., 2012 ) . This ﬁnding may partially 
explain why mutations of PRKN result in neuronal cell death and 
neurodegeneration.

Figure 2 The role of ARTS in promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. ARTS is encoded by a p53-target gene whose expression is responsive to 
diverse apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA damage stress and TGF- β activation. There are three mechanisms for ARTS-induced mitochondrial 
apoptosis: ( i ) ARTS facilitates the mitochondrial localization of p53 and enhances the p53–BCL-X L interaction at the mitochondria; ( ii ) ARTS 
suppresses XIAP and promotes its proteasomal degradation by recruiting SIAH1 as a ternary complex; and ( iii ) ARTS bridges BCL-2 and XIAP 
by directly binding to them, allowing for XIAP-mediated proteasomal degradation of BCL-2. 

Recently, we identiﬁed SEPT4/ARTS as a p53-responsive gene 
that plays a critical role in p53-dependent mitochondrial apop- 
tosis ( Figure  2 ;  Hao  et al.,  2021a ) .  To  elucidate  the  tumor- 
suppressive functions of p53, we performed a microarray anal- 
ysis to screen the signiﬁcant diﬀerentially expressed genes in 
colon cancer HCT116 cells treated with or without the p53- 
inducing agent, Inauhzin ( Liao et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ) . 
This screening led to the identiﬁcation of several important 
transcriptional target genes of p53, such as NGFR ( Zhou et al., 
2016 ) , PHLDB3 ( Chao et al., 2016 ) , TCEA3 ( Liao et al., 2016 ) , 
and SEPT4 / ARTS ( Hao et al., 2021a ) . To support this, treatment 
of cancer cells with various p53-inducing agents, including cis- 
platin, doxorubicin, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and Nutlin-3, or overexpres- 
sion of p53 in cancer cells, resulted in the increase of both 
mRNA  and  protein  levels of ARTS.  Additionally,  γ-irradiation 
dramatically boosted Sept4 / Arts expression in thymuses and 
−/ −, mice. Importantly, a p53-RE 
spleens of p53 
at −2279 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site was 
validated through the luciferase reporter assay and the chro- 
matin IP assay, demonstrating SEPT4 / ARTS as a bona ﬁde p53 
target gene. Intriguingly, we accidentally found that mutant p53 
might bind to a peptide ( KLQDQALKE ) encoded by the SEPT4 
gene in ovarian cancer in another study ( Chen et al., 2019 ) . This 
prompted us to test whether wild-type p53 can also bind to ARTS, 
because both mutant and wild-type p53 share many common 
binding partners ( Hao et al., 2020 ) . Indeed, we further conﬁrmed 
that p53 interacts with ARTS in cancer cells and, more impor- 
tantly, at the mitochondria. Unlike NGFR ( Zhou et al., 2016 ) 

+ / + , but not p53 

and PHLDB3 ( Chao et al., 2016 ) , ARTS did not regulate p53 
protein stability, as enforced expression of ARTS failed to aﬀect 
the expression of exogenous and endogenous p53 in H1299 
and HCT116 cells, respectively. Instead, ARTS facilitated p53 
translocation to the mitochondria and increased the interaction 
of p53 with BCL-X L , consequently leading to inhibition of BCL-X L 
and augmented apoptosis. Remarkably, our study also revealed 
ARTS as a biomarker for tumor chemosensitivity, dependent on 
p53, because overexpression of ARTS enhanced, whereas deple- 
tion of ARTS impaired, chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in wild- 
type p53-harboring cancer cells ( Hao et al., 2021a ) . Together, 
our ﬁndings unveil ARTS as a new p53 target and partner in the 
p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. 

Relevance of ARTS in cancer and non-cancer diseases 

Since ARTS is an apoptosis inducer by antagonizing the anti- 
apopt otic pr ot eins,  s uch  as XIAP,  BCL-2,  and  BCL-X L ,  as de- 
scribed above ( Figure 2 ) , it might act as a tumor suppressor. 
Supporting this speculation are the following lines of evidence. 
First, ARTS was found to be underexpressed in lymphoblasts 
of > 70% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) pa- 
tients ( Elhasid et al., 2004 ) . This cancer-associated deﬁciency 
was  speciﬁc  to  the  ARTS isoform,  as  the  expression  of  H5, 
another variant encoded by SEPT4 , was not aﬀected, suggest- 
ing  that an  RNA  splicing  mechanism  might be  dysregulated 
in these patients. After treatment with chemotherapy, the lev- 
els  of  ARTS  in  lymphocytes  were  increased  by  2–30  folds, 
which was correlated with disease remission. Also, leukemic

cells lacking ARTS expression are resistant to chemotherapy- 
induced apoptosis. These ﬁndings support the idea that ARTS 
acts as both a tumor suppressor and a prognostic biomarker, 
at least, for ALL. The tumor-suppressive role of ARTS was fur- 
ther validated by a study using a Sept4 -deﬁcient mouse model 
( Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2010 ) . Deletion of Sept4 led to an in- 
creased number of hematopoietic stem cells or tumor-initiating 
cells, upregulation of XIAP, resistance to apoptosis, and, con- 
sequently,  accelerated  development  of  leukemias  and  lym- 
phomas. The ﬁndings suggest that ARTS mimetics or activators 
might serve as potential therapeutic agents for cancers with high 
levels of XIAP, BCL-2, or BCL-X L ( Shahar and Larisch, 2020 ) . The 
C-terminus of ARTS contains a unique 27-residue peptide, which 
is distinct from other known proteins ( Edison et al., 2012a ) . 
Subdivision of this peptide revealed that a 9-residue peptide is 
suﬃcient for binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP and inducing 
caspase activation and apoptosis. Recently, a candidate com- 
pound that mimics ARTS to speciﬁcally bind to XIAP was identi- 
ﬁed through a structure-based computational screen ( Mamriev 
et al., 2020 ) . The compound can induce apoptosis by promoting 
the degradation of both XIAP and BCL-2. In addition, loss of ARTS 
expression in leukemia is partially due to epigenetic silencing 
by DNA methylation ( Elhasid et al., 2004 ) . The methylation in- 
hibitor, 5-azacytidine, was shown to elevate the expression of 
ARTS in both leukemic cell lines and ALL patients. Furthermore, 
genotoxic agents or p53-inducing agents can induce the expres- 
sion of ARTS, consistent with our ﬁndings as described above 
( Hao et al., 2021a ) . It is thus speculated that the combination 
of methylation inhibitors, which remove DNA methylation from 
the SEPT4 / ARTS promoter, with genotoxic agents, which induce 
p53 activation ( Hao et al., 2021b ) , could be a more eﬀective 
approach for the treatment of cancers, such as leukemia, which 
sustain wild-type p53 and lower levels of ARTS, by inducing 
ARTS expression and ARTS-dependent apoptosis. Hence, further 
exploring this translational potential in the near future would be 
tremendously conducive to the development of a new strategy 
for anti-cancer therapies. 

In addition, ARTS induction may contribute to developmen- 
tal defects caused by aberrant p53 activation, as depletion of 
Sept4 / Arts promotes the development and renewal of several 
types of stem cells, including germinal, hematopoietic, and cu- 
taneous stem cells, by inhibiting apoptosis ( Kissel et al., 2005 ; 
Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2010 ; Fuchs et al., 2013 ) . Thus, the 
development of ARTS antagonists could be helpful for treating 
subsets of ribosomopathies that are caused by tissue-speciﬁc 
activation of p53 ( Zhou et al., 2015 ; Calo et al., 2018 ) . An- 
other possible clinical application of ARTS inhibition might pre- 
vent intestinal injury triggered by cancer chemotherapies. Most 
chemotherapeutic agents can cause intestinal dysfunction or 
enterotoxicity that is associated with intestinal crypt apoptosis 
( Leibowitz et al., 2018 ) . Since knockout of Sept4 / Arts promotes 
+ intestinal stem cells and thus the regenera- 
the renewal of Lgr5 
tion of crypts ( Koren et al., 2018 ) , targeting intestinal ARTS could 
be a promising strategy for alleviating normal intestinal damage 
without aﬀecting the pro-apoptotic activity of p53 in cancer cells.
