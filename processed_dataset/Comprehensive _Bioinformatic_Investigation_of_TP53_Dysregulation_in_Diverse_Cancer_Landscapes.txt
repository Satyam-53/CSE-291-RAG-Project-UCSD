Abstract: P53 overexpression plays a critical role in cancer pathogenesis by disrupting the intricate
regulation of cellular proliferation. Despite its firmly established function as a tumor suppressor,
elevated p53 levels can paradoxically contribute to tumorigenesis, influenced by factors such as
exposure to carcinogens, genetic mutations, and viral infections. This phenomenon is observed across
a spectrum of cancer types, including bladder (BLCA), ovarian (OV), cervical (CESC), cholangiocarci-
noma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), esophageal
carcinoma (ESCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney chromophobe (KICH),
kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarci-
noma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma
(UCEC). This broad spectrum of cancers is often associated with increased aggressiveness and re-
currence risk. Effective therapeutic strategies targeting tumors with p53 overexpression require a
comprehensive approach, integrating targeted interventions aimed at the p53 gene with conventional
modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted drugs. In this extensive study, we
present a detailed analysis shedding light on the multifaceted role of TP53 across various cancers,
with a specific emphasis on its impact on disease-free survival (DFS). Leveraging data from the
TCGA database and the GTEx dataset, along with GEPIA, UALCAN, and STRING, we identify TP53
overexpression as a significant prognostic indicator, notably pronounced in prostate adenocarcinoma
(PRAD). Supported by compelling statistical significance (p < 0.05), our analysis reveals the distinct
influence of TP53 overexpression on DFS outcomes in PRAD. Additionally, graphical representations
of overall survival (OS) underscore the notable disparity in OS duration between tumors exhibiting
elevated TP53 expression (depicted by the red line) and those with lower TP53 levels (indicated by
the blue line). The hazard ratio (HR) further emphasizes the profound impact of TP53 on overall
survival. Moreover, our investigation delves into the intricate TP53 protein network, unveiling genes
exhibiting robust positive correlations with TP53 expression across 13 out of 27 cancers. Remarkably,
negative correlations emerge with pivotal tumor suppressor genes. This network analysis elucidates
critical proteins, including SIRT1, CBP, p300, ATM, DAXX, HSP 90-alpha, Mdm2, RPA70, 14-3-3
protein sigma, p53, and ASPP2, pivotal in regulating cell cycle dynamics, DNA damage response,
and transcriptional regulation. Our study underscores the paramount importance of deciphering
TP53 dynamics in cancer, providing invaluable insights into tumor behavior, disease-free survival,
and potential therapeutic avenues.

metabolic stress, oncogene activation, and damage to DNA. By regulating several processes
like cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis, p53 upholds genomic stability
through its diverse regulatory roles [1–3]. All of these processes work together to provide a
strong defense against malignant transformation.

The crucial function of p53 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its significant
consequences for the biology of cancer has been clarified by extensive research efforts.
Significant research has revealed how the pathophysiology of many human malignancies
is largely driven by the dysregulation of p53 activity, which is frequently triggered by
TP53 gene mutations.
Investigative pioneers Vogelstein, Minna, and associates [4–6]
discovered the regular occurrence of extensive TP53 mutation databases [7–10], which
provide additional confirmation of TP53 mutations in cancer.

These mutations, which are primarily found in the p53’s core DNA binding domain,
cause the tumor suppressor protein to lose its function [1,11], which causes unchecked
cell division, genomic instability, and the development of cancer. Interestingly, some mis-
sense mutations worsen tumorigenic processes by inhibiting wild-type p53 in a dominant-
negative manner or by acquiring the characteristics of an oncogenic gain-of-function.

Moreover, abnormal p53 expression or activity has become a marker for aggressive
tumor behavior, resistance to treatment, and poor clinical results in a wide range of cancer
types, including gastrointestinal disorders, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical and
breast cancers, and others. This correlation highlights the complex relationship between
p53 dysregulation and the advancement of cancer, hence requiring thorough research into
the molecular mechanisms driving p53 malfunction.

Comprehending the complexities of p53 dysregulation has important therapeutic
ramifications since it opens the door to the creation of focused therapies meant to restore
p53 function and lessen the deleterious effects of cancer. Additionally, using integrated
methods like The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) provides a comprehensive
understanding of the dynamics of TP53 mutations in a variety of cancer types, making it
easier to identify new therapeutic targets and prognostic markers that will enhance patient
outcomes and clinical management.

2. Introduction

Cancer represents a complex biological phenomenon characterized by dysregulated
cell growth and survival [12]. Due to its biological roles, the p53 tumor suppressor is
not only an important protector against malignant transformation but may also be used
as a prognostic marker in cancer research [12]. As a transcription factor, p53 controls
the growth of normal cells by coordinating the expression of genes that either promote
cell cycle progression or cause cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, especially in cases when
the genome is damaged [13]. Furthermore, in response to DNA damage, active p53
is essential for inducing apoptosis in cells that have reached a growth halt [14]. This
process is particularly effective when carcinogenic triggers are present. Recent studies have
illuminated the intriguingly complex dynamics of p53 signaling, revealing not only its
protective role in normal cells but also its paradoxical contributions to cancer pathogenesis
when dysregulated. In cancer, TP53 is often mutated or expressed at abnormally high
levels, altering p53’s normal regulatory functions and contributing to tumor progression
and aggressiveness.

This dichotomy is apparent in a wide range of cancers, such as prostate adenocar-
cinoma, childhood malignant gliomas [15], endometrial carcinoma [16], and laryngeal
squamous cell carcinoma [17], where overexpression of TP53 often predicts adverse out-
comes. In these cancers, the status of TP53 is closely linked with disease progression and
significantly affects patient outcomes. Moreover, theoretical models [18,19] have proposed
that the dynamics of p53 in response to DNA damage, such as the oscillatory behavior
driven by transcriptional and translational delays, are crucial for effective DNA repair.
These models offer a potential window into manipulating p53 pathways therapeutically to
balance its tumor-suppressing capabilities against its role in cancer promotion.

The fact that p53 is frequently mutated in around 50% of human malignancies indi-
cates that p53 plays an important role in triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis progres-
sion [20–22]. When cells experience DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs)
brought on by ionizing radiation (IR) and other pharmaceutical agents, the p53 regulatory
network is triggered. This arrests the cell cycle, allowing the cell to repair any damage,
trigger transcription of a gene indirectly involved in DNA repair, and trigger apoptosis to
eliminate irreversibly damaged cells [21,23,24]. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [25] suggested
that the quantity of p53 pulses could predict a cell’s fate—whether it survives or dies.
Additionally, Chen et al. [26] and Purvis et al. [27] suggested that p53 dynamics govern
the DNA damage response, deciding a cell’s fate between life and death. These indicate
that the development of cell control techniques requires a profound understanding of the
dynamics of the p53 regulatory network in the DNA damage response.

The significance of p53 in cellular responses to genotoxic stimuli is highlighted
by evidence suggesting that intact p53 can trigger apoptosis after exposure to ionizing
radiation [28]. In contrast, p53 function loss has been reported linked to increased cellular
resistance to a range of chemotherapeutic drugs, highlighting its function in regulating
therapeutic responses during cancer treatment.

Gaining knowledge about the complex roles played by p53 might help us better
understand cancer biology and may make it possible to use p53 status as a predictor [29]of
treatment response and patient outcomes. This emphasizes how crucial it is to thoroughly
examine TP53 mutations and the networks of interactions they have with other cancer
types to understand the complex molecular mechanisms driving the development of cancer
and to spot possible therapeutic weaknesses.

Although tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the molec-
ular causes of cancer, a substantial knowledge gap remains with regard to the thorough
examination of TP53 mutations and the networks of interactions they entail in a variety
of human malignancies. By using cutting-edge bioinformatic techniques to decipher the
complex terrain of p53 changes across various cancer types, this study aims to close this gap.
utilizing state-of-the-art instruments like GEPIA [30], UALCAN [31], and STRING [32], we
aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying p53 dysregulation in cancer and
identify novel therapeutic opportunities for personalized cancer management.

Prior research has established TP53 as one of the most frequently mutated genes in
human cancers, with alterations in p53 function implicated in the initiation and progres-
sion of various malignancies. Furthermore, studies have consistently demonstrated an
association between TP53 mutations and adverse clinical outcomes, including increased
tumor aggressiveness and reduced patient survival [33–35]. However, despite this wealth
of evidence, our understanding of the comprehensive landscape of TP53 mutations and
their functional consequences across diverse cancer types remains incomplete.

While individual studies have provided valuable insights into the role of TP53 mu-
tations in specific cancer contexts, a holistic analysis of TP53 alterations across a broad
spectrum of human cancers is lacking. This knowledge gap represents a significant barrier
to fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression and limits the
development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting p53 dysregulation. By conducting
a comprehensive bioinformatic exploration of TP53 dynamics in diverse cancer landscapes,
we aim to fill this critical void and uncover novel insights into the pathogenesis of cancer.
The lack of a comprehensive analysis of TP53 mutations and their associated interac-
tion networks across various cancer types hinders our ability to decipher the molecular
intricacies underlying cancer progression and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.
This knowledge deficit poses a significant challenge to the development of personalized
cancer therapies tailored to the unique genetic and molecular characteristics of individ-
ual patients.

This study aims to conduct an exhaustive bioinformatic analysis of TP53 mutations
and their related interaction networks across multiple human cancers, utilizing data and
tools such as GEPIA [30], UALCAN [31], and STRING [32]. We hypothesize that a com-

Genes 2024, 15, 577

prehensive exploration of TP53 dynamics in diverse cancer landscapes will unveil novel
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, identify potential therapeutic targets, and deepen
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cancer development and progres-
sion. Statement of the problem: The lack of a comprehensive analysis of TP53 mutations
and their associated interaction networks across various cancer types poses a formidable
challenge to deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving cancer development and pro-
gression. This knowledge gap impedes the identification of potential therapeutic targets
and undermines efforts to develop personalized cancer therapies customized to the unique
characteristics of individual patients.

3.2. Analysis of TP53 Expression across Diverse Cancer Types

We examined TP53 expression in 27 different types of human tumors, representing
a broad range of cancers. We conducted a thorough comparison of the TP53 expression
levels in tumor tissues, comparable to normal tissues, and GTEx database data by utilizing
the GEPIA online server. Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC), Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
(BLCA), Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCA), Glioblastoma
Multiforme (GBM), Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC), Kidney Chro-
mophobe (KICH), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), Kidney Renal Papillary
Cell Carcinoma (KIRP), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML), Brain Lower Grade Glioma

noma (THCA), Thymoma (THYM), and Uterine Carcinosarcoma (UCS). The analysis did
not include tumor forms with small sample sizes or without samples of normal tissue. Our
statistical strategy included comparing comparable normal tissues, using log2(TPM + 1)
transformed expression data, applying the ANOVA method to guarantee the robustness
and dependability of our results for differential gene expression analysis, setting a strict
q-value threshold of 0.01 and a | log 2FC| threshold of 1.

3.3. Exploring Survival Dynamics

We examined TP53 expression-related survival outcomes in addition to assessing
gene expression patterns. We examined overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
(DFS) results for different forms of cancer using the GEPIA web server. We determined
hazard ratios (HR) using the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model and the Log-rank
test to evaluate the effect of TP53 expression levels on patient survival. We thoroughly

Genes 2024, 15, 577

examined the differences in survival between high-expression and low-expression groups
by stratifying patients based on a TP53 expression threshold of 50%. This allowed us to
gain important insights into the prognostic importance of TP53 in various cancers.

3.4. Analyzing Gene Correlations: TP53’s Correlation Investigation

We explored the complex field of gene correlations, specifically aiming to clarify the
connections between TP53 and various gene sets in various cancer types. Using paired
examination of gene expression data obtained from the TCGA and GTEx databases, we
clarified the extent and orientation of these correlations. Classified correlation coefficients
provided insightful information on the TP53 network, allowing for the identification of
genes that showed substantial correlations in each of the 27 cancer types and the fine-
grained analysis of individual cancer subtypes. A greater comprehension of the molecular
connections and regulatory mechanisms involving TP53 in the pathophysiology of cancer
was made possible by this all-encompassing approach.

3.5. Constructing the TP53 Protein Network

By utilizing the STRING database to investigate functional protein association net-
works, our methodological framework resulted in the creation of the TP53 protein network.
The network study included genes that showed substantial associations with TP53, as
determined by the GEPIA web server. Important tumor suppressor proteins like ATR,
ATM, BUB1B, BRCA1/2, CHK2, and CYLD were included in this extensive network, which
provided insight into possible protein–protein interactions within the TP53 network. Our
analysis untangled the complex network of molecular interactions, offering important new
understandings of the functional consequences of TP53 dysregulation in cancer biology.

In conclusion, our methodology allowed for a thorough investigation of the critical
function that TP53 plays in the pathophysiology of cancer, revealing the nuances of protein
interactions, survival dynamics, and gene expression within complex cancer biology.

4. Results
4.1. Unraveling the Impact of P53 Overexpression in Tumors

P53, a pivotal tumor suppressor gene, orchestrates the delicate balance of the cell
cycle, curbing uncontrolled cell division. However, elevated p53 expression can tip the
scales, fostering the development and aggressive growth of tumors. This phenomenon
is attributed to various factors, including exposure to carcinogens, genetic mutations, or
viral infections. The scope of p53 overexpression extends across a spectrum of cancers,
encompassing bladder, ovarian, cervical, lung, and breast cancers. Notably, heightened p53
expression is associated with more aggressive cancers, carrying a higher risk of recurrence.
Treatment strategies for tumors exhibiting p53 overexpression often involve a multifaceted
approach, combining targeted therapies directed at the p53 gene with chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and targeted drug therapies.

4.2. Mapping P53’s Journey through Pathological Stages

P53’s influence transcends through five distinct pathological stages, each categorized
based on p53 expression levels within tumors. Stage I exhibits minimal p53 expression,
while stage V presents the highest levels. Tumors with heightened p53 expression often
manifest malignant characteristics, carrying a poorer prognosis. Therapeutic approaches
for such cases involve targeted therapies directed at the p53 gene, complemented by
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted drug therapies.

4.3. Decoding P53 Subtypes

P53 manifests in four distinct subtypes, shaped by genetic mutations or alterations:
wild-type, mutant, overexpressed, and deleted. The wild-type represents the normal
gene form, while mutant, overexpressed, and deleted forms signify genetic deviations.
Each subtype aligns with different cancer types, warranting tailored treatment strategies.
For instance, mutant p53 is associated with specific lung cancers, suggesting targeted
therapies as potential interventions. Overexpressed p53, linked to certain breast cancers,
may find remediation through a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted
drug therapies.

Unraveling TP53 Gene and Biological Pathways

In our investigation, we delved into the biological pathways connected to the TP53
gene, commonly known as the p53 gene—a pivotal regulator governing diverse cellular
processes. These pathways were unearthed through the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes) database, offering profound insights into how TP53 influences various
facets of cell biology and its implications for cancer.

•

•

•

p53 Signaling Pathway (hsa04115): Central to TP53’s function, this pathway involves
crucial proteins such as p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP22 (PERP) and Tumor
protein p53 inducible protein 11 (TP53I11), pivotal in mediating TP53’s impact on cell
survival, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
Endocrine Resistance (hsa01522): Unveiling a connection between TP53 and cy-
tochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D member 6, our study suggests a potential role for
TP53 in endocrine resistance, particularly within the context of cancer therapy.
Platinum Drug Resistance (hsa01524): Our findings shed light on TP53’s involvement
in platinum drug resistance, a formidable challenge in cancer treatment. Proteins like
ERCC1, MLH1, MSH2, and GSTP1 play pivotal roles in this resistance mechanism.

•

• MAPK Signaling Pathway (hsa04010): TP53 appears to engage with proteins associ-
ated with the MAPK signaling pathway, regulating cell growth and differentiation.
This interaction hints at a broader role for TP53 in cellular responses to external signals.
Ras Signaling Pathway (hsa04014): Within this pathway, TP53 interacts with proteins
such as RAS, RAF, and MEK, suggesting its potential involvement in the regulation of
cell proliferation and growth, particularly in the context of cancer.
Cell Cycle (hsa04110): Our exploration supports the well-established role of TP53 in
governing the cell cycle. Proteins like BUB1B, BUBR1, MAD3L, and others contribute
to TP53-mediated control across various phases of the cell cycle.
PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway (hsa04151): TP53’s participation in the PI3K-Akt signal-
ing pathway implies its role in cell survival and proliferation, potentially influencing
cancer progression.

•

•

• Apoptosis (hsa04210): Recognized for its critical role in apoptosis, TP53’s association
with proteins in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway enhances our understanding of how
TP53 regulates programmed cell death.

Pathways in Cancer (hsa05200): TP53’s involvement in diverse signaling cascades,
including EGF-EGFR-RAS-ERK, underscores its significance in the development and
progression of cancer. These pathways offer a comprehensive view of TP53’s contribu-
tions to cancer-related processes.
Ferroptosis (hsa04216): Our investigation suggests that TP53 may influence ferropto-
sis, a regulated cell death process, adding to our comprehension of TP53’s role in cell
fate decisions.
Cellular Senescence (hsa04218): TP53’s presence in the cellular senescence pathway
highlights its role in driving cells into a state of irreversible growth arrest—an essential
mechanism to prevent uncontrolled cell division.

• Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis (hsa04120): TP53’s association with proteins like
BRCA1, CDC20, UBE2C, and UBE2S underscores its involvement in protein degrada-
tion, providing insights into how TP53 regulates the turnover of key cellular proteins.

These findings collectively unveil the multifaceted regulatory role of TP53 across
diverse cellular processes and its pervasive engagement in the pathways associated with
cancer. Comprehending these intricate connections provides valuable insights into the
intricate biology of TP53, unraveling its implications in the realms of cancer development,
drug resistance, and other nuanced cellular responses.

In the realm of advanced oncology, our investigation delved into the nuanced role of
TP53 overexpression in shaping cancer prognosis, employing meticulous analysis of The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data across various tumor types. The study aimed to unravel
the intricate relationships between TP53 gene expression levels and clinical outcomes.

TP53 Overexpression and Overall Survival (OS): Elevated expression of TP53 has been
identified as a significant determinant affecting overall survival in specific malignancies.
Patients exhibiting heightened TP53 levels experienced notably shorter overall survival
(OS) and a substantially unfavorable prognosis in cancers such as BRCA, LGG, LUAD,
PRAD, COAD, and SKCM (refer to Figures 3a–c and 4a). The statistical significance of
these associations (p-value < 0.05) underscores the central role of TP53 in influencing the

Genes 2024, 15, 577

clinical outcomes of these cancers. Detailed analyses of other malignancies with p-values
above 0.05 are provided in the Supplementary File for further exploration.

TP53 Overexpression and Disease-Free Survival (DFS): Furthermore, our investigation
extended to disease-free survival (DFS), uncovering TP53 overexpression as a predictor
of poorer prognoses, notably observed in PRAD (refer to Figure 4b). This unique yet com-
pelling finding, bolstered by significant changes (p-value < 0.05), underscores the distinct
impact of TP53 overexpression on DFS outcomes in prostate cancer. Detailed analyses of
DFS for other cancers with p-values above 0.05 are available in the Supplementary File for
comprehensive exploration.

Broad Impact Across Tumor Types: TP53 overexpression has demonstrated a profound
impact on overall survival across various tumor types. Patients with heightened TP53
expression experienced significantly shorter overall survival and notably unfavorable
prognoses in cancers including BLCA, BRCA, CESC, CHOL, COAD, DLBC, ESCA, HNSC,
KICH, KIRC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, UCEC and a few others, as mentioned above (refer to
Figures 5–14). The significance of these findings (p-value < 0.05) underscores the adverse
clinical implications associated with TP53 overexpression across a diverse spectrum of
cancer types. Specifically, we have focused on individual stages within each cancer where
the p-value is either equal to or below 0.05. Additionally, for each figure a corresponding
table has been included, featuring only those comparisons between normal versus stages
or stages versus stages that meet our specified criteria.

In essence, our study sheds light on the multifaceted impact of TP53 overexpression on
survival outcomes, emphasizing its role as a critical determinant in the clinical trajectory of
specific cancers. These findings contribute valuable insights to the broader understanding
of TP53-associated prognostic implications in oncology.

The graphical representations in overall survival analysis figures vividly illustrate the
stark contrast in OS time between tumors with higher TP53 expression (depicted by the red
line) and those with lower TP53 expression (indicated by the blue line). The hazard ratio
(HR) further underscores the impact of TP53 on overall survival.

In summary, our comprehensive analysis provides compelling evidence of the pivotal
roles played by TP53 and TP53 overexpression in shaping cancer prognosis across various
tumor types. These findings carry significant implications for clinical management and
underscore the need for further research into the underlying molecular mechanisms driving
these associations.

p53 Protein Network

Genes with strong or very strong positive correlations with TP53 expression in
13 among 27 cancers and also some negative correlations with important tumor suppressor
genes were identified in the TP53 protein network.

The protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a crucial enzyme involved in regulating
various cellular functions. It serves as an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, linking tran-
scriptional regulation to intracellular energetics. SIRT1 plays a pivotal role in coordinating
cellular processes such as the cell cycle, DNA damage response, metabolism, apoptosis,
and autophagy. One of its primary functions is the deacetylation of histones, which can
modify chromatin function, leading to transcriptional repression. Additionally, SIRT1 can
deacetylate a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thus regulating the
expression of target genes.

CREB-binding protein (CBP) is an acetyltransferase that plays a key role in histone
acetylation. By acetylating histones, CBP adds specific tags for transcriptional activation.
Furthermore, CBP can acetylate non-histone proteins like DDX21, FBL, IRF2, MAFG,
NCOA3, POLR1E/PAF53, and FOXO1. It specifically binds to phosphorylated CREB,
enhancing its transcriptional activity towards cAMP-responsive genes. CBP also acts as a
coactivator of various transcriptional activators, including the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1
and CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimers involved in circadian rhythm regulation.

Histone acetyltransferase p300 is another important enzyme involved in histone
acetylation and transcriptional regulation. p300 acetylates all four core histones in nu-
cleosomes, resulting in an epigenetic mark that promotes transcriptional activation. It
mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding to phosphorylated CREB protein and acety-
lates histone H3 at specific lysine residues, including ‘Lys-122’ and ‘Lys-27’, contributing to
transcriptional stimulation.

Serine-protein kinase ATM is a crucial sensor of DNA damage and cellular stress. It
activates checkpoint signaling pathways in response to double-strand breaks, apoptosis,
and genotoxic stresses. ATM phosphorylates ‘Ser-139’ of histone variant H2AX at double-
strand breaks, thereby regulating the DNA damage response.
It also plays a role in
processes such as pre-B cell allelic exclusion, which enforces clonality and monospecificity
of immunoglobulin heavy chain alleles.

Death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX) functions as a transcription corepressor,
repressing the transcriptional potential of sumoylated transcription factors. DAXX can
inhibit basal and activated transcription by modulating subnuclear compartments like
the nucleolus or PML/POD/ND10 nuclear bodies. It may influence TNFRSF6-dependent
apoptosis and inhibit the transcriptional activation of specific genes, such as PAX3 and ETS1.
Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha is a molecular chaperone responsible for promoting
the maturation, structural maintenance, and regulation of various target proteins. It engages
in a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity, facilitating the activation of client proteins.
HSP 90-alpha interacts dynamically with co-chaperones to modulate substrate recognition
and chaperone function.

E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2 is a critical regulator of p53 protein levels.
It
mediates the ubiquitination of p53, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Mdm2
also inhibits the transcriptional activation of p53 by binding to its activation domain and
promotes the nuclear export of p53. Additionally, it plays a role in various cellular processes,
including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

Replication protein A 70 kDa DNA-binding subunit (RPA70) is a component of the
RPA complex, which stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates during DNA replication
and DNA stress. RPA70 prevents the re-annealing of single-stranded DNA and recruits the
various proteins involved in DNA metabolism. It plays a crucial role in DNA replication
and the cellular response to DNA damage.

14-3-3 protein sigma is an adapter protein involved in the regulation of multiple
signaling pathways. It binds to phosphorylated serine or threonine motifs in various
partner proteins, modulating their activity. 14-3-3 protein sigma can regulate protein

Genes 2024, 15, 577

22 of 30

synthesis, epithelial cell growth, and the degradation of MDM2, leading to the activation
of p53.

Cellular tumor antigen p53 (p53) is a well-known tumor suppressor that regulates
cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It acts as a trans-activator to negatively regulate cell
division by controlling a set of genes essential for this process. p53 can induce growth arrest
or apoptosis in response to different cellular circumstances, depending on the context. It
plays a central role in preventing the development of various tumor types.

Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2 (ASPP2) is a regulator that interacts with TP53
(p53) and enhances its DNA binding and transactivation function. ASPP2 is involved in
the regulation of apoptosis and cell growth and can inhibit cell cycle progression at G2/M.
It also plays a role in modulating the activity of proteins like APPBP1 and DDX42.

The mentioned proteins in the TP53 network are associated with strong or very strong
positive correlations with TP53 expression in various cancers. They also participate in
different cellular pathways, including those related to cell cycle regulation, DNA damage re-
sponse, and transcriptional control. Furthermore, proteins with TF binding sites on both the
promoter and enhancer regions of UBE2C are involved in the TP53 network, contributing to
the complexity of its regulatory interactions. TSPYL2, a tumor suppressor protein, interacts
with UBE2C and is implicated in chromatin remodeling and RNA-RNA and RNA-protein
interactions in the context of the UBE2C protein network. Additionally, the presence of a D-
box motif in TSPYL2 suggests its involvement in the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. These
findings highlight the intricate network of protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions
in the regulation of cellular processes associated with TP53.

In Figure 15, we are presented with an illustration depicting the intricate TP53 protein
network sourced from the comprehensive STRING database. This visual representation
offers a glimpse into the complex interplay of TP53 proteins and their interactions as
documented within the STRING database.

steady-state concentrations, aiding in the identification of proteins reaching stability. This
analysis provides valuable information about the equilibrium levels of proteins within the
TP53 network, shedding light on their potential roles in cellular processes.

with 10% random noise. Solid lines depict original concentrations, while dashed lines

protein concentrations. This analysis helps assess the robustness of the TP53 network to
variations in kinetic parameters, providing insights into its stability and responsiveness to
external stimuli.

to 2.0, scaling rate constants. Subplots display protein concentration profiles for different
parameter values, revealing the system’s sensitivity to parameter changes. This analysis
elucidates how alterations in kinetic parameters affect the behavior of the TP53 network,
offering crucial information for understanding its regulatory mechanisms and potential
therapeutic interventions.

6. Discussion

The investigation into TP53 overexpression across various cancers has yielded com-
pelling findings regarding its association with overall survival (OS) and disease-free sur-
vival (DFS). Elevated TP53 expression consistently correlates with shorter OS and poorer
prognoses across multiple cancer types, emphasizing its significance in cancer progression.
This observation underscores the critical role of TP53 as a biomarker for predicting patient
outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. By elucidating the impact of TP53 expression
levels on survival outcomes, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mech-
anisms driving cancer progression and highlights the potential clinical implications of
targeting TP53 in cancer therapy.

Furthermore, the study delves into detailed analyses of TP53 expression patterns,
revealing correlations with different pathological stages, thus shedding light on TP53’s role
in driving malignant characteristics. By categorizing tumors based on TP53 expression
levels and pathological stages, we uncover the intricate relationship between TP53 dysregu-
lation and cancer progression. This nuanced understanding enhances our ability to stratify
patients based on their TP53 status and may facilitate the development of personalized
treatment approaches tailored to individual tumor characteristics.

In contrast with existing literature, our study presents a scientifically rigorous and
comprehensive analysis of TP53 expression dynamics across diverse cancer types and sub-
types [36]. Leveraging the extensive dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [37],
we meticulously explore the intricate molecular landscape of cancer, aiming to discern
unique genetic alterations associated with specific cancer types. This meticulous investiga-
tion enhances our understanding of TP53’s multifaceted role in cancer biology by dissecting
its involvement in various biological pathways [38].

There is a significant difference in the role of p53 in cancer etiology when comparing
our results with those of Chunyan Gao and Fangqi Chen regarding the dynamics of p53
in the DNA damage response. Our research highlights the necessity for focused therapy
approaches and highlights the diverse role of increased p53 beyond tumor suppression by
indicating that it may unintentionally promote carcinogenesis. On the other hand, Gao
and Chen argue that Mdm2 delays induced pulsatile p53 expression and affects DNA
damage responses, indicating possible targets for therapy. Despite their differences, both
studies highlight the complex function that p53 plays in cancer and call for more research
to develop specialized treatments [18,19].

Comparing our results to those reported in the Donehower et al. study [39] reveals
that TP53 mutations play a critical role in the biology of cancer. Although the focus of our

Genes 2024, 15, 577

26 of 30

research is on the contradictory effects of the overexpression of TP53 on carcinogenesis
in different forms of cancer, Donehower et al.’s work [39] offers a thorough examination
of TP53 mutations and their consequences for patient survival. While Donehower et
al.’s work [39] explores the molecular pathways behind TP53 variations across multiple
malignancies, our analysis reveals TP53 overexpression as a strong prognostic predictor,
notably in prostate adenocarcinoma. Despite these variations, both pieces of research stress
how crucial it is to combine various analyses to improve our knowledge of TP53 in cancer
and provide specialized treatment approaches. When incorporating knowledge from TP53
expression studies, it is essential to combine dynamics with a thorough assessments of
TP53 mutations to inform precision medicine methods for the treatment of cancer.

Significant insights into p53’s function in treatment outcomes are provided by the
study examining its prognostic value in chemotherapy response in advanced breast cancer.
It also reveals a close relationship between the efficacy of chemotherapy, especially FEC,
and p53 status in breast cancers. Interestingly, treatment failure with FEC is highly corre-
lated with positive p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TP53 mutations, emphasizing
the critical role that intact p53 function plays in modulating the cytotoxic effects of those
drugs that damage DNA. On the other hand, paclitaxel response, which is thought to be
independent of p53 function, does not show a correlation with p53 status. However, a
correlation between aberrant p53 and paclitaxel response is noted, indicating that tumors
may become more sensitive to this chemotherapy regimen if p53 is defective [40]. This ob-
servation is consistent with our research about the contradictory function of overexpressed
p53 in the etiology of cancer and its possible effects on treatment outcomes. The breast
cancer study offers important clinical insights into chemotherapy response based on p53
status, highlighting the variability in chemotherapy efficacy based on tumor p53 status
and the potential for customizing treatment strategies to optimize therapeutic outcomes
in breast cancer and other malignancies [40]. Our study also sheds light on the broader
landscape of p53 dysregulation across various cancer types and its impact on disease-free
survival (DFS).

Through our exploration of TP53’s engagement in fundamental biological processes
such as cell cycle control and apoptosis [41], we transcend mere correlation analysis. We
endeavor to elucidate the intricate regulatory mechanisms orchestrated by TP53, unraveling
how its dysregulation exerts influence on the essential cellular functions crucial to cancer
development and progression [42].

Our integrative approach goes beyond surface-level analysis, unveiling novel asso-
ciations between TP53 dysregulation and the pivotal signaling pathways implicated in
cancer pathogenesis. By systematically dissecting these molecular interactions, we unveil
the intricate crosstalk between TP53 and other molecular constituents, thereby deepening
our comprehension of the complex molecular network governing cancer biology.

Our study represents a significant scientific advancement, offering a comprehensive
understanding of TP53’s pivotal role in cancer progression. By elucidating the molecular
mechanisms underpinning TP53 dysregulation and its intricate connections to key signaling
pathways [43], we provide a foundation for the development of precision therapeutic
interventions aimed at disrupting these pathways and improving clinical outcomes across
diverse cancer types.

However, it is essential to acknowledge the study’s limitations. Our approach heavily
relies on bioinformatics tools and databases, potentially introducing biases or inaccuracies
into the analysis. While TCGA [44] data offer a wealth of information, it is essential to
validate our findings experimentally to ensure their reliability and robustness. Additionally,
the scope of the study is confined to the analysis of existing data, overlooking factors such
as tumor heterogeneity and patient demographics, which could provide further context to
the findings. Future studies should address these limitations by incorporating experimental
validation and considering additional clinical and molecular variables.

Moreover, one key limitation arises from our methodology in handling the false dis-
covery rate (FDR). We included data points with p-values less than or equal to 0.05 without

Genes 2024, 15, 577

27 of 30

conducting additional adjustments for multiple comparisons, which could introduce the
risk of type I errors, especially considering the multiple comparisons across various datasets.
This aspect of our methodological approach could potentially affect the interpretation of our
results and the generalizability of the study. We recommend that future research includes
more rigorous statistical controls to mitigate this limitation.

Despite these limitations, the implications of our study are significant, extending
beyond research to clinical practice and drug development. The insights gained into the
complex interplay between TP53 expression and cancer progression can inform tailored
treatment strategies based on individual tumor characteristics. Furthermore, the identifi-
cation of unique genetic alterations associated with specific cancer types opens avenues
for targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches. Ultimately, our study un-
derscores the importance of continued research into TP53 biology for advancing cancer
diagnostics and therapeutics, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary approaches inte-
grating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to unravel the complexities of TP53
signaling in cancer.

Comparing our findings with available literature provides a broader perspective on
the significance of p53 overexpression in tumors and its clinical implications. Our study
reinforces the well-established notions of p53 as the “guardian of the genome” [1] and its
association with aggressive cancers. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis extends these
concepts to a broader array of cancer types, offering insights that can inform therapeutic
strategies and emphasizing the need for precision medicine approaches based on TP53
status. By integrating findings from multiple studies, we consolidate existing knowledge
and identify areas for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms
underlying TP53 dysregulation in cancer.

In conclusion, our study leverages TCGA data to investigate TP53 expression pat-
terns, providing robust and consistent findings that echo prior research in the field. The
exploration of p53’s pathological stages introduces an innovative dimension to our under-
standing of its clinical implications, complementing and extending the work of previous
scholars. These insights collectively reinforce the significance of TP53 in the landscape of
cancer biology and underscore its utility as a prognostic marker with multifaceted roles
in cancer progression. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving TP53 dysregula-
tion and its implications for cancer prognosis and treatment, our study contributes to the
growing body of evidence supporting TP53 as a central player in cancer biology.

8. Conclusions

The role of p53 in cancer biology is multifaceted, with both tumor suppressor and
oncogenic functions depending on its expression levels and mutation status. Heightened
p53 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poorer prognosis across
various cancer types. Tailored treatment strategies involving a combination of therapies
are essential for managing tumors with p53 overexpression. Analysis of p53 expression
patterns provides valuable insights into tumor classification, prognosis prediction, and
treatment selection. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of p53 expression un-
