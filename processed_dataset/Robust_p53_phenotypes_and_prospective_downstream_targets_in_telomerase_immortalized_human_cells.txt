ABSTRACT

Cancers that retain wild type TP53 presumably harbor other clonal alterations 
that  permitted  their  precursors  to  bypass  p53-mediated  growth  suppression. 
Consequently, studies that employ TP53-wild type cancer cells and their isogenic 
derivatives may systematically fail to appreciate the full scope of p53 functionality. 
Several TP53 phenotypes are known to be absent in the widely used isogenic HCT116 
colorectal cancer (CRC) model, which originated from a tumor that had retained 
wild type TP53. In contrast, we show that restoration of p53 in the TP53-mutant 
CRC cell line DLD-1 impeded cell proliferation, increased levels of senescence and 
sensitized cells to ionizing radiation (IR). To study p53 in a non-cancer context, 
we  disrupted  TP53  in  hTERT-RPE1  cells.  Derived  from  primary  cells  that  were 
immortalized in vitro, hTERT-RPE1 expressed striking p53-dependent phenotypes 
and appeared to select for p53 loss during routine culture. hTERT-RPE1 expressed a 
p53-responsive transcriptome that was highly representative of diverse experimental 
systems. We discovered several novel downstream p53 targets of potential clinical 
relevance including ALDH3A1, which is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes 
and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, and nectin cell adhesion molecule 4 
(NECTIN4) which encodes a secreted surface protein that is overexpressed in many 
tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Genetic  alterations  that  change  the  functions  of 
p53 or other proteins in the p53 pathway are present in a 
majority of cancers. Despite the high frequency of TP53 
mutations, some tumor-derived cell lines retain wild type 
alleles and express wild type p53 protein. Such cell lines, 
paired  with  isogenic  derivatives  that  are  p53-deficient, 
have found wide use in basic and translational research. 
However, TP53-wild type cancer cells are not “normal”, 
nor  can  their  p53  pathways  be  presumed  to  be  entirely 
intact.  On  the  contrary  it  is  logical  to  assume  that  any 

expanding TP53-wild type cell population that enters the 
evolutionary bottleneck of tumorigenesis would require 
other  compensatory  clonal  alterations  to  escape  p53-
mediated tumor-suppression.

Human  somatic  cells  with 

targeted  genetic 
modifications have contributed much to our understanding 
of human p53. The strengths and limitations of knockout 
cancer  cell  lines  are  exemplified  by  the  first  isogenic 
cell  system  for  the  study  of  human  p53.  Generated  25 
years  ago  from  the  colorectal  cancer  cell  line  HCT116 
[1]  and  widely  distributed  thereafter,  the  original 
human  somatic  cell  p53-knockouts  exhibit  many

checkpoints and resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [2], 
a  first  line  therapeutic  agent  for  CRC.  This  distinctive 
survival  phenotype,  uniquely  elicited  by  5-FU  in  p53-
deficient HCT116 cells, established a plausible molecular 
mechanism for therapeutic resistance. However, HCT116 
do not model the expected effects of p53 on growth in 
culture or on radioresistance [3]. Other basic processes 
such as p53 turnover, mediated by the feedback loop by 
which MDM2 controls p53 stability before and after DNA 
damage, are also defective in parental HCT116 [4].

In  2009,  we  employed  targeted  homologous 
recombination  to  derive  additional  p53-proficient  and 
-deficient  isogenic  cell  pairs  from  the  CRC  cell  lines 
DLD-1, RKO, and SW48 [5]. This expanded cell panel 
from etiologically-related cancers was successfully used to 
identify new approaches to therapeutically exploit defects 
in p53. Like HCT116, each of these cell lines was derived 
from  a  mismatch  repair-deficient  cancer  and  therefore 
harbors many mutations [6]. Most of these mutations are 
undoubtably passengers of no functional consequence, but 
the full phenotypic impact of this high mutational burden 
remains unknown.

To  study  p53  in  a  human  cell  line  with  a  low 
number of mutations and a defined basis for immortal 
growth,  some  investigators  have  turned  to  hTERT-
RPE1.  This  cell  line  was  derived  from  the  primary 
retinal  pigment  epithelial  cell  line  RPE-340  [7]  Like 
other  primary  cells,  RPE-340  undergo  replicative 
senescence  after  50–60  passages.  This  limit,  first 
described  by  Hayflick,  was  successfully  bypassed  by 
the  forced  overexpression  of  the  catalytic  subunit  of 
the  enzyme  telomerase,  hTERT.  Thus  immortalized, 
hTERT-RPE1 cells have a stable diploid karyotype, are 
non-tumorigenic [8] and are widely used as a model of 
normal cellular function in studies of cell signaling and 
cell proliferation.

In  most  cell  lineages,  the  bypass  of  replicative 
senescence requires the introduction of a cellular or viral 
oncogene, such as SV40 large T antigen, in addition to 
telomerase. Such oncogenes typically interact with p53 and 
suppress its function. hTERT-RPE1 cells, immortalized by 
telomerase expression alone, are therefore uniquely suited 
for the study of p53 phenotypes.

Studies  employing  hTERT-RPE1  cells  and 
CRISPR-based  gene  editing  techniques  have  recently 
provided new insight into some of functions of p53 that 
are  important  during  unperturbed  growth,  such  as  the 
arrest of cell growth in response to mitotic dysfunction 
[9]  and  the  suppression  of  polyploidization  [10].  Some 
relatively  subtle  p53  phenotypes  observed  in  hTERT-
RPE1 are notably lacking in p53-proficient cancer cells. 
For example, Solokova et al. [11] observed that slowing 
the rate of DNA replication by histone depletion caused a 
p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in hTERT-RPE1 cells. This 
response was reportedly absent in cancer cell lines such 

80

as HCT116, which were found to more closely resemble 
p53-deficient hTERT-RPE1 in this regard.

Indirect evidence also points to a particularly robust 
p53 pathway in non-cancer cell types. Several groups have 
reported that the small numbers of targeted double strand 
DNA  breaks  created  by  CRISPR-Cas9  complexes  are 
sufficient to activate p53 in human stem cells and hTERT-
RPE1 [12, 13]. In the context of a CRISPR library screen, 
the activation of p53 can markedly reduce the yield, as 
many clones are stochastically eliminated. This technical 
issue, particularly problematic in non-cancer models, can 
reportedly be overcome by modified screening protocols 
[14]  but  nonetheless  indicates  a  sensitivity  to  p53 
activation that is apparently lacking in many cell types.

Senescence is an important barrier to neoplastic cell 
growth and an antiproliferative response to p53 activation. 
We  previously  observed  that  senescence  could  not  be 
induced  in  HCT116  cells  by  DNA  damage  unless  they 
were haploinsufficient for hTERT [3], which encodes the 
catalytic subunit of telomerase. One interpretation of this 
finding is that the pathways to senescence remain partially 
intact  in  HCT116,  but  were  somehow  downregulated 
during tumorigenesis. Here we report that restoration of 
wild type p53 in DLD-1, a p53-deficient CRC cell line, 
was sufficient to cause elevated levels of senescence and 
sensitivity to IR. In addition, our comprehensive analysis 
of non-senescing hTERT-RPE1 cells revealed prominent 
p53-dependent phenotypes, and novel downstream targets 
and pathways to be further explored.

RESULTS

Restoration of p53 in DLD-1 cells reduces 
proliferation and increases senescence

In  response 

to  DNA  damage,  p53  directly 
stimulates  the  transcription  of  numerous  downstream 
target  genes  [15,  16].  To  comparatively  evaluate  p53-
dependent responses to IR in cell lines originating from 
the  same  tissue,  we  examined  four  isogenic  CRC  cell 
pairs previously generated by homologous recombination 
[5]. Three of the parental cell lines, HCT116, RKO and 
SW48, harbor wild type TP53; these wild type alleles were 
disrupted  to  create  respective  p53-deficient  knockouts 
in  each  line  (Figure  1A).  A  fourth  cell  line,  DLD-1, 
exclusively expresses a mutant form of p53 in which the 
serine residue at position 241 is replaced by phenylalanine 
(S241F).  Wild  type  p53  function  was  restored  in  these 
cells by knocking in wild type coding sequences into the 
endogenous locus [5].

We reevaluated DNA damage- and p53-dependent 
gene  expression  in  this  CRC  cell  panel.  To  quantify 
the  number  of  transcripts  that  were  induced  by  p53  in 
response  to  IR,  we  first  identified  microarray  probe 
signals that were induced more than 2-fold by IR in each 
p53-proficient  cell  line,  as  described  [5].  Among  each

were induced at a higher level in p53-proficient versus 
p53-deficient cells of the same type. The DLD-1 isogenic 
cell pair, created by p53 restoration, produced the largest 
number  of  IR-induced,  p53-dependent  probe  signals 
(Figure 1B); each of the cell lines that naturally retained 
wild type TP53 induced a lower number of probes at each 
cutoff.

p53 and its canonical downstream target p21 were 
induced by IR in HCT116, the most widely disseminated 
among the cells in this CRC panel, and in DLD-1 with 
restored p53 function (DLD-1 p53WT) (Figure 1C). Both 
p53 and p21 appeared to be induced to a greater extent 
in DLD-1 p53WT than in HCT116 p53WT, which expressed 

detectable  levels  of  both  proteins  in  the  absence  of  IR 
treatment.  Consistent  with  previously  published  results 
from our laboratory, there was no significant difference 
in  clonogenic  survival  after  IR  treatment  between  p53-
proficient  and  -deficient  HCT116  cells  (Figure  1D). 
In  contrast,  DLD-1  p53WT  cells  were  demonstrably 
radiosensitive  when  compared  with  isogenic  DLD-1 
p53MUT cells.

The colonies formed by DLD-1 p53WT on all plates, 
irrespective  of  their  treatment,  were  smaller  than  those 
formed  by  isogenic  cells  that  expressed  mutant  p53 
(Figure 2A, 2B), suggesting that p53 was an impediment 
to  cell  proliferation.  Monolayer  cultures  were  stained 
for  senescence-associated  β-galactosidase  (Figure  2C).

Oncotargetwww.oncotarget.comDespite  the  low  level  of  p53  protein  present  in  non-
irradiated cells (Figure 1C), DLD-1 p53WT cells stained 
positive for this marker of senescence; staining appeared 
more pronounced following IR treatment. In contrast, few 
stained cells were observed in the DLD-1 p53MUT cultures 
or in HCT116 of either genotype.

Increased cell proliferation following disruption 
of TP53 in hTERT-immortalized cells

We next sought to investigate the effects of p53 in 
human cells that did not originate in a tumor. Our rationale 
was that in the absence of in vivo selection for loss of p53 
function, immortalized cells might retain more subtle but 
quantifiable  p53  phenotypes  that  are  commonly  lost  in 
evolving cancers.

The TP53 locus expresses several related proteins 
from two endogenous promoters (Figure 3A). To eliminate 
the possible confounding effects of off-target editing, we 
eliminated  p53  expression  by  two  editing  approaches. 
TP53 exon 7, which is common to all known isoforms, was 
disrupted at a single site. Alternatively, we simultaneously 
targeted  two  sites  that  flank  exon  1,  thereby  causing  a 
deletion.  Multiple  knockout  clones  were  identified  by 
western blot and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

As expected, p53 and p21 were induced in hTERT-
RPE1 cells by IR (Figure 3B). Both of the p53 knockout 
cell  lines,  KO-ex7  and  KO-ex1,  were  radioresistant 
compared with p53-proficient parental cells (Figure 3C). 
As in the DLD-1 isogenic system (Figure 2A), colonies 
that expressed wild type p53 were noticeably smaller than 
those formed by p53-knockout cells (Figure 3D). The size 
of the colonies was fairly uniform within each population, 
suggesting  that  there  was  limited  variation  between 
subclones  of  the  same  genotype.  An  increased  rate  of 
growth in p53 knockout cells was additionally quantified 
by time lapse microscopy (Figure 3E).

Expansion of an hTERT-RPE1 subclone that 
harbors a cancer-associated p53 mutation

We inadvertently isolated a single clone that retained 
wild type exon 7 sequences and expressed elevated levels 
of p53 protein. We sequenced the remaining exons in this 
clone and identified a single nucleotide substitution in exon 
8 (Figure 4A). A heterozygous C-to-G transversion changed 
the encoded amino acid from an alanine residue at position 
276 to proline (A276P). This alanine residue is predicted 
to form a hydrogen bond with Q136 (Figure 4B), and thus 
may  contribute  to  structural  stabilization.  Codon  276  is 
located 427 bp from the predicted CRISPR cut site in exon 
7 (Figure 4C). No other base alterations were noted.

A276P mutations were found in 19 tumors profiled 
in  the  TCGA  database  (Table  1).  Overall,  A276P/D/G 
mutations were reported in a relatively small number of 
tumors  from  diverse  tissues  [17,  18]. We  expanded  the 

83

heterozygous TP53+/A276P clone so that we could evaluate 
the phenotypic impact of this cancer-associated mutation.
A  cycloheximide  chase  experiment  demonstrated 
that  p53  in  the  hTERT-RPE1  TP53+/A276P  cells  was 
abnormally stable (Figure 4D), a cardinal feature of many 
tumor-associated  p53  mutant  proteins.  The  abundance 
of  p53  is  controlled  by  a  feedback  loop  involving  the 
E3  ubiquitin  ligase  MDM2,  which  is  induced  by  p53 
and  targets  p53  for  degradation  by  the  proteosome. As 
expected, treatment of parental hTERT-RPE1 cells with 
the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a caused p53 stabilization and 
robust induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 (Figure 4E) 
[16, 19]; these downstream effectors were not induced in 
the p53-knockouts. p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 were induced 
to a lesser extent in TP53+/A276P cells compared with wild 
type cells. The simplest interpretation of this observation 
was  that  the  p53A276P  mutant  protein  was  exerting  a 
dominant  negative  effect  on  the  co-expressed  p53-wild 
type protein.

The spontaneous expansion of a cancer-associated 
p53 mutation in a cultured cell population is an extremely 
rare event. In more than 25 years of study, we had never 
previously detected a heterozygous TP53-mutant subclone. 
As there are few heterozygous cellular models that co-
express wild type p53 and a cancer-associated mutant, we 
decided to use this unique model to characterize a wide 
range of p53-dependent phenotypes. Our goals were (1) 
to establish which of the many reported p53-dependent 
phenotypes could be elicited in the hTERT-RPE1 cell line, 
and (2) to explore which of these phenotypes was subject 
to  dominant-negative  inhibition  by  the  p53A276P  mutant 
protein.

The dominant-negative effect of p53A276P appears 
to be limited to transcriptional transactivation

While activated p53 upregulates the activity of its 
target genes after DNA damage or MDM2 inhibition, p53 
suppresses transcription in the absence of upstream signals 
[20, 21] . The epigenetic repression of transcription by p53 
is mediated by the methylation of histone H3K9 [22, 23]. 
A repressive mark, H3K9 trimethylation is continuously 
maintained in the absence of DNA damage by a chromatin-
bound complex containing p53, USP7 and MDM2, which 
cooperatively  recruits  the  histone  methylase  SUV39H1 
[24].  This  complex  is  rapidly  disassembled  following 
DNA damage and the resulting stabilization of p53. With 
local chromatin in an active euchromatic state, p53 forms 
DNA-bound  tetramers  that  are  required  for  target  gene 
induction. Conversely, the H3K9me3 mark is elevated in 
heterochromatin, and maintained in this transcriptionally 
inactive state by monomeric and dimeric p53. By exerting 
dynamic control over select genes before and after DNA 
damage, p53 mediates a bistable transcriptional switch.

The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin stimulates 
p53  tetramerization  and  thereby  disrupts  the  complex

determined by two-sample t-tests. No asterisks, p < 0.1, deemed not significant. The differences between the two independent p53-knockout

required for the retention of SUV39H2 at p53 responsive 
promoters [23]. A global reduction in H3K9me3 protein 
following doxorubicin treatment, previously characterized 
in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 [23], was clearly 
observed  in  unmodified  hTERT-RPE1,  retained  in  the

chromatin-associated 

We  further  examined  the  effects  of  the  p53A276P 
mutant on p53-dependent gene regulation by assessing 
oligomeric, 
of 
endogenous p53 proteins. By crosslinking these protein 
complexes  with  glutaraldehyde,  we  were  able  to 
resolve  endogenous  p53  dimers,  tetramers  and  higher 
order  oligomers  (Figure  5B).  In  the  absence  of  DNA 
damage, most of the p53 complexes in TP53+/A276P cells 
were  dimers,  which  are  generally  transcriptionally 
inactive.  Cells  that  expressed  only  wild  type  p53,  in 
contrast, exhibited a range of p53 complexes, including 
transcriptionally  active 
tetramers.  Following  DNA 
damage, p53 in wild type cells formed both dimers and 
tetramers.  TP53+/A276P  cells  expressed  a  proportionally 
lower  amount  of  tetrameric  p53,  consistent  with  the 
observed reduction in p21 and MDM2 induction in this 
line (Figure 4E). These patterns suggest that the stable 
p53A276P  mutant  protein  primarily  formed  repressive 
homo-  and  heterodimers,  consistent  with  a  dominant-
negative effect on transcription.

The  localization  of  p53  is  tightly  controlled  by 
ubiquitination.  In  the  absence  of  DNA  damage,  p53 
largely resides outside the nucleus. In unstimulated cells 
with low p53 and low MDM2, the nuclear export of p53 is 
mediated by MDM2-mediated mono-ubiquitination [25]. 
When MDM2 levels are high, as is the case when cells are 
recovering from DNA damage, p53 is polyubiquitinated 
and  thus  rapidly  targeted  for  degradation  by  the 
proteasome.  Pulldowns  of  ubiquitin  revealed  increased 
levels  of  p53  mono-  and  poly-ubiquitination  in  the 
unperturbed  TP53+/A276P  cells  (Figure  5C). Accordingly, 
p53  was  found  disproportionately  in  the  membrane-
associated fraction in TP53+/A276P (Figure 5D). The basal 
levels of nuclear p53 were more modestly increased in 
these cells compared with parental hTERT-RPE1.

Phosphorylation  by  calcium-dependent  protein 
kinase C (PKC) has also been identified as an important 
requirement for normal p53 turnover in unstressed cells 
[26, 27]. To stimulate p53 turnover via PKC, we treated 
hTERT-RPE1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA). This phorbol ester is a synthetic analog of diacyl 
glycerol,  the  endogenous  activator  of  PKC-mediated 
signal  transduction.  TP53+/+,  TP53−/−  and  TP53+/A276P 
cells  were  treated  with  PMA  alone,  or  with  PMA  in 
combination  with  nutlin-3a  (Figure  6A).  PMA  did  not 
affect  the  stabilization  of  p53  after  MDM2  inhibition, 
supporting the current model in which MDM2 and PKC

cells.  However,  PMA  administered  without  nutlin-3a 
selectively and dramatically decreased the level of p53 
in the TP53+/A276P cell line. Over a 12 h time course, PMA 
reduced p53 to similar levels in TP53+/+ and TP53+/A276P 
cells (Figure 6B).

PMA  has  antiproliferative  effects  on  some  cell 
types, which are mainly mediated by the p53-independent 

induction  of  p21WAF1/CIP1  [28–30].  This  Ca2+  dependent 
pathway for cell cycle regulation was clearly intact in the 
hTERT-RPE1 cell panel (Figure 6A, 6B). Interestingly, the 
p53-independent upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 by PMA was 
attenuated in TP53+/A276P cells (Figure 6B). It is possible 
that  p53  dimers  containing  mutant  protein  (Figure  5B) 
enhanced epigenetic silencing at the CDKN1A promoter in 
the absence of DNA damage. These experiments illustrate

are  similarly  controlled  by  Ca2+-dependent  signaling, 
suggesting a possible therapeutic approach to suppressing 
the gains-of-function caused by this mutation.

As  an  important  mediator  of  apoptosis,  p53 
also  plays  a  cytoplasmic  role  in  Ca2+  signaling.  p53 
directly  binds  to  the  Sarcoendoplasmic  Ca2+-ATPase 
(SERCA) pump at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
mitochondria-associated  membranes  and  stimulates  the 
enhanced transfer of Ca2+ to the mitochondria [31]. In this 
transcription-independent manner, wild type p53 increases 
mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and lowers 
the threshold for apoptosis.

The  abundance  of  wild  type  and  mutant  p53  at 
the  ER-associated  membranes  of  hTERT-RPE1  cells 
(Figure  5D)  prompted  us  to  investigate  the  impact  of 
these  proteins  on  SERCA  activity.  We  used  a  genetic 
biosensor to measure the relative levels of Ca2+ in the ER 
lumen, the main repository for intracellular calcium, and 
in the nucleus. An aequorin-based Ca2+ reporter system, 
insensitive  to  local  pH  and  Mg2+,  can  be  specifically 
targeted  to  several  organelles  via  fusion  with  signaling 
peptides  [32].  Parental  hTERT-RPE1,  TP53−/−  and  the 
TP53+/A276P mutant cell line were each stably transfected 
with  reporter  constructs  encoding  a  green  fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-Aequorin fusion Protein (GAP) targeted to

with nutlin-3a (10 µM) and/or PMA (100 ng/ml) for 8 h. (B) Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA and harvested for protein analysis 
at the indicated time points. The indicated proteins were assayed by western blot. The migration of relevant molecular weight markers, 
in kDa, are shown to the right of each blot. (C) GAP biosensors were used to assess relative Ca2+ levels in the ER and the nucleus. Where 
indicated, ER Ca2+ was selectively depleted by treating cells with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin for 24 h. The TP53−/− cells used in these 
experiments contain the exon 7 knockout.

88

Oncotargetwww.oncotarget.comthe ER or to the nucleus. Organelle-specific Ca2+ levels 
were then determined in individual cells by dual-excitation 
ratiometric imaging, as described [32].

The  levels  of  Ca2+  in  the  ER  were  significantly 
reduced in TP53−/− compared with wild type cells; Ca2+ 
levels were decreased to an intermediate level in TP53+/
A276P cells (Figure 6C). This finding is consistent with the 
established role of cytoplasmic p53 as a direct SERCA 
activator  [31]. As  the  levels  of  ER-localized  p53  were 
significantly elevated in the TP53+/A276P cell line (Figure 
5D), we infer that the mutant p53A276P protein was non-
functional  with  respect  to  SERCA  activation,  but  did 
not  exert  a  dominant  negative  effect.  As  expected, 
the store of Ca2+ in the ER was depleted in response to 
SERCA inhibition by thapsigargin in all cells irrespective 
of  genotype.  The  levels  of  Ca2+  in  the  nucleus  were 
predictably low and did not differ substantially between 
the three isogenic cell lines (Figure 6C).

In  summary,  the  dominant-negative  effects  of 
p53A276P  are  most  clearly  manifest  by  the  inhibition  of 
transcriptionally active p53 complexes. Interestingly, this 
inhibitory effect was also apparent at the p21 promoter 
when it was activated by a p53-independent mechanism 
(Figure 6A, 6B). In contrast, the p53A276P protein did not 
appear  to  inhibit  the  cytoplasmic  function  of  wild  type 
p53 at SERCA (Figure 6C). Luminal Ca2+ was somewhat 
decreased  in  the  TP53+/A276P  cells,  but  we  believe  this 
observation can be most likely attributed to reduced TP53 
gene dosage rather than a dominant-negative effect.

Induction of p53 target genes is variably 
inhibited by p53A276P

Cancer cells that harbor inactivating mutations in 
TP53 express only the corresponding p53 mutant protein; 
wild type protein expression is invariably lost via loss-of-
heterozygosity (LOH) or gene silencing, as in DLD-1. The 
heterozygous hTERT-RPE1 cell clone therefore provided 
a unique opportunity to evaluate the functional impact of 
p53A276P  when  co-expressed  with  wild  type  protein.  To 
quantify such effects, we evaluated gene expression.

The  expression  of  several  established  p53  targets 
was first confirmed by RT-qPCR. As expected, CDKN1A 
(which  encodes  p21),  MDM2  and  FDXR  were  each 
robustly induced in unmodified hTERT-RPE1 following 
stimulation with nutlin-3a (Figure 7A). Induction of these 
genes  was  lost  in  TP53−/−  cells  and  notably  reduced  in 
the TP53+/A276P cells, demonstrating a dominant negative 
effect  of  the  p53A276P  mutant  protein  with  respect  to 
transcriptional transactivation.

We  next 

characterized 

the  p53-dependent 
transcriptome expressed in hTERT-RPE1 by bulk RNA-
seq (Figure 7B). A set of genes that were tightly controlled 
by p53 in these cells was defined by first identifying those 
that  were  induced  at  least  3-fold  in  wild  type  hTERT-
RPE1 after treatment with nutlin-3a for 8 h. This early 

time point was chosen to minimize indirect effects caused 
by  upregulation  by  p53  of  other  transcription  factors. 
Among these nutlin-3a responsive genes, 27 were induced 
at least 10-fold higher in wild type RPE1 cells compared 
with isogenic TP53−/− cells that were treated with nutlin-
3a in parallel. The induction of this defined transcriptome 
by nutlin-3a was broadly attenuated in the heterozygous 
TP53+/A276P cells (Figure 5B).

Identification and validation of novel p53 target 
genes

Of  the  27  genes  most  robustly  upregulated  in  a 
p53-dependent  manner,  22  had  previously  been  linked 
to  p53  with  varying  levels  of  confidence  in  disparate 
experimental systems [33–58]. The remaining five genes 
had  not  previously  been  identified  as  transcriptional 
targets  of  p53.  To  investigate  whether  their  regulation 
might involve direct transactivation by p53, we examined 
immunoprecipitation 
publicly  available  chromatin 
(ChIP)-seq data in the ReMap2022 database [59]. Among 
these five prospective p53-regulated genes identified in 
our  analysis,  two  harbored  p53  binding  sites  that  were 
experimentally identified.

ALDH3A1 encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase, a 
class of enzymes that are involved in the detoxification 
of reactive aldehydes that can trigger the production of 
reactive oxygen species. ALDH3A1 was recently shown 
to confer resistance to oxidative stress by modulating the 
DNA damage response [60]. A major p53 ChIP-seq peak 
was found approximately 5 kb upstream of the annotated 
first ALDH3A1 exon (Figure 8A). However, an alternative 
transcription  start  site  identified  by  the  FANTOM5 
consortium  [61]  was  aligned  with  a  regulatory  region 
defined by H3K27 acetylation and the p53 ChIP-seq peak 
(Figure  8A).  Inspection  of  the  sequence  immediately 
upstream of this putative transcription start site revealed 
a  18/20  match  to  the  consensus  p53  response  element 
(Figure 8B). RT-qPCR expression analysis in the hTERT-
RPE1  cell  panel  showed  a  genotype-dependent  pattern 
virtually identical to that observed in the RNA-seq data, 
with >10-fold induction by nutlin-3a in unmodified cells 
(Figure  8C).  Notably,  the  induction  of  ALDH3A1  by 
nutlin-3a  was  completely  eliminated  in  the  TP53+/A276P 
cells,  suggesting  a  predominant  effect  of  the  p53A276P 
protein  at  this  locus  compared  to  the  canonical  targets 
(Figure 7A).

NECTIN4  (alternatively  known  as  poliovirus 
receptor-like  4,  PVRL4)  is  an  immunoglobulin-like 
molecule involved in cell-cell adhesion [62]. Three distinct 
p53 ChIP-seq peaks were apparent at the NECTIN4 locus 
(Figure 8D). A minor peak was positioned just upstream 
of  the  first  coding  exon,  a  second  peak  was  located  in 
the first intron, just upstream of an antisense RNA called 
NECTIN4-AS1, and a major intragenic peak was located 
upstream  of  exon  5.  As  was  the  case  with  validated

hTERT-RPE1. (B) RNA-seq analysis of the p53-dependent transcriptome in hTERT-RPE1 and indicated derivatives. A heatmap illustrates

mRNA was induced >10-fold by nutlin-3a treatment in 
unmodified  hTERT-RPE1  (Figure  8E).  However,  the 
basal expression of NECTIN4 was modestly elevated in 
both the TP53−/− and TP53+/A276P cells and suppressed by 
nutlin-3a treatment. This complex expression pattern was 
not apparent in the RNA-seq data. The spliced NECTIN4-
AS1 transcript was slightly induced by nutlin-3a in the 
p53-knockout  cells,  but  otherwise  unaffected  by  TP53 
genotype.

The  upregulation  of ALDH3A1  and  NECTIN4  by 
p53  was  inconsistent  among  the  cell  lines  in  the  CRC 
panel (Figure 8F). In the archived array data, both genes 
were  expressed  at  levels  2-fold  higher  in  irradiated 
SW48  TP53-wild  type  cells  compared  with  isogenic 
p53-knockouts. NECTIN4 was most robustly induced in 
TP53-wild type HCT116 cells, whereas neither gene was 
induced to the threshold level by IR in RKO cells.

DISCUSSION

The successful disruption of both wild type TP53 
alleles in HCT116 provided the first isogenic knockout 
model  for  the  systematic  study  of  human  p53.  Over 
the  past  25  years,  this  model  has  yielded  a  wealth  of 
information regarding the cell-autonomous roles of p53 
and  the  vulnerabilities  of  p53-deficient  cancer  cells. 
Nonetheless, our data suggest that the robust growth of 
the  parent  cell  line  was  facilitated  by  an  attenuation  of 
p53 activity during the evolution of the original tumor. 
The increase in senescence and growth inhibition caused 
by restoration of p53 function in DLD-1 cells may be an 
indication that these phenotypes are particularly important 
suppressors  of  tumorigenesis  in  CRC  epithelia.  This 
conclusion is supported by observations of high levels of 
senescence in CRC precursor lesions that typically retain 
TP53 [63, 64].

Our  rationale  for  studying  p53  in  hTERT-RPE1 
was that in vitro immortalization by overexpression of 
telomerase  might  have  spared  the  p53  pathway  from 
negative  selection  that  would  otherwise  occur  during 
in  vivo  tumor  evolution.  The  prediction  that  these 
non-cancer  cells  would  retain  particularly  robust  p53 
phenotypes was generally supported by the data reported 
here. Cell growth and survival were increased in cells 
that were p53-deficient, and downstream transcriptional 
targets of p53 were highly induced after DNA damage 
or MDM2 inhibition. A broad range of p53-dependent 
phenotypes,  originally  observed  in  disparate  model 
systems, could be elicited in hTERT-RPE1, suggesting 
that  the  complex  pathways  upstream  and  downstream 
of  p53  are  largely  intact  and  highly  sensitive  to 
perturbation.

 An important consequence of loss of p53 function 
is  resistance  to  therapy,  particularly  radioresistance.  A 
causal association between the mutational inactivation of 

92

p53 and decreased radiation sensitivity has been supported 
by clinical studies [65–67] and preclinical animal models 
[68, 69]. In contrast, studies of the relationship between 
p53 status and survival after IR treatment performed in 
diverse  cancer  cell  line  panels  have  been  considerably 
less definitive [65, 70]. While a sensitizing effect of p53 
has recently been observed in several isogenic systems 
generated  by  gene  editing  [71,  72],  such  effects  have 
been consistently absent in the original HCT116 isogenic 
cell pair, whether assayed in vitro [3] or in vivo [2]. The 
clear  radioresistant  phenotype  of  p53-deficient  hTERT-
RPE1  suggests  that  this  unique  cell  line  will  be  useful 
for modeling the effects of IR and other DNA damaging 
therapies.

A  TP53-mutant  subclone  in  the  hTERT-RPE1 
cell population was an unexpected finding. A previous 
analysis of amino acid substitutions in the A276 position 
by  Reaz  et  al.  [73]  revealed  that  this  residue  could  be 
replaced  by  serine  (S)  or  phenylalanine  (F)  with  only 
subtle  effects  on  promoter  selection  and  transcription. 
In  contrast,  our  data  indicate  that  the  substitution  of 
proline (P) in this position created a mutant p53 protein 
that was not merely transcriptionally inactive, but could 
exert strong dominant negative effects on transcriptional 
transactivation  by  the  co-expressed  wild  type  protein. 
The A276P mutation occurs at low frequency in breast 
and  ovarian  cancers,  implying  that  there  is  selective 
pressure for expansion of this particular mutation during 
tumorigenesis.  We  speculate  that  this  potent  mutation 
arose  under  selection  for  p53  loss-of-function  in  the 
hTERT-RPE1 population.

It  is  unclear  how  the  p53A276P  mutation  initially 
arose in the hTERT-RPE1 cell line, which is known to be 
genetically  stable.  No  other  alterations  in  the  region  of 
TP53 were observed. The Cas9 protein from S. pyogenes 
that was employed in our knockout vector most commonly 
generates small, localized insertions and deletions (indels), 
with larger deletions observed at some target sites [74]. 
Based on the well-described patterns of Cas9-mediated 
mutagenesis, it would seem improbable that the A276P 
mutation  was  an  off-target  product  of  gene  editing. 
The expanded cell population was found to be clonally 
heterozygous,  indicating  that  the  mutation  must  have 
been present among the cell population from which the 
subclones  were  derived.  An  analysis  of  short  tandem 
repeats confirmed that this clone was indeed derived from 
hTERT-RPE1, ruling out the possibility of contamination 
by  cancer  cells.  It  is  therefore  likely  that  this  mutation 
arose de novo during routine cell culture.

It  may  seem  intuitively  plausible  that  driver 
mutations can arise spontaneously during serial passage 
of large cell populations, but several studies suggest that 
this in fact occurs very rarely. Jones et al. [75] found that 
287 of 289 mutations discovered in human colon cancer 
xenografts and cancer-derived cell lines were present in 
the original primary tumor samples. A follow up analysis 

Oncotargetwww.oncotarget.comby Solomon et al. of a separate set of samples and a review 
of  the  published  literature  also  found  no  evidence  of 
artifactual driver alterations caused by ex vivo cell culture 
[76]. These studies should dispel the misconception that 
there  is  significant  selection  for  oncogenic  mutations 
and  loss  of  tumor  suppressor  genes  during  the  serial 
maintenance of cancer cell cultures. It could be interesting 
to  determine  whether  deep  sequencing  approaches  can 
detect  TP53  mutations,  or  other  driver  alterations,  that 
arise  and  expand  under  selection  in  hTERT-RPE1  cell 
populations.

The  suppression  of  hTERT-RPE1  growth  by 
p53 was likely mediated, at least in part, by the cyclin-
dependent  kinase  inhibitor  p21WAF1/CIP1,  which  was 
expressed  at  a  higher  basal  level  in  wild  type  cells 
compared with the isogenic p53 knockout line (Figures 
3B,  4D).  The  detection  of  chromatin-associated  p53 
tetramers  in  the  absence  of  exogenous  DNA  damage 
(Figure 5B) further supports an active role for p53 in the 
suppression  of  unperturbed  cell  growth  in  this  model. 
Notably, p53-deficiency in HCT116 does relieve growth 
inhibition, but this phenotype is dependent on an increase 
in angiogenesis and is therefore only expressed in vivo, in 
cell-derived xenografts [77].

The  transcription-independent  roles  of  p53  are 
increasingly  coming  into  focus  [78,  79].  The  role  of 
cytoplasmic p53 on Ca2+ flux, first identified by Giorgi 
et al. [31], has been heretofore associated with apoptotic 
stimuli. Interestingly, a controlling effect of p53 on Ca2+ 
homeostasis  was  readily  apparent  in  hTERT-RPE1  the 
absence  of  exogenous  stressors.  The  ability  of  p53  to 
control Ca2+ flux is a function that is lost in the hotspot 
p53 mutants R175H and R273H. [31]. Our results suggest 
that  p53A276P,  a  mutant  found  in  far  fewer  cancers,  is 
similarly defective. We observed a bimodal distribution of 
Ca2+ content among the p53-knockout and, to a somewhat 
lesser extent, in the TP53+/A276 cell populations (Figure 
6C). The basis for this interesting distribution is unclear. 
During its catalytic cycle, SERCA is known to function 
in  two  distinct  structural  and  biochemical  states  that 
differ in their affinity for Ca2+ [80]. It is possible that the 
interaction between SERCA and p53 favors the transition 
between these two states, which is less efficient in the 
absence of p53. Alternatively, this bimodal distribution 
may simply reflect the dynamic changes in intracellular 
calcium that are known to occur during the cell division 
cycle, in which case the effect of p53 on SERCA would be 
indirect. Additional investigation is needed to determine 
how the regulation of p53 affects SERCA at the single-
cell level.

The maintenance of tissue homeostasis by the p53 
pathway  involves  the  concerted  activities  of  numerous 
upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Arguably, 
the full complexity of this expansive signaling network 
is unlikely to be captured by any single model system. 
Complementary studies of different in vitro and in vivo 

93

models,  including  the  immortalized  system  described 
here, will undoubtably be needed to form a more complete 
understanding of p53-mediated tumor suppression. To our 
knowledge the genes identified in this study, ALDH3A1 
and  NECTIN4,  have  not  previously  been  described  as 
direct targets of p53. While prior studies have identified 
p53 binding sites in and around these loci, we explicitly 
demonstrate that ALDH3A1 and NECTIN4 transcripts can 
be induced in a p53-dependent manner and suppressed by 
a dominant-negative p53 variant. We find it interesting 
that  the  extent  of  dominant-negative  inhibition  varied 
among different target loci. While MDM2 expression was 
only partially suppressed in TP53+/A276P cells, ALDH3A1 
appeared  to  be  completely  inhibited  by  p53A276P.  More 
study  will  be  needed  to  definitively  validate  the  p53-
responsiveness  of  these  specific  promoter  elements 
in  vitro,  to  understand  why  distinct  promoters  are 
differentially  affected  by  different  p53  mutants,  and  to 
determine  the  in  vivo  context  in  which  the  regulation 
of  these  genes  by  p53  might  be  relevant  to  health  and 
disease.

ALDH3A1  and  NECTIN4  have  been  previously 
linked  to  cancer  pathogenesis.  Like  other  members  of 
the  aldehyde  dehydrogenase  superfamily,  ALDH3A1 
is  a  multifunctional  protein  that  plays  a  cytoprotective 
role  under  conditions  of  oxidative  stress  [60,  81].  A 
recent  study  has  associated  ALDH3A1  expression  with 
lung cancer metastasis and poor prognosis [82], perhaps 
challenging its presumed role in homeostasis. NECTIN4 is 
involved in forming adherens junctions that connect cells 
to one another and to the extracellular matrix [62, 83]. In 
addition, NECTIN4 acts as a stimulatory co-receptor for 
the feedback inhibition of SOCS1 in the JAK2–STAT5a 
signaling  pathway  [84].  Expressed  at  low  levels  in  a 
variety  of  normal  tissues,  NECTIN4  is  tumor  surface 
antigen  that  is  highly  expressed  in  subsets  of  breast, 
lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, and in a majority 
of urothelial cancers. Notably, NECTIN4 is the target of 
the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) enfortumab vedotin, 
which was USFDA-approved in 2019 for patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma [85, 
86]. Further exploration of ALDH3A1 and NECTIN4 and 
their  regulation  by  p53  could  yield  useful  insights  into 
the potential roles in tumorigenesis and/or rational drug 
combinations.

the  disruption  of  TP53  exon  7,  an 
oligonucleotide  duplex  encoding  the  CRISPR  guide 
sequence  5-GCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGG-3  was 
directly  cloned  into  the  plasmid  vector  pSpCas9(BB)-
2A-Puro  (pX459)  V2.0,  a  gift  from  Feng  Zhang 
(Addgene  #62988).  The 
resulting  plasmid  was 
introduced  into  hTERT-RPE1  by  transfection  with 
Scientific). 
Lipofectamine 
Following  4  d  of  selection  in  2  µg/ml  puromycin,  the 
remaining  cells  were  plated  to  limiting  dilution  in 
96-well  plates.  Individual  subclones  were  expanded 
and  screened  by  PCR,  using  the  forward  primer 
5′-CTCCTAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGT-3′ and the reverse 
primer 
5′-AAACTGAGTGGGAGCAGTAAGG-3′. 
Genetic disruption of both alleles was assessed by Sanger 
sequencing  followed  by  analysis  with  Inference  of 
CRISPR Edits software (Synthego). The deletion of TP53 
exon  1  was  accomplished  by  a  similar  approach.  The 
flanking  guides  5′-TAGTATCTACGGCACCAGGT-3′ 
and 
were 
5′-TCAGCTCGGGAAAATCGCTG-3′ 
designed  to  create  a  385  bp  deletion  that  included  the 
entire  exon.  The  expected  deletion  was  identified  in 
multiple  subclones  by  PCR  with  the  forward  primer 
5′-CTCCAAAATGATTTCCACCAAT-3′ and the reverse 
5′-ACTTTGAGTTCGGATGGTCCTA-3′.

Western blots, antibodies and cell fractionation

Protein lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Cell 
Signal Technologies), resolved on Bolt Bis-Tris minigels 
(ThermoFisher  Scientific)  and  transferred  to  PVDF 
membranes (MilliporeSigma). Antibodies for the detection 
of p53 (DO-1) and MDM2 (SMP14) were obtained from 
Santa  Cruz  Biotechnology. Antibodies  against  p21WAF1/
CIP1  (12D1)  and  H3K9me3  (D4W1U)  phospho-Chk2 
(T68,  polyclonal),  phospho-p53  (S15,  16G8),  HSP90 
(C45G5), ERp72 (D70D12) and histone H3 (D1H2) were 
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The isolation 
of ubiquitinated proteins was performed with the Signal-
Seeker  Ubiquitin  Enrichment  kit  (Cytoskeleton).  Cell 
fractionation  was  performed  with  the  Qproteome  Cell 
Compartment kit (Qiagen).

Glutaraldehyde crosslinking

Multimeric  forms  of  p53  were  stabilized  by 
glutaraldehyde  crosslinking,  as  previously  described 
[88].  Briefly,  cells  were  lysed  with  a  buffer  containing 
0.5% NP-40 substitute. Lysates were brought to a final 
concentration of glutaraldehyde of 0.01% or 0.02% and 
incubated  on  ice  for  20  min. The  crosslinking  reaction 
was stopped with 1X Bolt sample buffer (ThermoFisher 
Scientific)  and  proteins  were 
resolved  by  gel 
electrophoresis followed by a western blot, as described 
above.

Drug treatments

The MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a and the proteasome 
inhibitor  MG-132  were  purchased  from  Enzo  Life 
Sciences,  dissolved  in  DMSO  and  used  at  final 
concentrations  of  10  µM  and  20  µM  respectively.  The 
SERCA  inhibitor  thapsigargin  and  doxorubicin  were 
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and dissolved 
in  DMSO.  Cycloheximide,  used  for  the  assessment  of 
protein stability, was purchased as a ready-made solution 
(Sigma  Aldrich)  and  used  at  a  final  concentration  of 
100 µg/ml. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was 
also obtained from Sigma Aldrich, dissolved in ethanol, 
and used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml.

Clonogenic survival assay

For the assessment of clonogenic survival following 
irradiation,  500–1500  cells  were  plated  to  10  cm  cell 
culture dishes in triplicate. Following a 16–20 h incubation 
to allow cell attachment, plates were exposed to measured 
doses of X-rays delivered with a MuliRad225 (Faxitron) 
and  returned  to  the  incubator  for  14  d.  Colonies  were 
fixed and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in methanol, 
and colonies containing >50 cells were counted on a plate 
scanner (Interscience).

Imaging of subcellular Ca2+

Cells were transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3_
erGAP2  (a  gift  from  Teresa Alonso  and  Javier  García-
Sancho, Addgene #78120), which encodes a low affinity 
fluorescent calcium biosensor, based on a GFP-aequorin 
fusion  protein  (GAP),  targeted  to  the  ER.  A  similar 
plasmid, pcDNA3_nucGAP (a gift from Teresa Alonso, 
Addgene  #78736)  was  used  to  assess  nuclear  Ca2+. 
Dual-excitation  imaging  of  GAP-expressing  cells  were 
performed on a fluorescent microscope equipped with 403 
and 470 nm excitation filters.

Analysis of gene expression

The  induction  of  p53  target  genes  was  assessed 
by  quantitative  reverse  transcription  PCR  (RT-qPCR). 
Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  subconfluent  cells  with 
the Monarch total RNA purification kit (NEB). Reverse 
transcription and PCR amplification were performed with 
the Luna One-Step RT-qPCR kit (NEB). Real time PCR 
amplification was performed on a BioRad CFX96 Real-
Time PCR detection system using the primer sets listed 
in Table 2. RT-qPCR results were cross-referenced with 
publicly available p53 binding data, as described below.

RNA-seq analysis

Total RNA was extracted from each cell line, either 
untreated or following treatment with 10 µM nutlin-3a. 
Poly(A)  selection,  library  preparation  and  2  ×  150  bp 
Illumina  sequencing  were  performed  by  Azenta  Life 
Sciences.  A  total  of  462,496,793  reads  encompassing 
138,751 Mb were obtained from the six samples (single 
replicates of each). Reads were imported into Geneious 
Prime (Version 2020.0) for processing. Reads were first 

paired and trimmed with BBDuk, then mapped to Hg38 
with the Geneious RNA Mapper. For the calculation of 
normalized  expression  levels  in  transcripts  per  million, 
ambiguously  mapped  reads  were  counted  as  partial 
matches.  Differential  expression  between  samples  was 
determined in a pairwise fashion using the median of gene 
expression ratios, as described [89]. The normalized read 
counts  across  samples  were  used  to  generate  z-scores 
for each row. Genes that met the specified criteria were 
clustered  by  the  complete  linkage  method  using  the 
Heatmapper  online  application  (http://heatmapper.ca/
expression/). Distance between rows was measured by the 
Spearman Rank Correlation.

Analysis of genomic regulatory elements

Histone  H3K27Ac  and  ChIP-seq  ReMap  data 
sets generated by the ENCODE consortium [5] and Cap 
Analysis  of  Gene  Expression  (CAGE)  data  generated 
by the FANTOM5 consortium [90] were visualized with 
the BLAST-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) on the UCSC 
Genome  Browser.  ReMap  is  a  comprehensive  resource 
that aggregates transcription factor binding sites from a 
wide array of publicly available ChIP-seq experiments. 
The  pipeline  used  by  ReMap  is  designed  to  uniformly 
process  and  annotate  ChIP-seq  data  across  multiple 
datasets.  The  experiments  that  assessed  p53  binding 
included two conditions: human cells treated with nutlin 
and untreated controls. Trimmed sequencing reads were 
typically  aligned  to  the  human  reference  genome  hg38 
using Bowtie2. Significant peaks representing prospective 
p53 binding sites were identified using MACS2 with an 
FDR  threshold  of  0.01.  Peaks  were  compared  between 
treated  and  untreated  conditions  to  identify  differential 
binding  sites;  DESeq2  was  employed  for  statistical 
analysis.
