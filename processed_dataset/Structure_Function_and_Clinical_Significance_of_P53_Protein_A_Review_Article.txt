In cancer biology, p53 holds an elevated position because high mutation rates in the TP53 gene across human cancers lead to abnormal p53 protein. This would allow limitless replication of genetically damaged cells with malignant potential and so facilitate tumorigenesis. Normally referred to as the "guardian of the genome," this protein assumes a central role in different cellular functions spanning metabolism through cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis to DNA repair mechanisms. Its significance extends beyond tumor suppression because it controls metabolic pathways that are central to maintaining homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. The normal functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor are abrogated by mutations; indeed, many such mutant forms act as oncogenes themselves when expressed in cancer cells. The review paper presents information from recent scientific investigations on the chemical structure of p53 protein and its mutations with a discussion on implications for cancer treatment. It also integrates various research findings to clarify the clinical effects of the p53 gene, especially in breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and looks into changing treatment plans that focus on p53 problems. The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, a central tumor suppressor in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Biology of cancer cannot overemphasize the importance of p53 since mutation of the TP53 gene is among the most frequent in human cancers resulting in abnormal forms of the p53 protein. The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, a vital tumor suppressor central to the maintenance of genomic integrity . The "guardian of the genome" as frequently termed, p53 regulates all major cellular events that could possibly relate to the metabolism cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair under normal conditions . Its role is important in cancer biology; mutation to the TP53 gene is among the most common genetic changes found in human cancers and typically results into abnormal dysfunctional forms of the p53 protein that cannot block uncontrolled cellular growth and genomic instability . Challenges in p53 therapy remain despite an evolution in knowledge regarding the chemistry of p53 and mutations. Complex structures and variations of mutant forms add to treatment difficulties. Wang et al. (2023) note structural information on p53 is crucial for designing drugs aimed at correcting mutant p53 or increasing the function of normal-type p53 Protein. Although progress has been made in understanding both the structure and functions of p53, several knowledge gaps still exist. Studies should be more specifically focused on how different mutations induce particular structural changes and their significance for altered interactions of p53 at a molecular level (Shafey, 2020). Further studies would have increased scope if they centered on post-translational changes to the chemical structure of the protein and their consequences for its action relating to cancer . Some of the gaps in knowledge that remain notwithstanding the advances in understanding p53’s role in metabolic regulation include which specific metabolic pathways are targeted by p53 and how p53 mutations cause metabolic dysregulation. Also, while existing research highlights therapeutic targeting of p53 as a strategy, its treatment efficacy in clinical settings remains largely untested . Despite significant strides in decoding the p53 gene's clinical relevance, numerous knowledge lacunae persist. More light needs to be shed on the mutant p53 interactions with other cellular pathway components for better-informed therapeutic interventions. Also, due to heterogeneity in the p53 mutation spectrum and variation in cancer type and individual tumor, therapy has to be highly adaptive (Cuthbert & Insel, 2010). IJHMR, Volume 0 4 Issue 50 220 May 5 Page 309 Structure, Function and Clinical Significance of P53 Protein: A Review Article STRUCTURE OF P53 The TP53 gene provides instructions for making the p53 protein, which is a very important tumor suppressor. The p53 protein works to keep the genome stable by controlling key cell activities. It performs a central function in cell cycle regulation such that no cells with broken DNA continue to divide (Piunti & Shilatifard, 2016). Where damage to the DNA is great and the normal cellular mechanisms for repair do not correct the damage, p53 may initiate apoptosis and remove these pre-cancerous cells. It also helps in DNA repair signaling under different stress conditions in the cell. Mutations of TP53 are among those most frequently observed across human cancers and typically abrogate the normal protective functions of p53 (Egli & Manoharan, 2023). The role of p53 in regulating metabolic homeostasis is newly emerging with multi-pronged aspects. For example, Hu et al. (2010) showed that p53 directly influences metabolism by identifying Glutaminase 2 as a new target gene of p53 involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant function. Fischer (2017) complement this finding by listing 3,661 direct target genes of p53, a significant number of which are involved in vital metabolic activities further underlining the importance of p53 in metabolism at the cellular level. It has also been explained that Zhang et al.’s work in 2011 revealed to us another pathway through which Parkin mediates the role of p53 on glucose metabolism and Warburg effects. This connection is very important since it illustrates how abnormal regulation due to mutation in p53 leads to cancer progression via disturbed normal metabolic regulation; this abnormality highlighted by its description through increased glycolysis within cancer cells . BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF P53 Research shows that the structural validity of p53 is very important for its activity as a transcription factor. Different mutations may assault the p53 protein and abolish its tumor-suppressing functions and, sometimes, even activate oncogenic properties. These changes affect how well the protein can attach to DNA and turn on target genes that fundamentally control tumor development. Studies have focused on the chemical structure of p53, its domains, and the consequences of specific mutations to play better insight into cancer . Guo et al. (2010) carried out molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the α-helical structural stability of stapled p53 peptides, revealing how p53 modifications might affect its structural and functional attributes. Structural studies like this one are critical for understanding how various mutations may change or alter p53's binding to DNA, as well as to other proteins in the pathway of tumorigenesis. The large TP53 mutation database reflects the diversity of p53 changes seen in tumors of varied types. Wang et al. (2023) stress that a full understanding of structure-function links in p53 is key to creating good treatments for TP53 mutation-harboring cancers. The review paper underlines that mutation-specific structural consequences determine the ultimate functional outcome of p53 in cellular settings. Work by Hu et al., 2021, helps explain how mutations in TP53 result in abnormal, oncogenic p53 proteins and discusses approaches to target mutant p53 directly or indirectly to reestablish normal cellular function. This piece emphasizes the crucial interface between knowledge regarding the chemical makeup of the p53 protein and cancer treatment design. The p53 protein participates in varied cellular processes, acting on DNA repair, apoptosis, and the regulation of the cell cycle. In most cases, mutations of the TP53 gene result in abnormal p53 protein(s) that mediates tumor progression and resistance against treatment (Oren & Rotter, 2010). Such mutations can manifest oncogenic gain-of-function activities that add another layer of complexity to therapeutically targeting mutation in p53 since the mutation promotes cancer formation rather than suppressing it . Recent studies highlight the double role of mutant p53 in interfering with normal p53 function and in supporting tumor formation. For example, the results of Bykov et al. (2017) show that targeting mutant p53 could bring very good therapeutic results. They point out the possibility of small-molecule compounds meant to bring back the normal function of p53 or to take advantage of the weaknesses of tumors having these mutations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Mutations of TP53 that were also mutated in other cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) was described by Fearon (2011). Metabolic regulation by p53 was deranged due to its mutations; however, its contribution is the most robust toward malignancy in CRC. The pathology intrinsically designed itself with altered metabolic pathways that allowed tumors to grow and provided nourishment. Hence, such changes raise the need for further exploration of how genetic mutations of p53 affect metabolic regulation. Apoptosis, as well as metabolism-related signaling by p53 previously discussed by Aubrey et al., (2017) resulted in explaining tumor suppression through apoptosis induced by p53. Mechanisms of apoptosis mediated by p53 are absolutely crucial for understanding the normal functions of metabolism under this protein. Ou et al. (2016) further connected the relationship between p53 activation and polyamine metabolism linking ferroptotic responses mediated by p53 to metabolic regulation hence providing one with new avenues on metabolism influenced by p53. Given its central role in metabolic regulation, targeting p53 pathways presents a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Bykov et al. (2017) discussed strategies for targeting mutant p53 to restore normal function. In other words, therapeutic interventions could potentially re-establish metabolic homeostasis in cancer cells. This is exactly what Hassin and Oren (2022) found who outline the IJHMR, Volume 0 4 Issue 50 220 May 5 Page 310 Structure, Function and Clinical Significance of P53 Protein: A Review Article numerous therapeutic targets related to the p53 protein, hence implying a very strong potential for the development of p53-targeted therapies aimed at restoring its normal metabolic functions. Wang et al. (2023) highlighted advances in targeting p53 pathways and stressed that there is a need for much better understanding structural mechanisms involved. In turn, that means more elucidation leading to new therapies helping to sort out dysregulated metabolism rooted in mutations of p53. The clinical relevance of p53 mutation is also manifested in breast cancer and MDS. In breast cancer, this is reported with the loss of 53BP1 previously associated only with BRCA1 mutations thus revealing a possible target for therapy aimed at restoring DNA repair mechanisms . This stands to be most critical within triple-negative breast cancer and BRCA-associated subtypes wherein the expression of 53BP1 is weak. Such populations, therefore, demand an introduction of strategies that enhance the functionality of p53 or its pathways for better patient outcomes . MDS the prognostic implication of TP53 allelic state, monoallelic or biallelic. Bernard et al., (2019) said that knowledge of mutation in TP53 can lead to personalized treatment strategies that will guide therapeutic decisions and improve management of patients. It underscores the imperative need for integration of TP53 status into clinical decision-making frameworks for hematological malignancies. . The unpredictably mutated nature of p53 makes it very hard for scientists to select appropriate, effective treatment options. Sabapathy and Lane (2018) further this by stating that targeted therapy against p53 is still under development and not all mutants are equal, hence the need for individualized strategies of treatment. Small molecules gene therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches are promising avenues for restoring p53 function or directly targeting its mutant forms . Gendicine, an anti-p53 gene therapy product, has already proven clinically effective in the treatment of cancers. Marei et al. (2021) call on improved treatment outcomes based on its integration with conventional treatments. This is another indicator that periodic research is highly needed. CONCLUSION p53 as a tumor suppressor protein is greatly defined by the chemical structure of it. Targeted therapies for cancer patients need to be developed based on an understanding of structural impacts TP53 mutations bring about. Research with a focus on p53 biology will pave, in no small measure, pathways to innovative therapeutic techniques capable of restoring lost p53 functions in cancer patients. Metabolic control is strongly regulated by the p53 gene and its mutations in metabolic pathways are involved in the initiation and progression of many types of cancer. This calls for a better comprehension of how p53 works under normal metabolism and what happens when its function is perturbed since this would open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. As comprehension grows and fresh remedial tactics develop, aiming at p53 flaw instills hope for bettering healing results among different cancers. Ongoing study is crucial to fill current info voids and to polish cures geared toward fixing p53 working order or taking advantage of weak spots in growths having p53 changes.
