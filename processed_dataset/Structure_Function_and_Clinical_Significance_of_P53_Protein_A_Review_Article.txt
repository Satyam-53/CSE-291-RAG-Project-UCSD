ABSTRACT: The TP53 gene encodes the critical tumor suppressor p53, which is involved in the regulation of cell cycle control, 
apoptosis, and genomic stability. In cancer biology, p53 holds an elevated position because high mutation rates in the TP53 gene 
across  human  cancers  lead  to  abnormal  p53  protein.  This  would  allow  limitless  replication  of  genetically  damaged  cells  with 
malignant potential and so facilitate tumorigenesis. Normally referred to as the "guardian of the genome," this protein assumes a 
central  role  in  different  cellular  functions  spanning  metabolism  through  cell  cycle  checkpoints  and  apoptosis  to  DNA  repair 
mechanisms.  Its  significance  extends  beyond  tumor  suppression  because  it  controls  metabolic  pathways  that  are  central  to 
maintaining homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. The normal functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor are abrogated 
by  mutations; indeed,  many  such  mutant  forms act as oncogenes themselves  when expressed in cancer cells. The review paper 
presents information from recent scientific investigations on the chemical structure of p53 protein and its mutations with a discussion 
on  implications  for  cancer  treatment.  It  also  integrates  various  research  findings  to  clarify  the  clinical  effects  of  the  p53  gene, 
especially  in  breast  cancer  and  myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS),  and  looks  into  changing  treatment  plans  that  focus  on  p53 
problems. 

INTRODUCTION 
The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, a central tumor suppressor in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Biology 
of  cancer  cannot  overemphasize  the  importance  of  p53  since  mutation  of  the TP53  gene  is  among  the  most  frequent  in  human 
cancers resulting in abnormal forms of the p53 protein. The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, a vital tumor suppressor central to 
the maintenance of genomic integrity (Ahn et al., 2014). The "guardian of the genome" as frequently termed, p53 regulates all major 
cellular events that could possibly relate to the metabolism cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair under normal conditions (Surget et al., 
2013). Its role is important in cancer biology; mutation to the TP53 gene is among the most common genetic changes found in 
human cancers and typically results into abnormal dysfunctional forms of the p53 protein that cannot block uncontrolled cellular 
growth and genomic instability (Bugge et al., 2012). 
Challenges  in  p53  therapy  remain  despite  an  evolution  in  knowledge  regarding  the  chemistry  of  p53  and  mutations.  Complex 
structures and variations of  mutant forms add to treatment  difficulties. Wang et al. (2023) note structural information  on p53 is 
crucial for designing drugs aimed at correcting mutant p53 or increasing the function of normal-type p53 Protein. Although progress 
has been made in understanding both the structure and functions of p53, several knowledge gaps still exist. Studies should be more 
specifically focused on how different mutations induce particular structural changes and their significance for altered interactions 
of p53 at a molecular level (Shafey, 2020). Further studies would have increased scope if they centered on post-translational changes 
to the chemical structure of the protein and their consequences for its action relating to cancer (Łukasiewicz et al., 2021). 
Some of the gaps in knowledge that remain notwithstanding the advances in understanding p53’s role in metabolic regulation include 
which specific metabolic pathways are targeted by p53 and how p53 mutations cause metabolic dysregulation. Also, while existing 
research  highlights  therapeutic  targeting  of  p53  as  a  strategy,  its  treatment  efficacy  in  clinical  settings  remains  largely  untested 
(Oerum et al., 2021). Despite significant strides in decoding the p53 gene's clinical relevance, numerous knowledge lacunae persist. 
More light needs to be shed on the mutant p53 interactions with other cellular pathway components for better-informed therapeutic 
interventions. Also, due to heterogeneity in the p53 mutation spectrum and variation in cancer type and individual tumor, therapy 
has to be highly adaptive (Cuthbert & Insel, 2010).

Structure, Function and Clinical Significance of P53 Protein: A Review Article 

STRUCTURE OF P53  
The TP53 gene provides instructions for making the p53 protein, which is a very important tumor suppressor. The p53 protein works 
to keep the genome stable by controlling key cell activities. It performs a central function in cell cycle regulation such that no cells 
with  broken  DNA  continue  to  divide  (Piunti  &  Shilatifard,  2016). Where  damage  to  the  DNA  is  great  and  the  normal  cellular 
mechanisms for repair do not correct the damage, p53 may initiate apoptosis and remove these pre-cancerous cells. It also helps in 
DNA repair signaling under different stress conditions in the cell. Mutations of TP53 are among those most frequently observed 
across human cancers and typically abrogate the normal protective functions of p53 (Egli & Manoharan, 2023). 
The role of p53 in regulating metabolic homeostasis is newly emerging with multi-pronged aspects. For example, Hu et al. (2010) 
showed that p53 directly influences metabolism by identifying Glutaminase 2 as a new target gene of p53 involved in the regulation 
of energy metabolism and antioxidant function. Fischer (2017) complement this finding by listing 3,661 direct target genes of p53, 
a significant number of which are involved in vital metabolic activities further underlining the importance of p53 in metabolism at 
the cellular level. It has also been explained that Zhang et al.’s work in 2011 revealed to us another pathway through which Parkin 
mediates the role of p53 on glucose  metabolism and Warburg effects. This connection is very important since it illustrates how 
abnormal regulation due to mutation in p53 leads to cancer progression via disturbed normal metabolic regulation; this abnormality 
highlighted by its description through increased glycolysis within cancer cells (Hafner et al., 2019). 

BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF P53  
Research shows that the structural validity of p53 is very important for its activity as a transcription factor. Different mutations may 
assault  the  p53  protein  and  abolish  its  tumor-suppressing  functions  and,  sometimes,  even  activate  oncogenic  properties.  These 
changes affect how well the protein can attach to DNA and turn on target genes that fundamentally control tumor development. 
Studies have focused on the chemical structure of p53, its domains, and the consequences of specific mutations to play better insight 
into cancer (Wang et al., 2023). 
Guo et al. (2010) carried out molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the α-helical structural stability of stapled p53 peptides, 
revealing how p53 modifications might affect its structural and functional attributes. Structural studies like this one are critical for 
understanding how various mutations may change or alter p53's binding to DNA, as well as to other proteins in the pathway of 
tumorigenesis. 
The large TP53 mutation database reflects the diversity of p53 changes seen in tumors of varied types. Wang et al. (2023) stress that 
a full understanding of structure-function links in p53 is key to creating good treatments for TP53 mutation-harboring cancers. The 
review paper underlines that mutation-specific structural consequences determine the ultimate functional outcome of p53 in cellular 
settings. Work by Hu et al., 2021, helps explain how mutations in TP53 result in abnormal, oncogenic p53 proteins and discusses 
approaches to target  mutant p53 directly or indirectly to reestablish normal cellular function. This piece emphasizes the crucial 
interface between knowledge regarding the chemical makeup of the p53 protein and cancer treatment design. 
The p53 protein participates in varied cellular processes, acting on DNA repair, apoptosis, and the regulation of the cell cycle. In 
most cases, mutations of the TP53 gene result in abnormal p53 protein(s) that mediates tumor progression and resistance against 
treatment  (Oren  &  Rotter,  2010).  Such  mutations  can  manifest  oncogenic  gain-of-function  activities  that  add  another  layer  of 
complexity to therapeutically targeting mutation in p53 since the mutation promotes cancer formation rather than suppressing  it 
(Laganà et al.,2019). 
Recent studies highlight the double role of mutant p53 in interfering with normal p53 function and in supporting tumor formation. 
For example, the results of Bykov et al. (2017) show that targeting mutant p53 could bring very good therapeutic results. They point 
out  the  possibility  of  small-molecule  compounds  meant  to  bring  back  the  normal  function  of  p53  or  to  take  advantage  of  the 
weaknesses of tumors having these mutations. 

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
Mutations of TP53 that were also mutated in other cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) was described by Fearon (2011). Metabolic 
regulation by p53 was deranged due to its mutations; however, its contribution is the most robust toward malignancy in CRC. The 
pathology intrinsically designed itself  with altered  metabolic pathways that allowed tumors to grow and provided nourishment. 
Hence, such changes raise the need for further exploration of how genetic mutations of p53 affect metabolic regulation. Apoptosis, 
as  well  as  metabolism-related  signaling  by  p53  previously  discussed  by  Aubrey  et  al.,    (2017)  resulted  in  explaining  tumor 
suppression through apoptosis induced by p53. Mechanisms of apoptosis mediated by p53 are absolutely crucial for understanding 
the normal functions of metabolism under this protein. Ou et al. (2016) further connected the relationship between p53 activation 
and polyamine metabolism linking ferroptotic responses mediated by p53 to metabolic regulation hence providing one with new 
avenues on metabolism influenced by p53. 
Given its central role in metabolic regulation, targeting p53 pathways presents a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Bykov et al. 
(2017)  discussed  strategies  for  targeting  mutant  p53  to  restore  normal  function.  In  other  words,  therapeutic  interventions  could 
potentially re-establish metabolic homeostasis in cancer cells. This is exactly what Hassin and Oren (2022) found who outline the

Structure, Function and Clinical Significance of P53 Protein: A Review Article 

numerous therapeutic targets related to the p53 protein, hence implying a very strong potential for the development of p53-targeted 
therapies aimed at restoring its normal metabolic functions. Wang et al. (2023) highlighted advances in targeting p53 pathways and 
stressed that there is a need for much better understanding structural mechanisms involved. In turn, that means more elucidation 
leading to new therapies helping to sort out dysregulated metabolism rooted in mutations of p53. 
The clinical relevance of p53 mutation is also manifested in breast cancer and MDS. In breast cancer, this is reported with the loss 
of 53BP1 previously associated only with BRCA1 mutations thus revealing a possible target for therapy aimed at restoring DNA 
repair mechanisms (Bouwman et al., 2010). This stands to be most critical within triple-negative breast cancer and BRCA-associated 
subtypes wherein the expression of 53BP1 is weak. Such populations, therefore, demand an introduction of strategies that enhance 
the functionality of p53 or its pathways for better patient outcomes (Leroy et al., 2014). 
MDS the prognostic implication of TP53 allelic state, monoallelic or biallelic. Bernard et al., (2019) said that knowledge of mutation 
in TP53 can lead to personalized treatment strategies that will guide therapeutic decisions and improve management of patients. It 
underscores  the  imperative  need  for  integration  of  TP53  status  into  clinical  decision-making  frameworks  for  hematological 
malignancies. (Li et al., 2015). 
The  unpredictably  mutated  nature  of  p53  makes  it  very  hard  for  scientists  to  select  appropriate,  effective  treatment  options. 
Sabapathy and Lane (2018) further this by stating that targeted therapy against p53 is still under development and not all mutants 
are  equal,  hence  the  need  for  individualized  strategies  of  treatment.  Small  molecules  gene  therapies  and  immunotherapeutic 
approaches are promising avenues for restoring p53 function or directly targeting its mutant forms (Wang et al., 2023). Gendicine, 
an anti-p53 gene therapy product, has already proven clinically effective in the treatment of cancers. Marei et al. (2021) call on 
improved treatment outcomes based on its integration with conventional treatments. This is another indicator that periodic research 
is highly needed. 

CONCLUSION 
p53 as a tumor suppressor protein is greatly defined by the chemical structure of it. Targeted therapies for cancer patients need to be 
developed based on an understanding of structural impacts TP53 mutations bring about. Research with a focus on p53 biology will 
pave, in no small measure, pathways to innovative therapeutic techniques capable of restoring lost p53 functions in cancer patients. 
Metabolic control is strongly regulated by the p53 gene and its mutations in metabolic pathways are involved in the initiation and 
progression of many types of cancer. This calls for a better comprehension of how p53 works under normal metabolism and what 
happens when its function is perturbed since this would open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. As comprehension grows 
and fresh remedial tactics develop, aiming at p53 flaw instills hope for bettering healing results among different cancers. Ongoing 
study is crucial to fill current info voids and to polish cures geared toward fixing p53 working order or taking advantage of weak 
spots in growths having p53 changes.
