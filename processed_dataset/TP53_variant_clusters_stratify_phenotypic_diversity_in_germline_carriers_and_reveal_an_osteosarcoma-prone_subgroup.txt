Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) has recently been redeﬁned as a ‘spectrum’ can-
cer predisposition disorder to reﬂect its broad phenotypic heterogeneity. This
variability is thought to stem in part from the diverse functional impacts of
TP53 variants, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood
and there is an unmet clinical need for effective risk stratiﬁcation. Here, we
apply unsupervised clustering to functional datasets and identify distinct TP53
variant groups with clinical relevance, including a monomeric subgroup
enriched in osteosarcoma cases. In cellular validation assays, dermal ﬁbro-
blasts from carriers of more functionally impaired variants exhibit increased
metabolic growth rates, mirroring trends observed in cluster-stratiﬁed clinical
outcomes. These ﬁndings demonstrate the feasibility of developing diagnostic
assays to guide personalized cancer risk assessment. More broadly, our results
show that nuances in TP53 dysfunction shape the germline TP53-related cancer
susceptibility spectrum and provide a framework for functionally delineating
variant carriers.

Inherited cancer susceptibility in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS; MIM
#151623) was ﬁrst described in 1969 based on the observation of sev-
eral families with a high incidence of rare and diverse cancer types1.
Since this initial observation, germline TP53 variants were identiﬁed as
the underlying cause of LFS2,3 and the clinical classiﬁcation has been
adapted by multiple revised sets of criteria4–7 to incorporate indivi-
duals who do not ﬁt the strict ‘classic LFS’ diagnosis8. Recently, LFS was
reclassiﬁed as a ‘spectrum’ of disease rather than a syndrome to reﬂect
the heterogeneity that has become increasingly evident through
genotype-phenotype association studies9. The LFS spectrum encom-
passes a highly variable age-of-onset with nearly 30% affected during

childhood, largely unpredictable sites of tumor manifestation, and
inconsistent cancer penetrance. To date, the factors causing this het-
erogeneity in LFS remain unclear, although unequal TP53 variant
functional consequences have been linked to different cancer
phenotypes10–12.

Increased use of DNA sequencing in the clinic has led to the dis-
covery of hundreds of germline variants that span the entire TP53 gene.
Missense mutations leading to single amino acid changes represent
the vast majority of TP53 variants that are associated with LFS. There
are thousands of possible single amino acid substitutions in TP53, and
currently, at least 1,703 different germline variants have been linked to

individuals with cancer, as catalogued by the National Cancer Insti-
tute’s (NCI) TP53 Database (https://tp53.isb-cgc.org). However,
research efforts have focused on variants at a few “hotspot” residues
that account for only 30% of germline TP53 missense variants found in
patients, leaving the majority largely uncharacterized and many still
considered variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS). Therefore, it is of
great interest to classify all variants in order to provide more accurate
cancer risk assessments with tailored surveillance strategies and
treatment plans.

Mutagenesis studies are an important clinical tool used to assess
TP53 variant pathogenicity, however, it is often unclear without sub-
stantial clinical evidence that is difﬁcult to obtain from predominantly
rare and infrequent variants. The results from large-scale mutagenesis
experiments have demonstrated a broad range of functional con-
sequences associated with different variants, ranging from near wild-
type (WT) TP53 capabilities to severe loss-of-function (LOF)13–15. As a
multifaceted protein, TP53 is composed of several domains containing
complex structured and unstructured regions that enable a myriad of
cellular tasks. Primarily operating as a transcription factor, TP53 binds
to DNA recognition sequences as a tetramer and regulates the
expression of several thousand target genes to orchestrate cellular
responses centering around DNA-damage repair (DDR) and cell fate
decisions16. Hence, variants arising at different locations of the protein
can impart different cellular consequences by altering its transcrip-
tional activity (TA) as well as its non-TA. Some variant TP53 species can
also exert a dominant-negative (DN) effect over WT TP5317,18. This is an
important feature because LFS and germline TP53-related cancer pre-
disposition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and
most patients are heterozygous carriers who retain one copy of WT
TP53. Moreover, TP53 variant LOF can vary under different cellular
conditions. For example, the R337H variant—the most frequently
reported germline variant due to a genetic founder event in Brazil—has

a conditional pH-dependent LOF and is associated with the tissue-
speciﬁc development of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)19,20. Thus, the
functional assessments derived from comprehensive variant library
screens conducted in varying cellular contexts provide clinically rele-
vant measurements of speciﬁc TP53 activities.

Here, we incorporated TP53 variant library screens using an
unsupervised cluster analysis and uncovered ﬁve functionally distinct
variant clusters (Fig. 1). When applied to germline variant carriers from
the NCI TP53 Database and a validation dataset, we identiﬁed unique
cancer patterns and signiﬁcant differences between ages at cancer
diagnosis. Additionally, assessment of variants in cancer cell lines and
primary patient-derived healthy skin and blood samples recapitulated
the clinical observations. Our variant clustering model provides a
classiﬁcation tool for the risk stratiﬁcation and consideration for var-
iant interpretation of TP53 variant carriers.

Results
Unsupervised learning identiﬁes ﬁve clusters of TP53 variants
based on cellular functional features
Various functional features of TP53 have been evaluated using TP53
saturation mutagenesis screens conducted with different cellular sys-
tems and drug treatments. These features include TA, DN activity, LOF,
DDR, and proliferation13–15. Each study has independently reported a
wide-ranging functional gradient using separate variant libraries. In a
preliminary analysis, we compared the results of these large-scale
assays and observed weak to moderately strong inter-assay correla-
tions (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). We found that the corre-
lations were inﬂuenced by the variant locations by examining the assay
results in relation to the resident functional domains. Strong correla-
tions were observed between variants within the DNA-binding domain
(DBD), which displayed a broad gradient of functionality across the
assays. In contrast, these relationships were weak or absent for

C-terminal domain (CTD) variants, in which most scores indicate the
retention of all functional activities with little diversity. Variants in the
N-terminal domain (NTD) and oligomerization domain (OD) exhibited
a functional gradient similar to DBD variants, showing weak to mod-
erate linear relationships when comparing between LOF, DDR, and TA.
However, DN activity was predominantly restricted to DBD variants.
These ﬁndings highlight the phenotypic array and domain-speciﬁc
features of TP53 variants, prompting the integration of multiple assays
to better capture the complex interplay of these diverse functional
effects.

We employed a principal component analysis (PCA) for visuali-
zation and dimensionality reduction of the functional features mea-
sured by mutagenesis screens covering the TP53 protein. At least two
spatially separated clusters were visible within a clearly disjointed
distribution of data points (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Variants located in
the same domain demonstrated a tendency to cluster together, with
minimal spatial separation between domains, except for a distinct
subgroup of DBD variants (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Notably, each of
the cancer-associated hotspot variants as well as monomeric TP53
variants were grouped in close proximity, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Next, unsupervised k-means clustering was performed with
ﬁve predicted clusters (Fig. 2b) as determined by the gap statistic
method (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gap statistic was chosen because
it is a robust and subjective method that uses statistical testing to
determine the ideal number of clusters. Unlike the elbow method,
which relies on visual identiﬁcation of an inﬂection point, and the
silhouette method, which can be sensitive to noise or non-ideal data
distributions, the gap statistic compares the clustering structure to
that of a null model, reducing the risk of overﬁtting. To validate this
with a non-linear approach, we applied uniform manifold approxima-
tion and projection (UMAP) which demonstrated congruent results to
the PCA with a similar spatial distribution of data points with one
clearly isolated cluster of DBD variants (Fig. 2c).

TP53 variant clusters have distinct signatures affecting different
structural and functional characteristics
By mapping the clusters onto the TP53 coding sequence, we identiﬁed
unique variant signatures (Fig. 2d). First, variants in cluster 1 were
found throughout the protein and broadly coincide with intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) predicted by the IUPred3 computational
method, which are regions expected to be more tolerant to
alterations21 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, clusters 2
and 3 were centered within the highly structured DBD. We found that
cluster 3 variants were particularly enriched within helix 2 (H2) of the
loop-sheet-helix motif (L1/S/H2) that binds to the major groove of
DNA. DNA contact sites were affected most frequently in cluster 3,
although interestingly, a variety of different structural/functional ele-
ments were impacted in this cluster that also encompassed all hotspot
variants. Conversely, cluster 2 variants were primarily located in
regions distal to the DNA contact sites (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c).
Cluster 4 variants were distinctively concentrated at the CTD—another
IDR with various roles implicated in regulating TP53 activities through
post-translational modiﬁcations (Fig. 2d)22. Lastly, cluster 5 had a wide
variant distribution with three sites of markedly increased variant
frequencies located in structured regions known to impact protein
stability (Fig. 2d). These three loci were found within TAD1 (transacti-
vation domain 1), OD, and an NTD hinge region (residues 86-93)
associated with stabilizing the TP53 tetramer through its interaction
with the DBD23. Speciﬁcally, the residues affected most frequently in
cluster 5 are involved in binding to the main TP53 negative regulator
MDM2 (residues F19, W23, and L26)24, DBD stabilization (W91)23, TP53
oligomerization (I332, R337, and F341), and transactivation (F19, L22,
W23, and L26)25. Further, we found a signiﬁcant difference between the
expected frequency of proline substitutions, which tend to be more

structurally disruptive changes, when comparing between the clusters
(p < 0.0001, chi-squared test). Cluster 5 contains the most substitu-
tions involving proline, even after excluding the proline-rich region
(PRR; residues 60–90) where several cluster 5 variants are located
(Supplementary Fig. 3d). Clusters 3 and 5 both contain a higher pro-
portion of substitutions to proline compared to clusters 1, 2, and 4,
suggesting that variants in clusters 3 and 5 may confer greater struc-
tural impairments (Supplementary Fig. 3e).

Grantham’s distance score assessment reveals that cluster 3 has
signiﬁcantly higher scores than all other variant clusters (p < 0.0001,
Mann-Whitney U test, Supplementary Fig. 3f), indicating a greater
evolutionary distance and suggesting more deleterious effects for
amino acid substitutions within this cluster. Post-clustering analyses of
the functional datasets, which were used as input features for the PCA,
align with the structural evaluations, further supporting the observed
cluster distinctions. Variants in cluster 3 display the most severe
functional consequences across cellular assays, characterized by a high
degree of DN activity (Fig. 2e–h). By contrast, clusters 1 and 4 pre-
dominantly consist of variants with hypermorphic or near-WT func-
tionality, consistent with their association to IDRs. Cluster 2 variants
are hypomorphic, exhibiting partial TA, WT-like DDR, and minimal DN
potential. Lastly, cluster 5 variants show high LOF and impaired DDR,
however, most variants in this cluster retain TA and lack DN activity.

TP53 variant clusters display differing associations with cancer
The TP53 Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) plays an important role
in evaluating molecular and clinical evidence to provide variant
interpretations accessible through ClinVar (https://clinicalgenome.
org/afﬁliation/50013)26. VCEP uses variant functional
information,
including the mutagenesis assays used in our variant clustering model,
in addition to clinical and population data to determine variant
pathogenicity. However, TP53 variants can be exceedingly rare and
often lack sufﬁcient clinical evidence to establish a clear association
with cancer—particularly those with reduced penetrance or adult onset
(attenuated phenotypes)27. Up to date, 109 of 2,314 potential missense
variants within the gene have undergone evaluation, and still, 24 of
these remain VUS. We compared the VCEP annotated variants to our
unsupervised clustering model to examine the clinical associations of
each variant cluster (Fig. 3a). A remarkable division was observed
between pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP; p < 0.0001, chi-squared
test) and benign/likely benign (B/LB; p < 0.0001, chi-squared test),
with cluster 3 displaying a complete separation for P/LP and cluster 1
for B/LB (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Within clusters 2, 4, and 5, the
distribution of VCEP annotated variants were mixed or contained more
VUS. If TP53 variant penetrance is a gradient resulting in a spectrum of
cancer risk, then clusters 2, 4, and 5 may represent intermediate risk
between B/LB cluster 1 and P/LP cluster 3. Subsequently, we explored
germline sequencing datasets to determine the prevalence of each
variant cluster in individuals with or without a history of cancer
(Supplementary Table 4). Cancer-associated missense variants in the
NCI TP53 Database were predominantly classiﬁed in cluster 3 (875/
1260 or 69%) (Fig. 3b). Similarly, cluster 3 variants comprised nearly
60% of missense variants identiﬁed in a multi-institutional validation
dataset (n = 334) collected from cancer centers across Canada, the
United States, and Germany (Fig. 3c). Non-cancer associated germline
variants from the gnomAD database, representing the general healthy
population, were most often classiﬁed in cluster 1 (79/186 or 42.5%)
(Fig. 3d). Moreover, cluster 1 variants were highly enriched in healthy
older women >70 years (19/27 or 70%) with no history of cancer
(FLOSSIES database) (Fig. 3e). Overall, the divergence of variant clus-
ters in germline carriers affected versus unaffected by cancer and the
alignment with VCEP annotations supports the potential value of our
clustering strategy to delineate germline carriers into risk stratiﬁed
groups.

were calculated using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were
used for pairwise comparisons. Source data are provided as a Source Data ﬁle.

The age of cancer onset is signiﬁcantly stratiﬁed across TP53
variant clusters
Carriers of TP53 variants endure a lifelong high susceptibility to cancer
with wide-ranging ages at onset. After separating TP53 variant carriers
into cluster-based groups, we found signiﬁcant differences between
the ages at diagnosis of cancer (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test)
(Fig. 4a, b). Carriers of protein-truncating variants (frameshift, non-
sense, and deletions; FS/NS/DEL) were included as another variant
group. Cancer diagnoses were signiﬁcantly earlier in carriers of clus-
ters 3, 5, and FS/NS/DEL variants when compared to carriers of variants
in clusters 1 and 4, with as much as 14.5 years between the median age
at onset between clusters 3 and 1 carriers (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Table 5). Importantly, our validation cohort demonstrated the same
pattern of divergent ages at diagnosis (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test),
where cluster 1 carriers exhibited the oldest onset, while clusters 3, 5,
and FS/NS/DEL carriers consistently displayed the earliest onset
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5). These observations are con-
sistent with the structural/functional consequences identiﬁed between
variant clusters. Cluster 1 and 4 variants are found within IDRs, whereas
cluster 3 and 5 variants are located within TP53 structural elements
(Supplementary Fig. 3). FS/NS/DEL protein truncating variants are also
expected to result in severe LOF. Cluster 2 variants are primarily in the
DBD structural domain, however, unlike cluster 3, these variants tend
to occur away from DNA contact sites and are predicted to be less
deleterious (Supplementary Fig. 3). As such, carriers of cluster 2 var-
iants appear to have intermediate cancer onset relative to the other
clusters.

Upon analysis of cancer diagnoses in the NCI TP53 Database, we
noticed a drastic increase in frequency for cluster 5 carriers around age

30 due to a surge of breast tumor cases (Fig. 4a). Breast tumor onset
varied considerably between the groups (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis
test). Carriers of clusters 3, 5, and FS/NS/DEL variants each had sig-
niﬁcantly earlier onset when compared to carriers of variants in clus-
ters 1, 2, and 4 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 5). Furthermore, in
our analysis of ACC diagnosis, which is typically within the ﬁrst few
years of life, we found a signiﬁcant difference between the patient
groups (p = 0.0144; Kruskal-Wallis test). In this case, cluster 4 variant
carriers manifested ACC during young adulthood with a median age at
diagnosis of 26.5 years, whereas all other patient groups experienced
early childhood-onset ACC (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 5).

Classiﬁcation of TP53 variant carriers based on clusters reveals
unique cancer-type distributions and an osteosarcoma-prone
subgroup
Individuals carrying a pathogenic germline TP53 variant are affected by
a broad range of cancers during childhood and adulthood, and some
experience multiple cancers. We classiﬁed TP53 variant carriers in the
NCI TP53 Database based on the ﬁve clusters and investigated the
cancer-type distributions. Each group of patients exhibited a diverse
range of cancers (Fig. 5a) and our analysis revealed signiﬁcant differ-
ences (chi-squared test) between the occurrence of speciﬁc cancer
types when comparing across all groups (Supplementary Table 6).
Interestingly, cluster 1 variant carriers presented with considerably
fewer core LFS cancer types (57.1%) versus all other patient groups that
each totalled approximately 75% LFS core cancers (Fig. 5b and Sup-
plementary Data 2). The core cancers that are commonly associated
with LFS are osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas (STS), breast tumors,
brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), and leukemia.

Colorectal cancer is relatively uncommon in LFS, representing 3.4%
(136/3987) of total cancers in the NCI TP53 Database. We found a
signiﬁcant difference between the patient groups (p < 0.0001, chi-
squared test) in which colorectal cancers represented 12.4% (13/105)
of total cancers affecting cluster 1 variant carriers (Fig. 5c and Sup-
plementary Data 2). This atypical tumor pattern associated with
cluster 1 variant carriers demonstrates a less “LFS-like” phenotype.
Moreover, cluster 1 carriers, as well as clusters 2 and 4 carriers, were
less frequently diagnosed with more than one cancer during their
lifetimes (Fig. 5d), each having over two-fold reduced odds (Sup-
plementary Data 2) of developing multiple cancers compared to
cluster 3 and FS/NS/DEL carriers. Cluster 5 also had a high frequency
of carriers affected by multiple tumors. Although not statistically
signiﬁcant, this result aligns with the severity of functional impair-
ment (Fig. 2f, g) observed in cluster 5 variants located in structurally
signiﬁcant regions (Fig. 2d), as well as their association with early
cancer onset (Fig. 4).

compared to the more inclusive criteria for an LFS-like diagnosis (LFL;
Eeles and Birch criteria4,5). Signiﬁcant differences were observed
between the variant carrier groups when comparing between stricter
LFS diagnoses (classic LFS/Chompret; p < 0.0001, Chi-squared test) as
well as LFL diagnoses (p < 0.0001, Chi-squared test; Supplementary
Table 7 and Supplementary Data 2). Clusters 1, 2, and 4 each had fewer
individuals meeting the stricter LFS criteria compared to clusters 3, 5,
and FS/NS/DEL carriers (Fig. 5e), indicating attenuated LFS phenotypes
among those in clusters 1, 2, and 4. Notably, cluster 4 had no classic LFS
diagnoses but had the most LFL diagnoses (Fig. 5f), again, suggesting
attenuated phenotypes or conditional pathogenicity. Collectively, the
retention of TP53 functionality observed in cluster 1 variants (Fig. 2e, f),
their association with less “LFS-like” phenotypes (Figs. 4a, b and 5), as
well as the enrichment of these variants in cancer-free individuals
(Fig. 3d, e), suggest that they are B/LB. We propose that other genetic
or environmental cancer drivers may play a more signiﬁcant role in
tumorigenesis in carriers of these variants.

Next, we analyzed variant carriers across clusters based on their
fulﬁllment of diagnostic criteria for LFS, which incorporate factors
such as age of onset, cancer type, number of cancers, and family
history28. Classic LFS and Chompret criteria are more stringent

Strikingly, osteosarcomas occurred at more than twice the fre-
quency in patients carrying a cluster 5 variant (26%; 13/50 cancers)
compared to all other TP53 variant groups (p < 0.0001, chi-squared
test) (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 8). Pairwise comparisons

determined that the odds of developing osteosarcoma for cluster 5
variant carriers is signiﬁcantly higher than in all other variant carrier
groups, with odds ratios (OR) = 8.7 versus cluster 1 (95% conﬁdence
interval (CI) = 2.5–39.1; FDR = 0.0007, Fisher’s exact test), OR = 6.0
versus cluster 2 (95% CI = 2.3–15.7; FDR = 0.0007, Fisher’s exact test),
OR = 3.5 versus cluster 3 (95% CI = 1.6–6.9; FDR = 0.0024, Fisher’s exact
test), OR = 18.5 versus cluster 4 (95% CI = 2.6–817; FDR = 0.0013, Fish-
er’s exact test), and OR = 3.1 versus FS/NS/DEL (95% CI = 1.4–6.4;
FDR = 0.012, Fisher’s exact test) (Supplementary Table 6). All bone
tumors in cluster 5 (n = 14) were classiﬁed as osteosarcomas with the
exception of one unclassiﬁed bone sarcoma (not otherwise speciﬁed).
Notably, upon analysis of the TP53 variants in cluster 5 patients (n = 37),
we found that most were located in the OD and abolish oligomeriza-
tion, resulting in monomeric TP53 species (L344P, R337C, R337L,
R337P, and R342P; n = 31 individuals from 20 unrelated families)12,29.
Among carriers of these monomeric TP53 variants, osteosarcomas
accounted for 29.5% (13/44) of all cancers in this subgroup (Supple-
mentary Tables 8 and 9). To further investigate the signiﬁcance of TP53
variant clustering, we validated these ﬁndings using osteosarcoma
cells and carrier-derived non-cancer cells.

Functional assessments of TP53 variants in cancer cells and
patient-derived non-cancer cells validate the biological sig-
niﬁcance of the variant clusters
To test the biological signiﬁcance of the variant clusters, we performed
cellular assays using cancer cells as well as non-cancer cells from car-
riers. Since we observed that carriers of monomeric variants had sig-
niﬁcantly increased osteosarcoma development compared to non-
monomeric variant carriers, we expressed monomeric and non-
monomeric variants in TP53-null osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) and
performed clonogenic assays. Osteosarcoma cells expressing mono-
meric variants R342P and R337C resulted in the formation of sig-
niﬁcantly more colonies compared to variants representing the other
clusters, except for cluster 3 variants (Fig. 6a). Given the severe func-
tional consequences associated with cluster 3 variants that conferred
some of the earliest onset ages in carriers (Fig. 4), this result was
expected. When expressed in TP53-null lung adenocarcinoma cells
(H1299), the results were less pronounced or not statistically sig-
niﬁcant when comparing monomeric to non-monomeric variants,
suggesting that TP53 monomers have a greater tumorigenic inﬂuence
in the context of osteosarcoma (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Data 3).

Glutaraldehyde crosslinking and immunoblotting conﬁrmed TP53
variant expression and oligomeric status in cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4).

In many cases, amino acid substitutions at the same position were
classiﬁed into different clusters. For example, R175C, R175G, R175H,
R175L, R175P, and R175S, classiﬁed into clusters 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, and 2,
respectively. We generated and expressed each R175 variant in H1299
cells to determine whether their differential clustering is substantiated
by their oncogenic effects in cells. Based on the functional and clinical
associations, we would expect R175C in cluster 4 to exhibit less
pathogenicity compared to variants in clusters 2 or 3. Indeed, R175C
behaved like wild-type TP53 to signiﬁcantly repress colony formation
(Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the expression of cluster 3 variants R175G/H
both resulted in more colony formation compared to the cluster 2
variants R175L/P/S. These results are consistent with the ages at cancer
onset between cluster-stratiﬁed carriers: cluster 3 was associated with
the earliest onset and greater cancer penetrance in terms of LFS
diagnoses, cluster 2 variants led to intermediate onset ages with fewer
meeting LFS diagnosis criteria, and cluster 4 carriers experienced later
onset with LFL rather than stricter LFS diagnoses (Fig. 4, Fig. 5e, f).
Counterintuitively, substituting arginine (R) for cysteine (C) is pre-
dicted to introduce the largest difference based on the physical
properties of amino acids (Grantham distance = 180) (Supplementary
Fig. 5), however, this variant had no impact on TP53 activity based on
the results of the clonogenic assays (Fig. 6c). In addition, despite
having the most similar properties to R, the change from R to histidine
(H) (Grantham distance = 29) resulted in severely impaired tumor
suppressor activity in the clonogenic assays (Fig. 6c). Analysis of the
impact of these speciﬁc substitutions on the TP53 structure can
explain these discrepancies since R175 is involved in maintaining the
structural integrity of a zinc binding pocket. R175H is known to
destabilize the interaction with zinc, which is necessary for the
sequence-speciﬁc DNA binding of TP5330. Replacing R with H results in
considerable steric hindrance that would alter the zinc binding region,
whereas replacing R with C creates no steric overlap and may still
coordinate zinc binding through a thiol group (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Substitution with glycine (G) also creates no steric overlap (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5), however, the lack of a side chain might offer greater
ﬂexibility and result in the loss of structural stability, which can explain
the lack of tumor suppressor activity in the clonogenic assays and its
classiﬁcation in cluster 3 (Fig. 6c). These results highlight the impor-
tance of cellular functional assays for assessing TP53 variant
pathogenicity.

Finally, we investigated whether biological differences exist
between healthy non-cancerous cells obtained from variant carriers
representing different clusters. Unique biochemical and growth char-
acteristics have been detected in dermal ﬁbroblasts from individuals
predisposed to cancer31–34, however, this has not been reported for
TP53 variant carriers. Given the central importance of TP53 to control
cellular growth, we cultured dermal ﬁbroblasts from skin biopsies of
variant carriers and measured the metabolic growth rate. We found
that all variant carrier ﬁbroblasts had elevated metabolic activity
compared to ﬁbroblasts with wild-type TP53 (Fig. 6d). Moreover, the
metabolic activity of variant carrier ﬁbroblasts was distinctly stratiﬁed
according to the variant cluster classiﬁcations, reﬂecting their relative
pathogenicity based on our clinical analyses. Speciﬁcally, ﬁbroblasts
from cluster 3 variant carriers (Y163C and G245S) had the highest
metabolic activity, ﬁbroblasts from a cluster 2 carrier (S241Y) had
intermediate activity, and a cluster 1 carrier (P222L) exhibited the
lowest activity among the variants tested, which was slightly elevated
compared to ﬁbroblasts with wild-type TP53. Although the cluster 5
variant F338S is not monomeric, ﬁbroblasts from this carrier displayed
relatively high metabolic activity, supporting the pathogenic nature of
cluster 5 observed in clinical analyses. These results indicate that
quantiﬁable cellular properties could be harnessed in the development

of a diagnostic test to determine personal cancer risk for TP53 variant
carriers. Towards this goal, colleagues have previously attempted to
assess the transcriptional function of TP53 VUSs using a blood-based
assay. Raad et al. exposed fresh blood lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid
cell lines to doxorubicin in order to induce a TP53 response before
measuring mRNA levels from 10 TP53 responsive genes35. In total, this
assay was conducted on 46 blood samples from variant carriers har-
boring 31 unique missense variants representing clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, as
well as 8 truncating variants. We compiled and stratiﬁed this data
based on the TP53 variant clusters. Overall, variant carriers had lower
TP53 functionality compared to 54 individuals with wild-type TP53
(Fig. 6e). Carriers of cluster 1 variants had a modest reduction in TP53
function, while carriers of variants in clusters 2, 3, 4, and FS/NS/DEL
had considerably lower scores. Again, the results of this assay dis-
played a remarkable resemblance to the cancer onset ages observed in
our clinical analysis of cluster-stratiﬁed carriers (Fig. 4a–c), demon-
strating the biological signiﬁcance of our variant clustering strategy.

Discussion
The broad phenotypic spectrum related to TP53 variants necessitates a
risk stratiﬁcation strategy. Diagnosis of LFS and the understanding of
speciﬁc cancer risk is still a challenge because TP53 variants are often
rare with limited clinical evidence to base decisions on. The population
prevalence of pathogenic variants is also unclear for the same reasons.
Strikingly, TP53 variants leading to protein changes are estimated to
occur in 1.3% of the general population (based on gnomAD v4.0,
n = 807,162 individuals; not including WT variant P72R), however most
are likely benign. Current estimates suggest that pathogenic variants
are found in 1 in 3555–5476 individuals36. This number was suggested
to be as high as 1 in 400-865 using a less stringent deﬁnition of
pathogenicity, although it is now considered an overestimate. Clarity
around variant interpretations will help to avoid misclassiﬁcation and
improve patient management.

In this study, we integrated functional screens to investigate the
diverse effects of TP53 variants and to gain a comprehensive under-
standing of the genotype-phenotype relationship. Previous models to
predict variant pathogenicity treated it as a binary variable and limited
the focus to pathogenic versus benign37,38. These studies did not
examine the clinical effects of variants across a spectrum. In contrast,
our approach reﬁnes the categorization of pathogenicity and links
these ﬁndings to clinical
features, providing a comprehensive
exploration of the spectrum of genetic variants. Using unsupervised
clustering we identiﬁed ﬁve distinct TP53 variant clusters with unique
functional properties and clinical relevance. Table 1 summarizes the
main structural/functional features and clinical outcomes associated
with each variant cluster, and Supplementary Data 4 provides a
reference for variant cluster assignments. A limitation of this study was
the smaller sample size in the validation cohort that restricted the
cancer type-speciﬁc analyses. Within the validation dataset, patient
selection in the German cohort was more stringent for the inclusion of
P/LP variants according to the Fortuno criteria39, thus restricting the
representation of variants in clusters outside of these criteria.

Cluster 1 and 4 variants performed best overall in functional
mutagenesis screens by retaining the most TP53 activity (Fig. 2e–h).
Both of these clusters mapped to IDRs of the protein (Supplementary
Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that they are more tolerable structurally and
functionally. Indeed, patients harboring these germline variants dis-
played signiﬁcantly delayed cancer onset in comparison to carriers of
variants located in more highly structured TP53 protein regions from
clusters 2, 3, 5 or truncating variants (Fig. 4a–c). Cluster 1 variant car-
riers were affected by fewer LFS core cancer types, and conversely, a
greater proportion of colorectal cancers (Fig. 5b, c). Taken together,
the enrichment of cluster 1 variants in populations with no cancer
history (Fig. 3d, e), atypical and less “LFS-like” cancer types (Fig. 5a, b),
later onset ages (Fig. 4a–c), as well as having the fewest cases affected

by multiple cancers (Fig. 5d) and less LFS diagnoses (Fig. 5e) suggests
that cluster 1 variants might be B/LB. In agreement with this, the cluster
1 variants that have been reviewed by VCEP are all categorized as B/LB
(Fig. 3a). The relatively higher proportion of colorectal cancer
observed in this variant cluster (12.4%; 13/105 cancers) compared to
carriers of other variants (2.4%; 50/2046 cancers) reﬂects the pro-
portion of worldwide cancer diagnoses that are colorectal cancer (10%)
according to the World Health Organization. Notably, a previous study
suggested that multigene panel testing in colorectal cancer has
expanded the mutational analysis of TP53 to a wider range of patients,
including those who do not meet classic LFS criteria, which can result
in sampling bias that inﬂates cancer risk estimates40. We propose that
the presence of cluster 1 variants in the NCI TP53 germline dataset may
be a result of sampling bias and that other cancer risk factors con-
tribute to oncogenesis in these individuals. In our assessment of
cluster 4 variants, the retention of TP53 function (Fig. 2e–h, Fig. 6a–c),
a relatively later age of onset, particularly in cases like ACC (Fig. 4d),
and a greater likelihood of meeting LFL criteria rather than stricter LFS
criteria (Fig. 5e, f), suggests a distinct and attenuated LFS phenotype.
In contrast to clusters 1 and 4, variant clusters that mapped to
highly structured regions conferred the earliest onset. Cluster 3 var-
iants are centered in the DBD, primarily at DNA-contact sites, are
functionally deleterious, and have DN activity (Fig. 2d–h and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). These features each contribute to the highly patho-
genic phenotypes associated with cluster 3 variants, being the most
frequently reported germline variants (Fig. 3b, c). Cluster 2 variants are
similarly centered in the DBD, however, unlike cluster 3, they are
mostly situated distal to DNA-contact sites and are predicted to be less
structurally disruptive (Supplementary Fig. 3). As such, cluster 2 var-
iants conferred an intermediate phenotype between the highly
pathogenic early-onset cluster 3 variants and the late-onset or B/LB
cluster 1 variants (Fig. 4a–c), having signiﬁcantly fewer carriers meet-
ing strict LFS criteria versus cluster 3 (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, carriers of
cluster 3 variants, along with those harboring highly structurally dis-
ruptive variants in cluster 5 and FS/NS/DEL variants, were more fre-
quently affected by multiple cancers over their lifetimes compared to
carriers of clusters 1, 2, and 4 (Fig. 5d).

Interestingly, nearly all individuals in cluster 5 had variants located
in the OD that disrupt oligomerization and result in monomeric TP53
species. Our functional and clinical evaluations of cluster 5 variants
reveal that they are pathogenic, linked to early onset (Fig. 4), and
frequently fulﬁll the diagnostic criteria for LFS (Fig. 5e). A signiﬁcantly
higher incidence of osteosarcoma was found among this group com-
pared to all other variant carrier groups, suggesting an increased
susceptibility to develop osteosarcoma (Fig. 5g). To explore this pos-
sibility, we expressed monomeric variants in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells
and compared their ability to suppress colony formation versus non-
monomeric variants. Monomeric variants led to increased clonogenic
activity in Saos-2 cells, and this effect was dampened in H1299 lung
adenocarcinoma cells in comparison to variants representing other
clusters (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Data 3). Based on the functional
trends observed in Saos-2 and H1299 cells, and the signiﬁcantly higher
osteosarcoma incidence, these results suggest that monomeric var-
iants may have greater oncogenic potential in bone cells. Future work
should explore this mechanism to identify potential therapeutic
targets.

Our examination of codon 175 variants underscores how subtle
differences in TP53 amino acid substitutions can lead to remarkably
diverse cellular outcomes (Fig. 6c). Variants like R175H and R175G lead
to uncontrolled cell proliferation, while R175L, R175P, and R175S have
more moderate effects, and R175C retains wild-type functionality.
Alterations of amino acid residue 175 speciﬁcally impact zinc binding,
affecting TP53’s afﬁnity for DNA in a sequence-speciﬁc manner30. This
example highlights the precision of our TP53 variant clustering
method in distinguishing between nuanced structural and functional

Fig. 7 | Interpretation of TP53 variant clusters as a cancer susceptibility con-
tinuum based on cellular functional and clinical evidence. This schematic
representation illustrates TP53 variant clusters positioned along a continuum of
pathogenicity, ordered by increasing cancer risk. WT (teal) corresponds to normal
p53 function and no elevated cancer risk. Cluster 1 (red) includes benign or con-
ditionally pathogenic variants associated with lower risk. Cluster 4 (blue) comprises
variants that retain WT-like function but are linked to attenuated phenotypes and

intermediate risk. Cluster 2 (olive green) includes hypomorphic or partially func-
tional variants that confer intermediate risk. Cluster 5 (magenta) encompasses
monomeric variants with high risk as well as others with unclear mechanisms and
uncertain risk. T (grey) represents truncating variants associated with high risk due
to loss of p53 activity. Cluster 3 (green) consists of DN variants that interfere with
WT function and confer high risk.

differences. Across TP53, similar differential effects of variations at the
same positions could inﬂuence a range of TP53 features, including
molecular interactions and post-translational modiﬁcations.

Although TP53 impairment is a well-known driver of cancer,
many additional genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to an
individual’s overall cancer risk. We questioned whether differences
between TP53 variants could be observed in non-transformed cells,
or if compensatory mechanisms might offset TP53 dysfunction.
Previous research has revealed characteristic changes in skin ﬁbro-
blasts from individuals with an elevated cancer risk, but this has not
yet been established in TP53 variant carriers31–34. Using unstressed
dermal ﬁbroblasts, we discovered that TP53 variant carriers exhib-
ited an elevated metabolic rate, which aligned with the pathogenicity
associated with each variant cluster (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, a com-
parison of TP53 activity in blood lymphocytes from variant carriers
supported the ﬁndings observed in dermal ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 6e).
Collectively, these cellular assays validate the biological differences
between TP53 variant clusters and conﬁrm the accuracy of our
clustering strategy. Importantly, our ability to detect these char-
acteristics in healthy, non-cancerous skin and blood-derived cells
offers the potential for a personalized predictor of cancer risk in TP53
variant carriers. We are now pursuing this further in the development
of a cellular diagnostic assay.

In conclusion, our study reveals a continuum of cancer risk
associated with TP53 variants, ranging from classic LFS phenotypes
to more attenuated forms. This risk can be stratiﬁed through the
comprehensive integration of functional assays and clinical data,
offering a more nuanced understanding of variant pathogenicity
(Fig. 7). The identiﬁed variant clusters provide a framework for risk
stratiﬁcation, serving as a tool for VUS interpretations and informing
personalized approaches to cancer surveillance. Our ﬁndings suggest
that tailored adjustments to cancer surveillance protocols based on
variant cluster may be beneﬁcial. For example, carriers of monomeric
variants could beneﬁt from enhanced monitoring for bone lesions
during whole-body MRI, while those with cluster 3, 5, and FS/NS/DEL
variants require intensive early screening, particularly for early-onset
breast cancer. Additionally, clusters 2 and 4 variants are associated
with attenuated phenotypes, whereas our analyses suggest that
cluster 1 variants are benign. These ﬁndings highlight the need for

additional population-based studies to reﬁne their cancer risk pro-
ﬁles. While these ﬁndings offer insights into potential adjustments to
surveillance, carriers of P/LP variants should continue with estab-
lished surveillance routines, irrespective of clustering, until further
evidence enables individualized tumor surveillance plans based on
cluster afﬁliation. Looking ahead, for carriers of variants associated
with attenuated phenotypes, a personalized cellular diagnostic assay
could be a valuable tool in determining the need for surveillance.
Overall, our clustering approach offers a path toward more precise
clinical expectations and surveillance strategies, with the potential to
signiﬁcantly improve outcomes through personalized cancer risk
assessment.

Methods
Functional datasets and unsupervised cluster analysis
We selected saturation mutagenesis cellular functional screens as
features for dimensionality reduction. Giacomelli et al. measured
TP53 cellular loss-of-function (LOF; nutlin-3 treatment in TP53NULL
human A549 cells), dominant-negative activity (DN; nutlin-3 treat-
ment in isogenic TP53WT A549 cells), and DNA-damage repair (DDR;
etoposide treatment of TP53NULL A549 cells) using competitive
growth assays14. Kato et al. measured transcriptional activity (TA) in
yeast using a transcriptional reporter assay13. We used the median TA
values (eight TP53 promoter-speciﬁc elements to WAF1, MDM2, BAX,
14-3-3α, AIP1, GADD45, Noxa, and p53R2) normalized to WT TP53.
Matrix correlation plots comparing scaled data (Z-score normal-
ization) were generated using the pairplot function in Python’s Data
Visualization library Seaborn using the R package reticulate41,42.
Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA (principal com-
ponent analysis) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection). We performed unsupervised clustering using the
k-means algorithm with the clusGap() function from the R package
cluster, which applies the Gap Statistic method to determine the
optimal number of clusters43. For this, we used 50 Monte Carlo
samples and tested 1 to 10 clusters with 25 random starts for each.
The input data was scaled prior to clustering. PCA clustering results
were visualized using the fviz_cluster function from the R package
factoextra44. The UMAP results were visualized using the R package
umap45.

Structure/function analysis
Rendering of the structure of two TP53 core DNA-binding domains
bound to DNA (PDB #3EXJ) was done using PyMOL software (version
3.1.0). Structural/functional domain annotations for each variant were
obtained from the NCI TP53 Database. Prediction of intrinsically dis-
ordered regions (IDRs) was conducted using IUPred321. Post-clustering
functional analysis of variant clusters was performed using scaled data
(Z-score normalized).

Clinical data curation and selection criteria
The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) TP53 Database (version R20;
https://tp53.isb-cgc.org) is a repository for germline variant carriers
that was used as the discovery cohort (n = 1597) to evaluate clinical
associations. Carriers of multiple variants were removed from the
dataset because the relative contribution of the variants is unknown. In
addition, carriers of the R337H variant (n = 291) were removed from
the dataset due to a known sampling bias as a founder variant in Brazil.
Patients or tumors with no ID were removed to avoid inclusion of
duplicates. In addition, only conﬁrmed or obligate germline TP53
variant carriers were included in the analysis. The validation dataset
(n = 426 conﬁrmed carriers) is a multi-institutional collection of indi-
viduals and families carrying germline TP53 variants from registries at
three cancer centers: in Canada (The Hospital for Sick Children)46, the
United States (Perelman School of Medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania) (Supplementary Data 1), and Germany (Hannover Med-
ical School)47. The cohort from Germany included only carriers of
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants based on the Fortuno
classiﬁcation39. All carriers of protein-truncating variants (frameshift,
non-sense, and deletions) were included as a separate group (FS/NS/
DEL) in each analysis. The datasets include both male and female
participants. No stratiﬁed analyses by sex or gender were performed,
except for female breast cancer, due to the limited sample sizes within
this rare disease cohort, which constrained subgroup analysis. Sex of
participants was assigned in the validation cohorts, although it is not
reported in the gnomAD database, and it is unknown whether sex was
assigned or self-reported in the NCI TP53 Database. All participants
provided written informed consent for use of their clinical data and
acquisition of skin ﬁbroblasts. For pediatric participants, consent was
obtained from a parent or legal guardian. No compensation was pro-
vided for participation.

Comparisons with non-cancer associated datasets and the Var-
iant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) annotations
We used the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; https://
gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) v3.1.2 non-cancer dataset mapped
against the canonical transcript (Ensembl transcript ID ENST00000
269305.9) to investigate the prevalence of variants in the general
population with no history of cancer. Prevalence estimate of TP53
variants leading to protein changes in the general population was
based on gnomAD v4.0 (n = 807,162 individuals), after ﬁltering out
3’UTR, 5’UTR, intronic, and synonymous variants, as well as the WT
variant P72R, and accounting for homozygote counts. The allele count
was 10,522, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.3%. The Fabulous Ladies
Over Seventy (FLOSSIES) Database (https://whi.color.com/) contains
germline DNA sequencing from 27 genes (including TP53) collected
from 10,000 women over 70 years of age who have never had cancer.
We identiﬁed 27 TP53 variants in this dataset and mapped them against
the TP53 clusters. TP53 variant clusters were also compared to VCEP
annotations, which were obtained from the ClinVar database (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).

Construction of TP53 variants
TP53 variants were generated by introducing point mutations in wild-
type human TP53 cDNA (inserted in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian
expression vector) using site-directed mutagenesis. To introduce the

desired variants, PCR ampliﬁcation of the TP53 gene was conducted
using oligonucleotide primers containing the variants of interest
(Supplementary Table 1).

Cell culture and transfection
Saos-2 and H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 15% and 10% (v/v) heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum, respectively (American Type Culture
Collection #HTB-85 and #CRL-5803). No commonly misidentiﬁed cell
lines were used in this study. Transfections of pcDNA3.1 constructs
were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Skin biopsy
samples were collected from patients at The Hospital for Sick Children,
dissociated with collagenase for 1.5 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at
370 x g for 10 min. Cell pellets were homogenized with trypsin/EDTA
and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and washed
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before incubation with Alpha
Minimum Essential Medium (AMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5%
carbon dioxide atmosphere.

MTS colorimetric assay
Dermal ﬁbroblasts were seeded at a density of 2000 cells per well in
96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 48 h. The protocol was
conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ab197010;
Abcam). Brieﬂy, two hours after the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
reagent was added to each well, absorbance at 490 nm was measured
using a microplate reader (ELX800; BioTek).

(Roche). Cell

Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.0,
100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhi-
bitor cocktail
lysates were resolved by SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 4–12% acrylamide
gradient) and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) mem-
branes (Amersham). TP53 and β-actin were detected using a mouse
anti-human TP53 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 1:1000 dilution; IC12,
Cell Signalling) and rabbit anti-human β-actin (1:1000 dilution; 13E5,
Cell Signalling).

Oligomerization assay
Supernatants from lysed total cell extracts (8ug) were incubated with
0.025% glutaraldehyde prepared in PBS. Crosslinking reactions were
left to proceed for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were ended with the
addition of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Multimeric TP53 complexes were
resolved by SDS-PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and
immunoblotting.

Clonogenic assay
Saos-2 and H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 TP53 variants.
After 6 hours, the cells were dissociated with trypsin, washed with PBS,
and seeded at a density of 2000 cells in 6-well plates in DMEM
with FBS. The media was replaced after 24 h with media containing
750 ug/mL G418 antibiotic and cells were incubated for 10 days (H1299
cells) or 14 days (Saos-2 cells). Media changes were done every 5 days.
Cells were then ﬁxed and stained in 80% methanol, 3.7% formaldehyde,
and 0.025% crystal violet, and colonies were counted manually.

3D visualization of protein structures
The crystal structure of a TP53 core tetramer was downloaded from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB #3EXJ; https://www.rcsb.org/) and uploa-
ded to the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System version 3.1.0 (Schrö-
dinger, LLC) for structural assessments and renderings. The PyMOL
Mutagenesis command was used to analyze amino acid substitutions.

Statistical analysis
All
tests were performed using RStudio (version

2022.07.1 + 554; Posit, PBC) or GraphPad Prism (version 9). Linear
relationships in matrix correlation plots were assessed using Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine
differences between functional scores, Grantham’s distance, and ages
at onset across all groups. Pairwise comparisons were then performed
using Mann-Whitney U tests. Chi-squared tests were used to determine
signiﬁcance across groups for cancer type comparisons in variant
carriers and differences of proline substitutions in clusters. Subse-
quently, pairwise comparisons were done using two-tailed Fisher’s
exact test. All multiple hypothesis corrections for pairwise tests were
done using the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to obtain the false
discovery rate (FDR). Statistical analyses of dermal ﬁbroblast and
blood cell-based functional assays data was done using one-tailed
unpaired t-tests.
