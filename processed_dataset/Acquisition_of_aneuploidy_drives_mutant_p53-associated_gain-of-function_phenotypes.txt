p53 is mutated in over half of human cancers. In addition to losing wild-type (WT) tumor-
suppressive function, mutant p53 proteins are proposed to acquire gain-of-function (GOF)
activity, leading to novel oncogenic phenotypes. To study mutant p53 GOF mechanisms and
phenotypes, we genetically engineered non-transformed and tumor-derived WT p53 cell line
models to express endogenous missense mutant p53 (R175H and R273H) or to be deﬁcient
for p53 protein (null). Characterization of the models, which initially differed only by TP53
genotype, revealed that aneuploidy frequently occurred in mutant p53-expressing cells. GOF
phenotypes occurred clonally in vitro and in vivo, were independent of p53 alteration and
correlated with increased aneuploidy. Further, analysis of outcome data revealed that indi-
viduals with aneuploid-high tumors displayed unfavorable prognoses, regardless of the TP53
genotype. Our results indicate that genetic variation resulting from aneuploidy accounts for
the diversity of previously reported mutant p53 GOF phenotypes.

Mutation of TP53 is one of the most frequent genomic

alterations in human tumors. TP53 encodes p53, a
sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor that regulates
gene
cellular processes,
including maintenance of genome stability1. Mutations in p53 are
frequently single amino acid missense mutations that alter the
structure of the DNA-binding domain or affect residues that
directly contact DNA, both of which lead to a loss of function
(LOF) in p53 DNA binding and regulation of gene expression2,3.
In addition, several high-frequency “hotspot” missense mutations
have been proposed to confer oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF)
properties4,5. Many p53 GOF phenotypes have been described
using in vitro cell model systems and mouse models, including
proliferation6,

dysregulation12–14, enhanced migration15–18, and development of
distinct tumor spectra19.

Understanding mutant p53 GOF activities is complicated by
the diversity and context-speciﬁc nature of reported GOF phe-
notypes. The study of mutant p53 GOF activities is made even
more challenging because mutations in p53 are positively cor-
related with the development of aneuploidy20–22, which can
increase heterogeneity through diverse chromosomal alterations
and contribute to tumorigenesis23–26. Recent advances in gen-
ome editing enable the generation of model systems that can
circumvent confounding experimental
limitations of over-
expression models, including nonphysiological protein expres-
sion lacking regulation by the endogenous promoter. Use of the
CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for the study of mutant p53 func-
tion in a controlled context and has led to observations that
in myeloid
challenged the mutant p53 GOF hypothesis
malignancies27. Given the potential of using mutant p53 protein
as a therapeutic target in many cancer types, and the long-
standing debate of whether GOF activities exist, there is a cri-
tical need to study mutant p53 GOF activities in models of
epithelial malignancies controlled for the confounding effects of
exogenous protein expression and chromosomal alterations that
occur following p53 LOF.

In this study we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome edit-
ing and developed two isogenic epithelial cell line models (one
nontransformed and one tumor-derived). Parental cells were
modiﬁed to express either of the most frequently occurring p53
missense mutations (R175H or R273H), to be deﬁcient for p53
protein (null), or to retain the wild-type (WT) protein. Endo-
genous p53 expression is regulated by the native p53 promoter
in these engineered models, providing a biologically relevant
system for rigorous functional experimentation across different
p53 states. Additionally, the use of clonally derived cell lines
originating from the same near-diploid parental genetic back-
ground allows for assessment of the genomic alterations and
resulting molecular heterogeneity following mutation of TP53.
Through our comparative analyses of isogenic epithelial cells,
which initially differed only by TP53 genotype, we discovered
that
increased aneuploidy is consistently observed in our
mutant p53-expressing cell lines. Further, we discovered that
in vitro GOF phenotypes are only present in mutant p53-
expressing cell lines that display increased aneuploidy and that
these phenotypes are not dependent on mutant p53 protein
expression. Mutant p53-containing cell
lines did not have
increased tumorigenicity or metastasis in vivo, and analysis of
human tumors revealed that loss of p53 function and increased
aneuploidy were
associated with unfavorable prognoses.
Importantly, our results reveal aneuploidy as a mechanism
contributing to the diversity of reported mutant p53 GOF
phenotypes.

Results
Generation and characterization of genetically engineered cell
line models to study potential mutant p53 GOF activities. To
select cell lines that would provide controlled model systems for the
study of p53 mutation, we evaluated p53 status and the fraction of
the genome altered (FGA) across cancer cell lines (Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia, n = 957). We selected two TP53 WT lines derived
from breast epithelium that are near-diploid and have a low FGA
(MCF10A = 13%, CAL-51 = 3%) compared to pan- or breast cancer
cell lines (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). MCF10A is a non-
transformed cell
line derived from normal human mammary
epithelium28. CAL-51 is a metastatic breast cancer cell line derived
from a pleural effusion29. Both lines are considered “triple-negative”
since they lack estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and
HER2 ampliﬁcation30,31. To minimize genomic heterogeneity, we
performed single-cell selection and clonal expansion to generate a
parental clonal line for each model. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
gene editing32, we generated mutations in TP53 using homology-
directed repair (HDR) templates containing mutant bases corre-
sponding to hotspot TP53 mutations, R175H and R273H, along with
synonymous mutations to prevent CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage
of the HDR-recombined alleles (Fig. 1b, and Methods). As controls
for CRISPR-mediated off-target effects, we identiﬁed WT cell lines
that underwent incomplete HDR (containing engineered synon-
ymous mutations but not the missense mutation). TP53 null cell lines
were generated from frameshift insertions or deletions in both alleles,
resulting in cells deﬁcient for full-length p53 protein (Supplementary
Table 1). Through single-cell isolation, clonal expansion, and geno-
typing, we derived independent biological replicates for each model
and TP53 genotype; WT (R/R), null (−/−), and the two p53
mutants, R175H and R273H (H/−, or H/H) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1). In total, we generated 15 clonally
derived isogenic MCF10A cell lines (2 WT, 4 null, 4 R175H, and 5
R273H) and 21 clonally derived isogenic CAL-51 cell lines (4 WT, 5
null, 4 R175H, and 8 R273H) (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

To analyze p53 activity in the engineered TP53 lines, we
performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on all cell lines derived
from MCF10A and CAL-51 models. Both models displayed
decreased p53 target gene expression in the TP53 null, R175H,
and R273H mutant cell lines compared to WT cell lines33 (Fig. 1c).
Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed signiﬁcant negative
enrichment of p53 target gene expression in R175H and R273H
mutant and null cell lines (all comparisons: NES < −2.8, FDR <
0.0001) (Fig. 1d), demonstrating p53 LOF as a sequence-speciﬁc
transcription factor in the null, R175H and R273H cell lines. We
also analyzed protein expression after exposure of the MCF10A
and CAL-51 models to the anthracycline doxorubicin. Doxorubicin
treatment resulted in increased p53 protein levels and downstream
targets, MDM2 and p21, in cell lines expressing WT p53. p53
protein levels also increased after doxorubicin treatment in mutant
cell lines in the transformed CAL-51 model, similar to previous
reports27,34. However, no changes in MDM2 or p21 expression
were observed, further indicating p53 LOF in null, R175H, and
R273H p53 mutant cell lines (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). To
further analyze p53 activity, we treated all cell lines with the small
molecule Nutlin-3a, which inhibits the interaction between p53
and MDM2, the primary p53 negative regulator35. Comparison of
half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) revealed that only
WT cell lines were sensitive to Nutlin-3a, while all null, R175H,
and R273H cell lines showed a signiﬁcant increase in IC50 (null,
R175H, and R273H compared to WT: MCF10A, P < 0.0015; CAL-
51, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1f). Therefore, genome editing of WT TP53 to
null, R175H, or R273H mutations abrogated canonical p53
function and resulted in a loss of sensitivity to Nutlin-3a,
consistent with previously reported results27,36.

p53 mutant isogenic cell lines display increased frequency of
aneuploidy. Mutation of p53 is associated with development of
aneuploidy9,37. To evaluate the relationship between p53 muta-
tions and the development of aneuploidy, we assessed DNA
content in our MCF10A and CAL-51 models early (passage ﬁve)
after clonal expansion. Analysis of metaphase spreads and ﬂow
cytometry of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells revealed that
while the MCF10A derived lines maintained a near-diploid
median number of chromosomes, ﬁve of the CAL-51 lines (three
R273H, one R175H, and one null) contained a median number of
chromosomes >2 N (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Four of these ﬁve
were nearly tetraploid, suggesting that whole-genome doubling
(WGD) likely occurred in these cells. Since metaphase spreads
and PI staining detect gross chromosomal alterations, we also
examined DNA copy number by cytogenomic microarray

analysis (CMA) after 30 passages in culture. All MCF10A cell
lines showed aneuploidy, with chromosomal gains (1q, a portion
of 5q and 8q, and 20) consistent with known parental MCF10A
cell line karyotypes (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Addi-
tional whole-chromosome or arm-level alterations were identi-
ﬁed in chromosomes 4, 5, 13, 15, and 18 (Fig. 2a). Structural
alterations, including gain or loss of chromosomal regions, were
evident in all MCF10A cell lines. Chromothripsis, a chromo-
some shattering and rearrangement event that manifests as
alternating patterns of gains and losses, was also detected in
several MCF10A R273H mutant clones (M2-09, M2-03, and
M2-13, Fig. 2a; chromosomes 6, 7, and 15, Supplementary
Fig. 3). In contrast, the CAL-51 cells displayed mostly whole-
chromosome alterations, such as gains in chromosomes 6 and X
and losses in chromosomes 3, 13, and 16 in both the TP53

mutant and null genotypes (Fig. 2a), consistent with other
analyses of tetraploid cells38.

To identify chromosomal alterations common to each genotype,
we generated frequency plots to show the percentage of cell lines
with a given chromosomal alteration for each TP53 genotype
relative to the parental WT cell
line. Compared to null cells,
lines in both models appeared to have increased
mutant cell
frequency of chromosomal gains and losses (Fig. 2b). Statistical
analysis to compare differentiated chromosomal arm regions
between mutant and null cells revealed that chromosome 18q in
the R175H mutant MCF10A cells was the only region signiﬁcantly
altered (adjusted P < 0.1). To quantify the degree of copy number
alterations within each cell
line, we generated an integrative
aneuploidy score (AS) from the CMA data that reﬂects the sum of
segmented copy number alterations (Log2 ratios) in the clonal lines
relative to the respective parental WT clone. In both models,
lines showed an increased median AS
mutant and null cell
compared to WT (MCF10A R175H P = 0.011). Compared to null
lines, there was a signiﬁcant increase in AS in MCF10A R175H
lines (P = 0.046) (Fig. 2c). The median AS was higher in the
R273H mutant compared to null lines in both models, although
not reaching statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 2c). For use in subsequent
comparative analyses of the models, AS quantiles were used to
classify cell lines in each model as aneuploid-high (upper quantile
AS) or aneuploid-low (lower quantile AS) (Fig. 2c).

To examine the possibility that acquired mutations in other
genes could account for the observed increased aneuploidy in our

models, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES)
in
tandem with CMA. No gene mutations were signiﬁcantly
enriched in aneuploid-high cell lines in either model (Supple-
mentary Table 2). Further, no signiﬁcant enrichment
in
mutations was observed for a set of genes known to be associated
with hereditary cancers (Supplementary Fig. 4a)39. However, the

MCF10A cell
deletions in BRCA2 and RB1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). There
was not a signiﬁcant difference in the total number of mutations
in either model relative to TP53 genotype (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). In sum, these results show that aneuploidy occurs at
an increased frequency after TP53 mutation in both isogenic
models.

Gene expression changes are associated with aneuploidy and
not mutant p53 expression. Previously, mutant p53 GOF phe-
notypes were ascribed to the acquisition of a mutant p53-
dependent transcriptional program40–42. To investigate this pos-
sibility in our models, we performed RNA-seq in parallel with
CMA and WES experiments on MCF10A and CAL-51 cell lines
cultured under normal conditions or with doxorubicin to induce
genotoxic stress (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Principal component
analyses (PCA) of all genes revealed differences in global gene
expression patterns, with cell
lines clustering independent of
TP53 genotype or doxorubicin treatment in both models (Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Further, we found that the most
signiﬁcant degree of variance in the PCA could be attributed to

cell lines with higher levels of aneuploidy (Compare Fig. 3a to
Fig. 2c). We conducted differential gene expression analyses
comparing R175H or R273H mutants to null cells in MCF10A
and CAL-51 models. Comparison of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) revealed almost no shared genes between R175H or
R273H mutants in both MCF10A and CAL-51 models, except for
TP53 and a gene encoding for Histone H2A (Fig. 3b, Supple-
mentary Data 1). R175H mutant cells in the MCF10A cell line
had a larger number of DEGs; however, GSEA revealed that the

most signiﬁcantly altered pathway between MCF10A R175H and
null cells was the chromosome positional pathway CHR18Q21
indicating that increased DEGs are
(Supplementary Fig. 5c),
related to chromosomal changes in those cells (Fig. 2b).

To further assess the impact of aneuploidy on the number of
DEGs, we conducted differential gene expression analysis
between CAL-51 R273H mutants with varying levels of
aneuploidy (high, medium, or low AS) and two aneuploid-low
null cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Mutant clones with the

greatest aneuploidy showed the greatest number of DEGs,
whereas comparison of R273H AS-low versus null AS-low cells
revealed only 17 signiﬁcantly DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 5e). To
test if mutant p53 expression affected the number of DEGs, we
generated stable p53 knockdown cell
lines from our isogenic
models with shRNAs targeting TP53 or a nontargeting control
(NT) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). We validated knockdown of p53
by RNA-seq or western blot (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). RNA-seq
comparing aneuploid-high CAL-51 R273H cell lines (C2-22 and
C2-56) with NT control to those with p53 knockdown revealed
only six DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 6d), and there were no
differences in global gene expression patterns by PCA between
the p53 knockdown and NT control cells (Supplementary Fig. 6e).
These data suggest that DEGs in our isogenic p53 mutant cell
lines result from genetic variation and not a novel transcriptional
program induced by mutant p53.

Distinct transcriptional programs have been reported to be
transactivated by mutant p5341. However, we did not observe
genotype-speciﬁc patterns for these reported genes, with hetero-
geneous expression observed across cell
lines in both models
(Fig. 3c).
In the CAL-51 model, unsupervised hierarchical
lines with a higher AS clustered
clustering revealed that cell
together and had increased expression of most of these reported
mutant p53-upregulated genes (Fig. 3c, right). To determine if
our cell lines displayed gene expression patterns consistent with
those previously found in aneuploid cells, we analyzed expression
of the HET70 geneset, which consists of genes upregulated in cells
displaying karyotype heterogeneity43. Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering revealed that cell
lines with a higher AS clustered
together in both MCF10A and CAL-51 models and had increased
(Fig. 3d). These data suggest
expression of HET70 genes
transcriptional changes are associated with karyotype hetero-
geneity and are not driven by the p53 mutations analyzed herein.
We hypothesized that aneuploidy and the resulting stochastic
genetic variation led to the altered gene expression proﬁles in TP53-
mutated cells. To test this hypothesis, we determined if gene dosage
effects resulting from chromosomal alterations aligned with the
changes in gene expression observed in the PCA (Fig. 3a). For each
untreated cell
line, we compared the average transcriptome
expression per chromosome to the average chromosomal copy
number and observed a signiﬁcant correlation in highly altered
chromosomes across cells from both models (MCF10A, chromo-
some (chr) 5: r = 0.96, chr18: r = 0.99; CAL-51, chr10: r = 0.94,
chr6: r = 0.84; all P < 0.0001), but not in chromosomes lacking copy
number changes (Fig. 3d). These data indicate that chromosomal
signiﬁcantly
imbalances,
correlate with transcriptional changes in our isogenic models.

Clonal in vitro gain-of-function phenotypes are associated with
aneuploidy and not mutant p53 expression. Cancer cells with
mutant p53 have been reported to have neomorphic activities
leading to oncogenic phenotypes such as increased cellular pro-
liferation rates6, increased colony formation7,8, altered cellular
and mitochondrial metabolism7,13,44,45, and chemotherapeutic
resistance46–48. To determine if our mutant p53 cell lines dis-
played evidence of GOF activities in vitro, we performed a variety
of functional assays using our full panel of MCF10A and CAL-51
cell lines. Assessment of proliferation through cell growth assays
revealed no signiﬁcant differences in doubling time for MCF10A
and CAL-51 cells by TP53 genotype (Fig. 4a) or upon stable p53
knockdown (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). Decreased pro-
liferation has been associated with aneuploid states49. Similarly, in
both MCF10A and CAL-51 models, the average doubling time for
aneuploid-high cells was higher than that of aneuploid-low cells
(MCF10A P = 0.035, CAL-51 P = 0.047) (Supplementary Fig. 8a).

Colony-formation assays also revealed no signiﬁcant differences
for MCF10A and CAL-51 cells by TP53 genotype or with p53
knockdown; however, cell lines with the most colonies formed
were among those with the highest AS (M1-33, C2-56, Fig. 4c, d),
indicating that changes in cell growth in our clonal cell lines can
be attributed to genetic variation caused by aneuploidy rather
than TP53 genotype.

We evaluated our cell lines for changes in cellular metabolism
but observed no signiﬁcant differences in the level of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxides, mitochondrial
mass, or mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF10A cells by
TP53 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 8b-e). We did observe a
signiﬁcant difference in mitochondrial metabolism when measur-
ing the reduction of resazurin in MCF10A R175H clonal lines;
however, this increase was most notable in the cell line with the
highest AS (M1-33) and did not change upon p53 knockdown
(Fig. 4e, f, Supplementary Fig. 7a). In the CAL-51 lines, there was
not a signiﬁcant difference in resazurin reduction relative to TP53
genotypes or upon p53 knockdown (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary
Fig. 7b). However, similar to the MCF10A model, cell lines with
the highest metabolic activity were among those with the highest
AS (CN-81, C1-06, and C2-56, Fig. 2a), and we observed a
signiﬁcant correlation between this metabolic activity and the AS
calculated for each clone (P = 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 8f). In
CAL-51 R273H mutant cells with varying aneuploidy (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8g), we observed that mitochondrial membrane
potential was increased in three aneuploid R273H mutant lines
compared to three non-aneuploid R273H mutant lines (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8h). Previous reports have shown that mutant p53
upregulates the mevalonate pathway12; however, analysis of RNA-
seq data for mevalonate pathway gene expression revealed that
expression was clonal, and not associated with the TP53 genotype
or AS, except in the CAL-51 model in which highly aneuploid
samples

Dependent Steroid Dehydrogenase-Like (NSDHL) (Supplementary
Fig. 8i). These data indicate that altered cellular metabolism is
associated with aneuploidy and independent of TP53 genotype.

to WT cells

To determine if R175H or R273H TP53 mutations confer
resistance to commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic agents, we
treated all clonal lines in both models with increasing concentra-
tions of doxorubicin or paclitaxel for 72 h. Signiﬁcant changes in
drug sensitivity were observed when comparing cells with p53
LOF (null, R175H, or R273H)
(MCF10A,
doxorubicin [P = 0.027]; CAL-51, doxorubicin [P = 0.009], and
paclitaxel [P < 0.0001]) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). However,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in sensitivity when comparing
either R175H or R273H mutant lines to TP53 null cells in either
model or with knockdown of p53 (Supplementary Fig. 9a-d,
Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)
inhibitor 17-AAG and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
SAHA (Vorinostat) have been reported to decrease cell viability
in mutant p53-containing cancer cells50,51. However, CAL-51
cells showed no signiﬁcant differences in 17-AAG or SAHA IC50
values by TP53 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f) or after p53
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 9g, Supplementary Fig. 7b).
Compared to aneuploid-low cells, aneuploid-high cells had
signiﬁcantly increased sensitivity to SAHA (P = 0.0006) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9h). Altogether, these data indicate that in vitro
GOF phenotypes are not associated with mutant p53 expression
but can be associated with genomic alterations such as aneuploidy
that occur following the loss of p53 function.

Clonal differences
in tumorigenicity are associated with
aneuploidy and not p53 genotype. It has been reported that
tumor cells with TP53 mutations display more aggressive features

in murine models4,8. To investigate if our p53 mutant-containing
cell lines displayed gain-of-function activities that would lead to
increased tumorigenesis in vivo, we evaluated xenograft tumor
growth of our MCF10A and CAL-51 cell lines after subcutaneous
injection (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 10a). MCF10A cell lines
did not form tumors in mice, regardless of TP53 genotype or
lines
DNA content (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). CAL-51 cell
showed signiﬁcant differences in tumor growth by TP53 geno-
lines having signiﬁcantly increased
type, with TP53 null cell
tumor growth compared to TP53 WT, R175H, or R273H mutant
cells (WT vs Null, P = 0.035; R175H vs Null, P = 0.008; R273H vs
Null, P = 0.022; Fig. 5b). While tumor growth was variable across
CAL-51 cells regardless of TP53 genotype, we noticed a trend

where CAL-51 cells with a higher AS displayed increased tumor
growth (e.g., C2-56, CN-81, C2-42, Fig. 5c, Supplementary
Fig. 10d). However, not all highly aneuploid cells showed
increased growth (e.g., C1-06). Our data are consistent with
previous reports that aneuploidy can be either tumor-promoting
or tumor-suppressive52,53. Additionally, cell line CN-19 displayed
no detectable aneuploidy but was the most tumorigenic (Fig. 5c,
Supplementary Fig. 10d). To further investigate the observed
correlation between tumor growth and aneuploidy, we isolated a
diploid and tetraploid subclonal cell line from C2-09, a CAL-51
R273H mutant cell line with an intermediate growth phenotype
(Fig. 5d). The tetraploid clone 9B6 displayed signiﬁcantly
increased xenograft tumor growth (P = 0.001, Fig. 5e) and ﬁnal

tumor weight (P = 0.019, Fig. 5f) compared to the diploid clone
9B11. Analysis of tumor DNA through CMA revealed the 9B6
clone was highly aneuploid compared to clone 9B11 (Fig. 5g). In
summary, cell lines with mutant p53 did not preferentially show
increased tumorigenicity in vivo; rather, the feature of increased
aneuploidy in p53 mutant cells was associated with increased
tumorigenicity in vivo.

Metastatic phenotypes are associated with aneuploidy and not
mutant p53 expression. Mutant p53 has been associated with
cellular features leading to metastatic progression, such as
enhanced migration6,16–19,54. We performed transwell migration
assays to determine if mutant p53 alters cellular migration in our
isogenic cell line models. We did not observe a statistical differ-
ence in the average relative migration in either MCF10A or CAL-
51 clonally derived cell lines across TP53 genotypes (Fig. 6a), and
knockdown of p53 did not signiﬁcantly alter migration relative to
any genotype in MCF10A or CAL-51 cells (Fig. 6b, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7a, b). While the level of migration was variable across
each clonal cell line, the CAL-51 R273H mutant lines with the
highest overall relative migration were among those with the
most elevated AS (Fig. 6a, clones C2-60, C2-56, and C2-22). Note
that not all aneuploid cell lines showed increased migration (e.g.,
MCF10A M1-33, CAL-51 CN-81, and C1-06), suggesting speciﬁc
the degree of aneuploidy
chromosomal alterations and not
resulted in increased migration.

To determine if cells with TP53 mutations have increased
metastasis in vivo, we utilized the MetMap500, MetMap125, and
MetMap Basal-like datasets from the metastasis map (MetMap)
project, which provided the metastatic potential of barcoded and
lines following cardiac injection in mice
pooled cancer cell

(Fig. 6c)55. We compared the metastatic potential of cell lines that
were p53 WT or contained either missense or truncating
mutations in TP53. Across all
three datasets, we found no
statistical difference in the metastatic potential of cell lines based
on TP53 genotype (Fig. 6d). While there is no correlation between
in these datasets55,
total aneuploidy and metastatic potential
others have shown that chromosomal alterations are enriched
and drive metastatic tumor formation52,56. Similarly, our results
indicate that differences
such as
increased migration are not dependent on the expression of
mutant p53 or total levels of aneuploidy but are likely the result of
speciﬁc chromosomal alterations.

in metastatic phenotypes

Aneuploidy and loss of p53 function associate with unfavor-
able prognosis. TP53 mutation strongly correlates with the
development of aneuploidy20,21, and both TP53 mutation and
aneuploidy have been associated with unfavorable prognostic
features in multiple cancer types57–62. Thus, we determined the
relationship between missense TP53 mutations, aneuploidy sta-
tus, and survival across human tumor types. We ﬁrst analyzed the
fraction of the genome altered (FGA) by aneuploidy in tumors
across 19 cancer types (TCGA, n = 6682; abbreviations deﬁned in
Supplementary Table 3) that contained either missense or trun-
cating mutations in TP53. Similar to previous ﬁndings58, the FGA
was signiﬁcantly increased across a majority of tumor types with
either truncating or missense mutations in TP53 compared to
those with WT p53 (Fig. 7a). Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS),
uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), lung squamous
cell carcinoma (LUSC), ovarian (OV), and breast cancers (BRCA)
with missense TP53 mutations displayed the highest median FGA
across all cancer types (Fig. 7a). Breast and sarcomas were the

only cancer types that displayed a signiﬁcant difference between
missense and truncating TP53 mutations, with tumors containing
truncating TP53 mutations having increased FGA. Not all mis-
sense mutations in TP53 equally disrupt p53 function, so we
assessed aneuploidy in the top ﬁve most frequent missense and
truncating amino acid changes across the above tumor types with
the highest median FGA (UCS, UCEC, OV, BRCA, and LUSC).
Tumors with WT p53 had a signiﬁcantly lower FGA compared to
truncating or missense mutations (P < 0.0001); however, there
was no statistical difference between high-frequency missense and
truncating p53 alterations (Fig. 7b). This data suggest that loss of
p53 function leads to increased aneuploidy, irrespective of the
type of point mutation.

To determine if individuals with tumors containing missense
versus truncating mutations experienced differential survival, we
compared the progression-free survival in individuals with BRCA,
OV, UCEC, UCS, and LUSC. Individuals with tumors containing
either missense or truncating mutations in TP53 displayed
signiﬁcantly worse survival when compared to those with WT
p53 (P < 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in survival
between individuals with tumors containing either missense or
truncating mutations in p53 (Fig. 7c). To assess the relationship
of
from TP53
mutation, we stratiﬁed individuals with tumors containing WT,
missense, or truncating mutations in TP53 into either aneuploid-
high (upper quantile FGA) or aneuploid-low (lower quantile

tumor aneuploidy with survival,

independent

individuals with aneuploid-high tumors,
FGA) groups. All
regardless of p53 genotype, showed signiﬁcantly worse survival
outcomes compared to aneuploid-low tumors (WT P = 0.008,
truncating P = 0.004, missense P < 0.0001)
In
summary, these data indicate that progression-free survival is
not directly associated with TP53 mutation type (truncating vs.
missense). Instead, an individual’s outcome is associated with the
loss of p53 function and increased genomic alterations in their
tumor(s).

(Fig. 7d-f).

Discussion
The concept of mutant p53 GOF was introduced over 30 years
ago4,63. Since then, many publications have reported context-
speciﬁc and conﬂicting evidence for oncogenic phenotypes arising
from overexpression of the mutant protein. Evidence supporting
the mutant p53 GOF hypothesis includes the accumulation of
speciﬁc high-frequency hotspot p53 mutants, suggesting that
GOF activities confer a ﬁtness advantage. However, many hotspot
mutations, including R273 and R175, contain methylated CpG
dinucleotides, rendering them more likely to mutate by sponta-
neous deamination64. Recent ﬁndings conﬁrmed that natural
mutational processes combined with LOF and dominant-negative
activities select for the spectrum of TP53 mutations65; addition-
ally, this work found that the growth of an extensive panel of cell
lines was not dependent on mutant p53 protein expression. These
ﬁndings were corroborated by a study of mutant p53 isogenic

models of myeloid malignancies showing no evidence of GOF,
but instead LOF and dominant-negative activities over WT p53
protein27. Two concurrent studies of mouse models harboring the
knockin TP53 mutations equivalent
to R175H and R273H
showed persuasive but conﬂicting evidence for GOF in vivo, with
an increased incidence of carcinomas in R175H/−19 but not
R175H/R175H6 mice. The latter inconsistency was attributed to
differing murine genetic backgrounds. Of note, tumors from
R175H/− mice displaying altered tumor spectra also showed
enlarged nuclei and polyploid cells in hematoxylin and eosin-
stained tumor sections19, consistent with the notion that aneu-
ploidy could underlie differences in tumor development and GOF
activities reported using these models.

The increased aneuploidy observed in our mutant p53 cell lines
is consistent with previous studies37,66. There is a strong corre-
lation between TP53 mutation and aneuploidy in human
tumors20,21, and analyses of medulloblastoma tumors and acute
myeloid leukemias from Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) indivi-
duals with
increased
chromothripsis67. Fibroblasts from LFS individuals accumulate
aneuploid cells68,69, as do normal human and murine ﬁbroblasts
with exogenous expression of TP53 missense mutations9,70,71.
Further, a study of LFS individuals revealed that those who

somatic TP53 mutations

showed

developed cancer had a striking enrichment in germline copy
number variation72, suggesting that aneuploidy following p53
LOF leads to tumorigenesis. The latter is supported by the wide
range of tumorigenic phenotypes caused by aneuploidy23,25,26,
many of which have been associated with mutant p53 GOF
activities, including, but not limited to: altered proliferation49,
altered metabolism73,74, transcriptional reprogramming and drug
resistance75, immune evasion22, migration52, and invasion and
metastasis56. Given the strong propensity for cells containing
mutant p53 to become aneuploid and the overlap of tumorigenic
phenotypes related to both alterations, GOF phenotypes identi-
ﬁed in mutant p53 models must be carefully validated relative to
corresponding chromosomal changes.

The underlying mechanisms behind the increased aneuploidy
we observed in our engineered lines require further study,
although many potential mechanisms, such as loss of cell cycle
checkpoints, have been previously reported37. Our study was
limited by the number of independent cell lines assayed and the
technology available to evaluate aneuploidy. Finally, our work
only examined two speciﬁc hotspot p53 missense mutations in
two cell line models; thus, we cannot exclude the existence of
select GOF activities occurring in cells containing other p53
missense mutants or existing in different tissue-speciﬁc cellular

contexts. In addition, further studies are needed to determine the
effect of oncogenic mutations, not present in the model systems
used in the current study, on potential mutant p53 GOF activities.
In summary, our study demonstrates that the acquisition of
aneuploidy can generate a variety of the previously ascribed
mutant p53 GOF phenotypes. Further, our data showed the
heterogeneity of genomic alterations that can occur following
mutation of p53, consistent with the diverse and sometimes
conﬂicting phenotypes observed in prior reports. While we can-
not rule out the existence of p53 mutant-speciﬁc GOF effects in
other models, future studies should carefully consider how the
genomic changes that occur after the loss of WT p53 can con-
found and contribute to GOF phenotypes. Acquisition of aneu-
ploidy after the loss of WT p53 function provides a unifying
mechanism that accounts for the wide array and context-speciﬁc
nature of GOF phenotypes previously attributed to p53 mutant
proteins.

Methods
Cell culture. The CAL-51, CAL-51 isogenic clonal cell lines, and 293FT cells were
cultured in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. The MCF10A cell line and isogenic clonal
cell lines were cultured in DMEM:F12 with 5% horse serum, 100 ng/mL cholera
toxin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 20 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor, and
10 μg/mL insulin. All cell lines were maintained in the described media with 1%
penicillin and streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator at 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were
routinely tested to be negative for mycoplasma. DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis was
performed on CAL-51 and several isogenic clones in March 2016. MCF10A and
CAL-51 parental isogenic clonal cell lines were also validated against known kar-
yotypes (compare Supplementary Fig. 2a and Fig. 2a).

CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. Genome editing using the CRISPR/
Cas9 system was performed in close adherence to the Zhang lab’s protocol32. Guide
RNAs (gRNAs) were designed in the Benchling web tool (https://
www.benchling.com/); 20-nucleotide (nt) gRNAs were selected (3–5 per desired
mutation site) with the highest target speciﬁcity score that cut within at least 15nt
of the desired mutant base for screening. Complementary guide oligos were
ordered with an initial 5’ guanine (if not already present) and BbsI overhangs for
cloning into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (Addgene #48138). Guide oligos were
resuspended at 100 μM, phosphorylated, and annealed through incubation with T4
PNK and ligation buffer. Cloning into PX458 was conducted by incubating the
plasmid and diluted oligo duplexes with Tango buffer, DTT, ATP, FastDigest BbsI,
and T7 ligase. The ligation products were subsequently treated with PlasmidSafe
ATP-dependent DNase to digest residual linear DNA. Cloned plasmids were
transformed into DH5α competent cells and selected on LB agar plates containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the resulting colonies using
a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and sequence veriﬁed by Sanger
sequencing.

The following was performed to assess gRNA activity. Cloned plasmids were
transfected into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 3000; and, 72 h later, DNA was
isolated from the transfected cells using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution
(Epicentre) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Genomic DNA was ampliﬁed
with primers designed to generate an asymmetric ~500 bp PCR product around the
gRNA cut site (Supplementary Table 4) using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase
High Fidelity. PCR products were puriﬁed using a QIAQuick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit
(Qiagen) and annealed by a gradual reduction in temperature from 95 °C, followed
by SURVEYOR digestion using SURVEYOR nuclease S and enhancer S with
supplemented magnesium chloride. SURVEYOR digestion products were run on a
5% polyacrylamide TBE gel and visualized using SYBR Gold. gRNAs producing a
prominent asymmetric digestion product were selected for further use (R175H &
null (amino acid position 181): CACCGTATCTGAGCAGCGCTCATGG; null
(amino acid position 196): CACCGTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAG; R273H:
CACCGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCC). A negative control (no transfected
plasmid) was included to rule out digestion products generated by endogenous
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mismatches.

Once a gRNA was selected for a speciﬁc mutant site, homology-directed repair
(HDR) templates were designed using the Benchling web tool. HDR templates were
designed to contain mutant bases corresponding to clinically observed hotspot
mutations, along with a synonymous mutation in the protospacer adjacent motif
(PAM) to prevent CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of the HDR-recombined alleles
and ~75 bp of ﬂanking homologous sequence on each side. For the following HDR
templates, nucleotides surrounded by brackets indicate the clinically observed
missense mutation, and lower-case nucleotides depict synonymous mutations
designed to disrupt the PAM site or reduce guide RNA complementarity.

When the engineering of a synonymous PAM mutant was not possible due to

codon position, two additional synonymous mutations were engineered into the
gRNA target region to reduce complementarity. HDR templates were ordered as
Ultramer oligos (IDT).

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of cells was conducted by incubating 2.5 μg of
cloned PX458 plasmid, 5 μL of P3000 reagent, 7.5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000, and if
attempting knockin mutagenesis rather than frameshift knockout, an additional
5 μL of 10 μM single-stranded HDR template in 250 μL of Opti-MEM. The
resulting DNA-lipid complexes were added to one well of a subconﬂuent six-well
plate, with the number of wells scaled as necessary. After 48 h, transfected cells
were trypsinized, washed in PBS, resuspended in 4% (v/v) FBS in PBS, and stained
with 0.5 μg/mL propidium iodide for live/dead discrimination. GFP-positive live
cells were gated using lipofectamine-only negative control cells with and without
propidium iodide along with transfected cells lacking propidium iodide.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed by the Vanderbilt Flow
Cytometry Shared Resource. GFP+/PI− cells were sorted into 96-well plates
containing complete culture medium for isolation of single-cell clones.

Clonal populations were expanded 21–28 d after sorting, and DNA was isolated

using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre) to determine the TP53
genotype. Genomic DNA was ampliﬁed with primers designed to generate an
asymmetric 500 bp PCR product around the gRNA cut site using Platinum Taq
DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. PCR products were puriﬁed using a QIAQuick
PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) and screened using restriction enzyme cut sites
present only in HDR-recombined sequences (BtsI for R175H, NlaIII for R273H).
Cells that passed the restriction digest check were further veriﬁed by Sanger
sequencing. When mixed sequencing traces were present due to heterozygous
frameshift alleles, allele cloning was conducted by amplifying genomic DNA using
primers described above with EcoRI or BamHI restriction site overhangs, followed
by digestion and cloning into the pUC19 vector (New England BioLabs) for
transformation. Once bacterial colonies were selected and expanded, DNA
isolation was performed using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and
individual clones were Sanger sequenced to identify single trace alleles. All clonal
cell line genotypes were further validated through the analysis of variants from
whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (see details below).

Xenograft tumor studies. Mice were housed and treated in accordance with NIH
guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Mice were maintained on
a 12 h light-dark cycle at 20–26 °C and 30–70% humidity, and housed in ventilated
cages with constant access to food and water. For cell line xenograft studies, female
6-8 week-old athymic nude mice (The Jackson Laboratory, #002019) were anes-
thetized using isoﬂurane and injected subcutaneously in the left and right ﬂank
with 5 × 106 MCF10A or 2.5 × 106 CAL-51 cells suspended in 200 µL PBS. Mice
were monitored weekly and palpable tumors measured with digital calipers every
3 days until the experimental endpoint, at which time mice were euthanized by
isoﬂurane overdose and cervical dislocation. Tumor volumes were calculated as
width2 × length/2. Replicate mice injected with the same cell line were removed
from the study when a single mouse had a tumor volume exceeding 1500 mm3.
Tumors used for subsequent molecular analysis were ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80 °C. All analyses were performed blinded to TP53 genotype or
aneuploidy status.

shRNA-mediated gene knockdown. TP53 (Mission TRCN0000003753 or
TRCN0000342259) or nontargeting negative control (MISSION pLKO.1-puro
Non-Mammalian shRNA Control, SCH002; Mission pLKO.5-puro TRC2 Non-
Mammalian, SHC202) shRNAs were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Lentivirus
was produced by co-transfection of shRNA-expressing viral vectors (10 µg) with
packaging plasmids PMD2.G (2.5 µg, Addgene, 12259) and pxPAX2 (7.5 µg;
Addgene, 12260) into 293FT cells. Viral supernatant was harvested 48 h after
transfection and passed through a 0.45 µm syringe ﬁlter to clear cellular debris.
Viral aliquots were stored at −80 °C prior to infection and limited to one freeze-
thaw cycle before use. Target cells were infected with a 1:10 dilution of the virus in
the presence of 10 µg/mL polybrene for 24 h. After fresh media were added, cells
were grown for 48 h until antibiotic selection with puromycin (CAL-51, 0.625 µg/
mL; MCF10A, 1 µg/mL). Knockdown was veriﬁed through immunoblotting and
RNA sequencing.

Immunoblotting. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (pH 7.4) buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.1% SDS, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% Deoxycholic Acid,
5 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM
NaF, 0.2 mM Na3VO4), and protease inhibitors (10 mg/mL CLAP, 200 mg/mL
AEBSF). Protein concentration was determined (Modiﬁed Lowry Protein Assay
Kit, ThermoFisher), and equal amounts of protein separated on SDS

polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. Western blots were
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and
incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-Mouse or goat anti-
Rabbit, Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, 31432 and 31462) for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were again washed and developed using ECL kits and digitally imaged
(Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Western blots were quan-
tiﬁed relative to loading controls with Fiji76. Primary antibodies used include: p53
DO-1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-126), GAPDH (1:1000, Merck Millipore, MAB374),
actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-47778), vinculin (1:1000, Invitrogen, 700062), MDM2
(1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-965), and p21 (1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-6246).

RNA sequencing and geneset enrichment analysis. Cell lines were harvested by
scraping, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. RNA was extracted using ZYMO
Quick-RNA MiniPrep Kits (Zymo Research) or with Aurum Total RNA Mini kit
for p53 knockdown RNA-seq experiments according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer, and 2 μg RNA (A260/280 > 2) were sent for sequencing
(VANTAGE core at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or Novogene Co. Ltd.,
Beijing, China). Sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina TruSeq or
NEBnext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kits following the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations. Sample quality control to test for RNA integrity and contamination was
performed using Agarose Gel electrophoresis and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
System. Library preparations were sequenced by the Novaseq 6000 platform,
generating unstranded 150 bp paired-end reads, and resulting in ~19–30 million
reads per sample. Raw RNA-seq reads (FASTQ ﬁles) were trimmed to remove
adapter sequences using Flexbar v3.4.077, and quality was evaluated using FastQC
v0.11.778 and MultiQC v1.579. Reads were quantiﬁed against GENCODE v28
transcripts using Salmon v0.12.080 correcting for sequence-speciﬁc bias and
fragment-level GC bias. Transcript abundances were imported into R v3.6.1 and
summarized to the gene level using tximport 1.12.381. DESeq2 v1.24.082 was used
for differential gene expression and PCA analysis with independent hypothesis
weighting IHW_1.12.083. Shrunken log-fold changes were generated using
ashr_2.2-4784. Genes were classiﬁed as differentially expressed if they had a false
discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value less than 0.1 and a Log2-fold change of ≥1 or
≤−1. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA v4.0.3)85 was conducted with the
MSigDB 7.0 genesets using GSEA Preranked in the default parameters. Genes were
ranked according to the Wald statistic output from DESeq2.

DNA content analysis using ﬂow cytometry. One million cells were prepared for
cell cycle analysis by trypsinization and washing with PBS, followed by ﬁxation in
70% ethanol. Cells were stained in a solution consisting of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100
and 20 µg/mL propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed at the Vanderbilt Flow
Cytometry Shared Resource on a 3-laser LSRSII. Single cells were selected by pulse
processing and visualized using FlowJo (10.0.7) (Supplementary Fig. 11).

DNA content analysis using metaphase spreads. Subconﬂuent cells (~75%) in a
10 cm culture dish were treated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/mL KaryoMAX colcemid
prewarmed at 37 °C. Media were removed and reserved, and cells were trypsinized
and resuspended in the reserved media. After centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C),
cells were gently resuspended with 0.2 mL media and combined with 5 mL of
0.075 M potassium chloride dropwise while vortexing gently. Cells were incubated
at 37 °C for 25 min, with gentle inversion every 5 min to keep cells in solution. Cells
were then preﬁxed with 0.5 mL prechilled methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1) ﬁxative
solution dropwise while vortexing gently. Cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min,
4 °C) and gently resuspended with 5 mL ﬁxative solution. After storage at 4 °C, cells
were dropped onto prechilled Superfrost Plus microscope slides and air-dried at a
slant for a minimum of 1 h in the dark. Cells were then mounted with ProLong
Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI and coverslipped. Metaphase spreads were
imaged (>15 individual cells per cell line) using ﬂuorescence microscopy with an
oil-immersion ×100 objective, and individual chromosomes counted manually
using Fiji.

Cytogenomic microarray and copy number analysis. Whole-genome cytoge-
nomic microarray and copy number analysis were performed at the VUMC
Cytogenetics Laboratory using the CytoScan HD SNP microarray platform
(Thermo Fisher). Brieﬂy, 250 ng of whole genomic DNA isolated from cultured cell
lines was digested with NspI, ligated with NspI adapter primers, and ampliﬁed
using Platinum Taq with a GeneAmp PCR System 9700. PCR products were
puriﬁed, fragmented, labeled with biotin, and hybridized to the microarray chip.
Chips were washed, stained, and scanned on an Affymetrix scanner. Raw CEL ﬁles
were analyzed using the Rawcopy R package (http://rawcopy.org)86. Segmented log
ratios and frequency plots were generated using the copy number R package
(v_1.24.0)87. Differential chromosome regions were analyzed with CNApp88.
Aneuploidy scores were generated relative to the WT parental clone and calculated
as the sum of the absolute value of the segmented log ratios for each proﬁled cell
line. Cell lines were classiﬁed by AS quantile as aneuploid-high (upper quantile,
MCF10A AS > 198.5, lines M1-33, M1-19, M1-12, and M2-9; CAL-51 AS ≥ 128.3,
lines CN-81, C2-56, C2-22, C2-42, C2-09, and C1-06) or aneuploid-low (lower

quantile, MCF10A AS < 114.1, lines MW-04, MW-27, MN-37, and M2-13; CAL-51
AS ≤ 43.7, lines CW-08, CW-23, CW-64, C1-18, C1-10, and C2-38).

Whole-exome sequencing. Cell lines were harvested by scraping and pellets
frozen at −80 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and
Tissue kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and
purity were measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and 500 ng were sub-
mitted for sequencing at the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics
(VANTAGE). Library preparation and capture were performed using the Twist
Exome library prep and capture kit (Twist Bioscience). Sequencing was performed
at 150 bp Paired-end on Illumina NovaSeq 6000, targeting an average of 20 M reads
per sample for 50× coverage. Data analysis was performed using an NGSPERL
based custom pipeline89. Demultiplexed raw sequencing ﬁles were trimmed with
Cutadapt (2.10)90 and read quality was evaluated using FastQC before and after
adapter trimming. All trimmed reads were aligned using BWA (0.7.17-r1188)91 to
the human genome (v38). The mapped result was reﬁned by local realignment and
base quality recalibration using GATK3, and all reads containing soft clip were
discarded. Single-nucleotide variants were called using GATK492 with Variant
Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) mode. The SNVs with inbreeding coefﬁcient
less than −0.2, a depth less than 10 in any sample, or genotype quality less than 20
in any sample were discarded. SNVs with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.3
in more than 90% of the samples were also discarded. Valid SNVs were annotated
by ANNOVAR (20180416)93. All SNVs with minor allele frequencies larger than
0.001 in any of ExAC, 1000 G, gnoMad, or TOPMed databases were treated as
high-frequency SNVs in population and removed. Copy number variations were
also called based on GATK4 germline best practice92. Mutation analysis was
conducted using the R maftools package94.

Drug sensitivity assays. For adherent viability assays, cells were seeded at 1500
cells per well in quadruplicate in 96-well plates and treated with a six-point, three-
fold dose-escalation alongside untreated controls for 72 h. AlamarBlue (Thermo-
Fisher Scientiﬁc) was used according to manufacturer recommendations, and
ﬂuorescence measured and analyzed with microplate data collection and analysis
software Gen5 (Biotek). Viability and IC50 were analyzed in Prism (Graphpad,
8.4.3) by performing a non-linear ﬁt to log-transformed normalized ﬂuorescence
values.

Doubling time analysis. For doubling time experiments, cells were seeded at 1500
cells per well in quadruplicate into ﬁve 96-well plates. Every 24 h over 5 days, plates
were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stored in PBS at 4 °C until imaging.
Hoechst 33342 was added to cells (5 µg/µL), and nuclei were counted using the
ImageXpress instrument in the Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening core.
Nuclei were counted using MetaXpress Multi-Wavelength Cell Scoring Module
V6.6.3.733 (Molecular Devices), and doubling time was calculated using the fol-
lowing formula:

Doubling time ¼

duration * logð2Þ
logðfinal concentrationÞ (cid:2) logðintial concentrationÞ

Colony-formation assay. Cell lines were seeded onto 12-well plates (Corning)
(MCF10A, 500; CAL-51, 1,000 cells per well) and incubated for seven days.
Colonies were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stained with a 1:1 mixture
of methanol and crystal violet aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at
room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with dH2O before places
inverted to dry. Images were taken using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-
COR) and colonies counted using CellProﬁler95.

Metabolic staining. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential and mass,
cells were stained with TMRE and MitoTracker Green (each at 0.2 µM), respec-
tively. Cellular ROS was measured with DCFDA reagent (2.9 µg/mL). Mitochon-
drial ROS was measured with MitoSOX Red Reagent (3.85 µg/mL). After
incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, DCFDA and MitoTracker Green staining were
visualized by ﬂow cytometry with the MACSQuant Analyzer 10 FITC channel,
while TMRE and MitoSOX staining was visualized with the PE channel (Miltenyi
Biotec). Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.5.3. For resazurin staining,
cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well in quadruplicate in 96-well plates. After
48 h, AlamarBlue was applied at a 1× concentration, and cells were incubated for
6 h. Fluorescence was analyzed with microplate data collection and analysis soft-
ware Gen5 (Biotek). Cells were then ﬁxed and counted as described for doubling
time assay.

Transwell migration assay. MCF10A (1.5 × 105) or CAL-51 (2 × 105) cells were
plated in triplicate onto transwells with 8 µm pore polycarbonate membrane inserts
(Corning) with serum-free medium. Complete medium was used as a chemoat-
tractant in the lower chamber. After 18 h, cells were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for
10 min and stained with a 1:1 mix of crystal violet in 100% methanol. Nonmigrated
cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. In parallel,
cells were separately plated onto 24-well plates without transwell inserts to

determine the total number of attached cells by ﬁxing, imaging, and counting
Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei as described for resazurin metabolic assay. The
relative migration was calculated as the number of migrated cells normalized to the
total number of cells. For each experiment, the number of cells from each image
(CAL-51, crystal violet stained ×4 magniﬁcation; MCF10A, Hoechst stained, ×20

Cancer cell line aneuploidy analysis. Cancer cell line encyclopedia96 (CCLE) and
TP53 alteration data were acquired from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org)97,98. MCF10A SNP6 copy number data
were acquired from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2346643/wiki/6225599.
The FGA by aneuploidy was calculated as the length of Log2 ratio segments > |0.2|,
divided by the length of all segments measured. MCF10A and CAL-51 copy
number heatmaps were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV
2.3.97)100.

Analysis of cancer cell line metastasis. Metastasis map (MetMap)55 data were
acquired from https://depmap.org/metmap/data/index.html. CCLE annotation and
TP53 mutation data (21Q1) were downloaded from the depmap portal (https://
depmap.org/portal/download/). WT TP53 samples were deﬁned as cell lines that
had silent mutations or no mutation in TP53. Missense cell lines were deﬁned as
those that contained a single TP53 missense mutation. Cell lines with truncating
mutations were deﬁned as those containing nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site
mutations in TP53.

TCGA aneuploidy and clinical analysis. TCGA MC3 mutation data
(mc3.v0.2.8.CONTROLLED.maf.gz)101 were used to determine the TP53 geno-
type and was downloaded from the NCI Genomic Data Commons. WT TP53
samples were deﬁned as individuals that had DNA sequencing data but no
mutation calls, silent or noncoding mutations. Samples with multiple alterations
or in-frame mutations in TP53 were removed from the analysis. Missense tumors
were deﬁned as those that contained a single TP53 missense mutation. Tumors
with truncating mutations were deﬁned as those containing nonsense, frameshift,
stop-gain, or splice-site mutations. The FGA by aneuploidy for TCGA samples
was acquired from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org). Progression-free
survival data were obtained from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data
Resource102. TCGA cohorts with low frequency (<10%) or fewer than 20 indi-
viduals with TP53 missense mutations were excluded. Survival curves were
constructed with the R survival package103 using the Kaplan–Meier method, and
the difference between groups was assessed by the Log-rank test. Individuals with
multiple tumors were excluded from the analysis. Survival was compared by TP53
genotype or between individuals with aneuploid-low (lower quantile FGA) and
aneuploid-high (upper quantile FGA) tumors with either WT, missense, or
truncating TP53 mutations.

Statistical analysis and reproducibility. Statistical analyses and visualization were
conducted using R (version 3.6.1 or 4.0.0) or Prism (version 8.4.3). All statistical
tests were two-sided and statistical details, including measures of centrality, dis-
persion, and sample size, are indicated in the ﬁgures, ﬁgure legends and source
data. Deﬁnitions of statistical signiﬁcance are deﬁned in the ﬁgure legends and
results are shown in ﬁgures if statistical signiﬁcance was determined. Analysis
between multiple groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, or through a mixed-effects model, each with mul-
tiplicity adjusted P-values. Statistical comparison between two groups was per-
formed using Student’s t-tests or pairwise Wilcoxon test with Benjamini–Hochberg
p-value correction. Correlation was analyzed using the Pearson method and
visualized with a simple linear regression with 95% conﬁdence bands. Survival
curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the Log-rank test
assessed the difference between groups.
