In addition to losing wild-type (WT) tumorsuppressive function, mutant p53 proteins are proposed to acquire gain-of-function (GOF) activity, leading to novel oncogenic phenotypes. To study mutant p53 GOF mechanisms and phenotypes, we genetically engineered non-transformed and tumor-derived WT p53 cell line models to express endogenous missense mutant p53 (R175H and R273H) or to be deﬁcient for p53 protein (null). Characterization of the models, which initially differed only by TP53 genotype, revealed that aneuploidy frequently occurred in mutant p53-expressing cells. GOF phenotypes occurred clonally in vitro and in vivo, were independent of p53 alteration and correlated with increased aneuploidy. Further, analysis of outcome data revealed that individuals with aneuploid-high tumors displayed unfavorable prognoses, regardless of the TP53 genotype. Our results indicate that genetic variation resulting from aneuploidy accounts for the diversity of previously reported mutant p53 GOF phenotypes. 1 Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA. 2 Inscripta, Inc, Boulder, CO, USA. 3 Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. 4 Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology, The James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 5 Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. 6 Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. 7 Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. 8These authors contributed equally: Timothy M.

TP53 encodes p53, a sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor that regulates gene cellular processes, including maintenance of genome stability1. Mutations in p53 are frequently single amino acid missense mutations that alter the structure of the DNA-binding domain or affect residues that directly contact DNA, both of which lead to a loss of function (LOF) in p53 DNA binding and regulation of gene expression2,3. In addition, several high-frequency “hotspot” missense mutations have been proposed to confer oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties4,5. Many p53 GOF phenotypes have been described using in vitro cell model systems and mouse models, including proliferation6, increased colony genomic instability9–11, metastasis6, growth4,8, metabolic xenograft dysregulation12–14, enhanced migration15–18, and development of distinct tumor spectra19. formation7,8, Understanding mutant p53 GOF activities is complicated by the diversity and context-speciﬁc nature of reported GOF phenotypes. The study of mutant p53 GOF activities is made even more challenging because mutations in p53 are positively correlated with the development of aneuploidy20–22, which can increase heterogeneity through diverse chromosomal alterations and contribute to tumorigenesis23–26. Recent advances in genome editing enable the generation of model systems that can circumvent confounding experimental limitations of overexpression models, including nonphysiological protein expression lacking regulation by the endogenous promoter. Use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for the study of mutant p53 function in a controlled context and has led to observations that in myeloid challenged the mutant p53 GOF hypothesis malignancies27. Given the potential of using mutant p53 protein as a therapeutic target in many cancer types, and the longstanding debate of whether GOF activities exist, there is a critical need to study mutant p53 GOF activities in models of epithelial malignancies controlled for the confounding effects of exogenous protein expression and chromosomal alterations that occur following p53 LOF. In this study we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and developed two isogenic epithelial cell line models (one nontransformed and one tumor-derived). Parental cells were modiﬁed to express either of the most frequently occurring p53 missense mutations (R175H or R273H), to be deﬁcient for p53 protein (null), or to retain the wild-type (WT) protein. Endogenous p53 expression is regulated by the native p53 promoter in these engineered models, providing a biologically relevant system for rigorous functional experimentation across different p53 states. Additionally, the use of clonally derived cell lines originating from the same near-diploid parental genetic background allows for assessment of the genomic alterations and resulting molecular heterogeneity following mutation of TP53. Through our comparative analyses of isogenic epithelial cells, which initially differed only by TP53 genotype, we discovered that increased aneuploidy is consistently observed in our mutant p53-expressing cell lines. Further, we discovered that in vitro GOF phenotypes are only present in mutant p53expressing cell lines that display increased aneuploidy and that these phenotypes are not dependent on mutant p53 protein expression. Mutant p53-containing cell lines did not have increased tumorigenicity or metastasis in vivo, and analysis of human tumors revealed that loss of p53 function and increased aneuploidy were associated with unfavorable prognoses. Importantly, our results reveal aneuploidy as a mechanism contributing to the diversity of reported mutant p53 GOF phenotypes. Generation and characterization of genetically engineered cell line models to study potential mutant p53 GOF activities. To select cell lines that would provide controlled model systems for the study of p53 mutation, we evaluated p53 status and the fraction of the genome altered (FGA) across cancer cell lines (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, n = 957). We selected two TP53 WT lines derived from breast epithelium that are near-diploid and have a low FGA (MCF10A = 13%, CAL-51 = 3%) compared to pan- or breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). MCF10A is a nontransformed cell line derived from normal human mammary epithelium28. CAL-51 is a metastatic breast cancer cell line derived from a pleural effusion29. Both lines are considered “triple-negative” since they lack estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and HER2 ampliﬁcation30,31. To minimize genomic heterogeneity, we performed single-cell selection and clonal expansion to generate a parental clonal line for each model. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing32, we generated mutations in TP53 using homologydirected repair (HDR) templates containing mutant bases corresponding to hotspot TP53 mutations, R175H and R273H, along with synonymous mutations to prevent CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of the HDR-recombined alleles (Fig. 1b, and Methods). As controls for CRISPR-mediated off-target effects, we identiﬁed WT cell lines that underwent incomplete HDR (containing engineered synonymous mutations but not the missense mutation). TP53 null cell lines were generated from frameshift insertions or deletions in both alleles, resulting in cells deﬁcient for full-length p53 protein (Supplementary Table 1). Through single-cell isolation, clonal expansion, and genotyping, we derived independent biological replicates for each model and TP53 genotype; WT (R/R), null (−/−), and the two p53 mutants, R175H and R273H (H/−, or H/H) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1). In total, we generated 15 clonally derived isogenic MCF10A cell lines (2 WT, 4 null, 4 R175H, and 5 R273H) and 21 clonally derived isogenic CAL-51 cell lines (4 WT, 5 null, 4 R175H, and 8 R273H) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To analyze p53 activity in the engineered TP53 lines, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on all cell lines derived from MCF10A and CAL-51 models. Both models displayed decreased p53 target gene expression in the TP53 null, R175H, and R273H mutant cell lines compared to WT cell lines33 (Fig. 1c). Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed signiﬁcant negative enrichment of p53 target gene expression in R175H and R273H mutant and null cell lines (all comparisons: NES < −2.8, FDR < 0.0001) (Fig. 1d), demonstrating p53 LOF as a sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor in the null, R175H and R273H cell lines. We also analyzed protein expression after exposure of the MCF10A and CAL-51 models to the anthracycline doxorubicin. Doxorubicin treatment resulted in increased p53 protein levels and downstream targets, MDM2 and p21, in cell lines expressing WT p53. p53 protein levels also increased after doxorubicin treatment in mutant cell lines in the transformed CAL-51 model, similar to previous reports27,34. However, no changes in MDM2 or p21 expression were observed, further indicating p53 LOF in null, R175H, and R273H p53 mutant cell lines (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). To further analyze p53 activity, we treated all cell lines with the small molecule Nutlin-3a, which inhibits the interaction between p53 and MDM2, the primary p53 negative regulator35. Comparison of half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) revealed that only WT cell lines were sensitive to Nutlin-3a, while all null, R175H, and R273H cell lines showed a signiﬁcant increase in IC50 (null, R175H, and R273H compared to WT: MCF10A, P < 0.0015; CAL51, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1f). Therefore, genome editing of WT TP53 to null, R175H, or R273H mutations abrogated canonical p53 function and resulted in a loss of sensitivity to Nutlin-3a, consistent with previously reported results27,36. 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ARTICLE d e r e t l A e m o n e G n o i t c a r F 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 a c CDKN1A MDM2 TIGAR BAX POLH XPC FAS SESN1 BBC3 LIF e Pan-Cancer Cell Lines (n = 958) Breast Cancer Cell Lines (n = 53) b 1.

Mutation of p53 is associated with development of aneuploidy9,37. To evaluate the relationship between p53 mutations and the development of aneuploidy, we assessed DNA content in our MCF10A and CAL-51 models early (passage ﬁve) after clonal expansion. Analysis of metaphase spreads and ﬂow cytometry of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells revealed that while the MCF10A derived lines maintained a near-diploid median number of chromosomes, ﬁve of the CAL-51 lines (three R273H, one R175H, and one null) contained a median number of chromosomes >2 N (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Four of these ﬁve were nearly tetraploid, suggesting that whole-genome doubling (WGD) likely occurred in these cells. Since metaphase spreads and PI staining detect gross chromosomal alterations, we also examined DNA copy number by cytogenomic microarray analysis (CMA) after 30 passages in culture. All MCF10A cell lines showed aneuploidy, with chromosomal gains (1q, a portion of 5q and 8q, and 20) consistent with known parental MCF10A cell line karyotypes (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Additional whole-chromosome or arm-level alterations were identiﬁed in chromosomes 4, 5, 13, 15, and 18 (Fig. 2a). Structural alterations, including gain or loss of chromosomal regions, were evident in all MCF10A cell lines. Chromothripsis, a chromosome shattering and rearrangement event that manifests as alternating patterns of gains and losses, was also detected in several MCF10A R273H mutant clones (M2-09, M2-03, and M2-13, Fig. 2a; chromosomes 6, 7, and 15, Supplementary Fig. 3). In contrast, the CAL-51 cells displayed mostly wholechromosome alterations, such as gains in chromosomes 6 and X and losses in chromosomes 3, 13, and 16 in both the TP53 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | 3 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | MCF10A CAL-51 a T W MW-04 MW-27 MN-40 MN-39 MN-38 MN-37 M1-12 M1-23 M1-19 M1-33 M2-13 M2-03 M2-15 M2-09 l l u N H 5 7 1 R H 3 7 2 R T W l l u N H 5 7 1 R H 3 7 2 R CW-08 CW-23 CW-64 CW-67 CN-18 CN-19 CN-91 CN-92 CN-81 C1-18 C1-10 C1-09 C1-06 C2-12 C2-38 C2-31 C2-09 C2-42 C2-60 C2-22 C2-56 LogR 0.2 0.2 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 X 18 20 22 16 14 12 10 8 MCF10A * CAL51 6 * 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 X 18 20 22 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 b MCF10A CAL-51 3 5 4 1 2 c ) % . l e r ( s s o l r o n i a g h t i w s e n i l l a n o C l 100 50 0 50 100 100 50 0 50 100 100 50 0 50 100 100 50 0 50 100 50 25 0 25 50 50 30 10 10 30 50 50 25 0 25 50 50 30 10 10 30 50 (cid:129) 18q W T N u l l R 1 7 5 H R 2 7 3 H 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 X 12 14 16 18 20 22 10 8 6 4 2 1 3 5 7 9 11 12 13 15 17 19 21 X 14 16 18 20 22 10 8 6 4 2 400 300 200 M1-33 M2-09 M1-19 M1-12 100 MW-27 MN-37 M2-13 CW23 CW64 C2-56 C2-22 CN-81 C1-06 C2-42 C2-09 e r o c S y d o p u e n A l i 0 MW-04 TP53 Genotype: WT CW-08 C1−18 C1−10 C2-38 Null R175H R273H WT Null R175H R273H AS Quantile: low (Q1) high (Q4) Fig. 2 p53 mutant isogenic cell lines display increased frequency of aneuploidy. a Copy number alterations (Log2 ratios, LogR) in MCF10A (left) and CAL-51 (right) isogenic cell lines grouped by TP53 genotype.

To identify chromosomal alterations common to each genotype, we generated frequency plots to show the percentage of cell lines with a given chromosomal alteration for each TP53 genotype relative to the parental WT cell line. Compared to null cells, lines in both models appeared to have increased mutant cell frequency of chromosomal gains and losses (Fig. 2b). Statistical analysis to compare differentiated chromosomal arm regions between mutant and null cells revealed that chromosome 18q in the R175H mutant MCF10A cells was the only region signiﬁcantly altered (adjusted P < 0.1). To quantify the degree of copy number alterations within each cell line, we generated an integrative aneuploidy score (AS) from the CMA data that reﬂects the sum of segmented copy number alterations (Log2 ratios) in the clonal lines relative to the respective parental WT clone. In both models, lines showed an increased median AS mutant and null cell compared to WT (MCF10A R175H P = 0.011). Compared to null lines, there was a signiﬁcant increase in AS in MCF10A R175H lines (P = 0.046) (Fig. 2c). The median AS was higher in the R273H mutant compared to null lines in both models, although not reaching statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 2c). For use in subsequent comparative analyses of the models, AS quantiles were used to classify cell lines in each model as aneuploid-high (upper quantile AS) or aneuploid-low (lower quantile AS) (Fig. 2c). To examine the possibility that acquired mutations in other genes could account for the observed increased aneuploidy in our models, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) in tandem with CMA. No gene mutations were signiﬁcantly enriched in aneuploid-high cell lines in either model (Supplementary Table 2). Further, no signiﬁcant enrichment in mutations was observed for a set of genes known to be associated with hereditary cancers (Supplementary Fig. 4a)39. However, the line with the highest AS (M1-33) displayed MCF10A cell deletions in BRCA2 and RB1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). There was not a signiﬁcant difference in the total number of mutations in either model relative to TP53 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In sum, these results show that aneuploidy occurs at an increased frequency after TP53 mutation in both isogenic models. Gene expression changes are associated with aneuploidy and not mutant p53 expression. Previously, mutant p53 GOF phenotypes were ascribed to the acquisition of a mutant p53dependent transcriptional program40–42. To investigate this possibility in our models, we performed RNA-seq in parallel with CMA and WES experiments on MCF10A and CAL-51 cell lines cultured under normal conditions or with doxorubicin to induce genotoxic stress (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Principal component analyses (PCA) of all genes revealed differences in global gene expression patterns, with cell lines clustering independent of TP53 genotype or doxorubicin treatment in both models (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Further, we found that the most signiﬁcant degree of variance in the PCA could be attributed to 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ARTICLE cell lines with higher levels of aneuploidy (Compare Fig. 3a to Fig. 2c). We conducted differential gene expression analyses comparing R175H or R273H mutants to null cells in MCF10A and CAL-51 models. Comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed almost no shared genes between R175H or R273H mutants in both MCF10A and CAL-51 models, except for TP53 and a gene encoding for Histone H2A (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 1). R175H mutant cells in the MCF10A cell line had a larger number of DEGs; however, GSEA revealed that the most signiﬁcantly altered pathway between MCF10A R175H and null cells was the chromosome positional pathway CHR18Q21 indicating that increased DEGs are (Supplementary Fig. 5c), related to chromosomal changes in those cells (Fig. 2b). To further assess the impact of aneuploidy on the number of DEGs, we conducted differential gene expression analysis between CAL-51 R273H mutants with varying levels of aneuploidy (high, medium, or low AS) and two aneuploid-low null cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5d).

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | 5 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | greatest aneuploidy showed the greatest number of DEGs, whereas comparison of R273H AS-low versus null AS-low cells revealed only 17 signiﬁcantly DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 5e). To test if mutant p53 expression affected the number of DEGs, we generated stable p53 knockdown cell lines from our isogenic models with shRNAs targeting TP53 or a nontargeting control (NT) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). We validated knockdown of p53 by RNA-seq or western blot (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). RNA-seq comparing aneuploid-high CAL-51 R273H cell lines (C2-22 and C2-56) with NT control to those with p53 knockdown revealed only six DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 6d), and there were no differences in global gene expression patterns by PCA between the p53 knockdown and NT control cells (Supplementary Fig. 6e). These data suggest that DEGs in our isogenic p53 mutant cell lines result from genetic variation and not a novel transcriptional program induced by mutant p53. Distinct transcriptional programs have been reported to be transactivated by mutant p5341. However, we did not observe genotype-speciﬁc patterns for these reported genes, with heterogeneous expression observed across cell lines in both models (Fig. 3c). In the CAL-51 model, unsupervised hierarchical lines with a higher AS clustered clustering revealed that cell together and had increased expression of most of these reported mutant p53-upregulated genes (Fig. 3c, right). To determine if our cell lines displayed gene expression patterns consistent with those previously found in aneuploid cells, we analyzed expression of the HET70 geneset, which consists of genes upregulated in cells displaying karyotype heterogeneity43. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that cell lines with a higher AS clustered together in both MCF10A and CAL-51 models and had increased (Fig. 3d). These data suggest expression of HET70 genes transcriptional changes are associated with karyotype heterogeneity and are not driven by the p53 mutations analyzed herein. We hypothesized that aneuploidy and the resulting stochastic genetic variation led to the altered gene expression proﬁles in TP53mutated cells. To test this hypothesis, we determined if gene dosage effects resulting from chromosomal alterations aligned with the changes in gene expression observed in the PCA (Fig. 3a). For each untreated cell line, we compared the average transcriptome expression per chromosome to the average chromosomal copy number and observed a signiﬁcant correlation in highly altered chromosomes across cells from both models (MCF10A, chromosome (chr) 5: r = 0.96, chr18: r = 0.99; CAL-51, chr10: r = 0.94, chr6: r = 0.84; all P < 0.0001), but not in chromosomes lacking copy number changes (Fig. 3d). These data indicate that chromosomal signiﬁcantly imbalances, correlate with transcriptional changes in our isogenic models. than mutant p53 expression, rather Clonal in vitro gain-of-function phenotypes are associated with aneuploidy and not mutant p53 expression. Cancer cells with mutant p53 have been reported to have neomorphic activities leading to oncogenic phenotypes such as increased cellular proliferation rates6, increased colony formation7,8, altered cellular and mitochondrial metabolism7,13,44,45, and chemotherapeutic resistance46–48. To determine if our mutant p53 cell lines displayed evidence of GOF activities in vitro, we performed a variety of functional assays using our full panel of MCF10A and CAL-51 cell lines. Assessment of proliferation through cell growth assays revealed no signiﬁcant differences in doubling time for MCF10A and CAL-51 cells by TP53 genotype (Fig. 4a) or upon stable p53 knockdown (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). Decreased proliferation has been associated with aneuploid states49. Similarly, in both MCF10A and CAL-51 models, the average doubling time for aneuploid-high cells was higher than that of aneuploid-low cells (MCF10A P = 0.035, CAL-51 P = 0.047) (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Colony-formation assays also revealed no signiﬁcant differences for MCF10A and CAL-51 cells by TP53 genotype or with p53 knockdown; however, cell lines with the most colonies formed were among those with the highest AS (M1-33, C2-56, Fig. 4c, d), indicating that changes in cell growth in our clonal cell lines can be attributed to genetic variation caused by aneuploidy rather than TP53 genotype. We evaluated our cell lines for changes in cellular metabolism but observed no signiﬁcant differences in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxides, mitochondrial mass, or mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF10A cells by TP53 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 8b-e). We did observe a signiﬁcant difference in mitochondrial metabolism when measuring the reduction of resazurin in MCF10A R175H clonal lines; however, this increase was most notable in the cell line with the highest AS (M1-33) and did not change upon p53 knockdown (Fig. 4e, f, Supplementary Fig. 7a). In the CAL-51 lines, there was not a signiﬁcant difference in resazurin reduction relative to TP53 genotypes or upon p53 knockdown (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, similar to the MCF10A model, cell lines with the highest metabolic activity were among those with the highest AS (CN-81, C1-06, and C2-56, Fig. 2a), and we observed a signiﬁcant correlation between this metabolic activity and the AS calculated for each clone (P = 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 8f). In CAL-51 R273H mutant cells with varying aneuploidy (Supplementary Fig. 8g), we observed that mitochondrial membrane potential was increased in three aneuploid R273H mutant lines compared to three non-aneuploid R273H mutant lines (Supplementary Fig. 8h). Previous reports have shown that mutant p53 upregulates the mevalonate pathway12; however, analysis of RNAseq data for mevalonate pathway gene expression revealed that expression was clonal, and not associated with the TP53 genotype or AS, except in the CAL-51 model in which highly aneuploid samples the gene NAD(P) Dependent Steroid Dehydrogenase-Like (NSDHL) (Supplementary Fig. 8i). These data indicate that altered cellular metabolism is associated with aneuploidy and independent of TP53 genotype. showed increased expression of to WT cells To determine if R175H or R273H TP53 mutations confer resistance to commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic agents, we treated all clonal lines in both models with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin or paclitaxel for 72 h. Signiﬁcant changes in drug sensitivity were observed when comparing cells with p53 LOF (null, R175H, or R273H) (MCF10A, doxorubicin [P = 0.027]; CAL-51, doxorubicin [P = 0.009], and paclitaxel [P < 0.0001]) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in sensitivity when comparing either R175H or R273H mutant lines to TP53 null cells in either model or with knockdown of p53 (Supplementary Fig. 9a-d, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor 17-AAG and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) have been reported to decrease cell viability in mutant p53-containing cancer cells50,51. However, CAL-51 cells showed no signiﬁcant differences in 17-AAG or SAHA IC50 values by TP53 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f) or after p53 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 9g, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Compared to aneuploid-low cells, aneuploid-high cells had signiﬁcantly increased sensitivity to SAHA (P = 0.0006) (Supplementary Fig. 9h). Altogether, these data indicate that in vitro GOF phenotypes are not associated with mutant p53 expression but can be associated with genomic alterations such as aneuploidy that occur following the loss of p53 function. Clonal differences in tumorigenicity are associated with aneuploidy and not p53 genotype. It has been reported that tumor cells with TP53 mutations display more aggressive features 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | ARTICLE NT shRNA p53 shRNA NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | a MN-39 CW-67 M1−33 M1−19 M2−09 C2-60 AS C2-09 C2-56 400 200 0 1.5 1.2 0.9 0.6 ) d ( e m T g n i i l b u o D ) d ( e m T g n i i l b u o D 1.0 0.5 MCF10A WT Null R175H R273H CAL-51 WT Null R175H R273H 0.0 MN-38 Cell Line: TP53 Genotype: M1−33 d C2-56 AS 400 200 0 C2-60 d e m r o F s e i n o o C l 400 300 200 100 0 TP53 Genotype: c 300 200 100 d e m r o F s e i n o o C l b 1.5 MCF10A 1.5 CAL-51 1.0 0.5 0.0 MN-39 M1-19 M1-33 M2-03 M2-09 CN-81 CN-19 C1-09 C1-06 C2-09 C2-56 Null R175H R273H Null R175H R273H MCF10A 400 CAL-51 NT shRNA p53 shRNA 300 200 100 0 Cell Line: TP53 Genotype: MN-38 MN-39 M1-19 M1-33 M2-03 M2-09 CN-91 CN-81 C1-09 C1-06 C2-12 C2-56 Null R175H NT shRNA p53 shRNA R273H Null R175H R273H NT shRNA p53 shRNA 0 TP53 Genotype: MCF10A WT Null R175H R273H CAL-51 WT Null R175H R273H e ) l l e c r e p ( y t i s n e t n I n i r u s a z e R 1.25 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 TP53 Genotype: * M1−33 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 MCF10A WT Null R175H R273H C2-56 CN-81 C1−06 f AS 400 200 0 M1−33 C2−56 MCF10A 1.5 CAL-51 NT shRNA p53 shRNA 1.0 0.5 4 3 2 1 l l e c r e p y t i s n e t n I n i r u s a z e R CAL-51 WT Null R175H R273H Cell Line: TP53 Genotype: 0 MN-39 M1-19 M1-33 M2-03 M2-09 0.0 CN-19 CN-81 C1-18 C1-06 C2-09 C2-56 MN-38 Null R175H R273H Null R175H R273H Fig. 4 Differences in proliferation, colony formation, and metabolism are associated with aneuploidy and not mutant p53 expression. a Average doubling time in all MCF10A (left) and CAL-51 (right) clonal cell lines by TP53 genotype. b Doubling time in MCF10A (left) and CAL-51 (right) cell lines of the indicated TP53 genotype expressing either a nontargeting (NT, black) or p53 targeting shRNA (red).

To investigate if our p53 mutant-containing cell lines displayed gain-of-function activities that would lead to increased tumorigenesis in vivo, we evaluated xenograft tumor growth of our MCF10A and CAL-51 cell lines after subcutaneous injection (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 10a). MCF10A cell lines did not form tumors in mice, regardless of TP53 genotype or lines DNA content (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). CAL-51 cell showed signiﬁcant differences in tumor growth by TP53 genolines having signiﬁcantly increased type, with TP53 null cell tumor growth compared to TP53 WT, R175H, or R273H mutant cells (WT vs Null, P = 0.035; R175H vs Null, P = 0.008; R273H vs Null, P = 0.022; Fig. 5b). While tumor growth was variable across CAL-51 cells regardless of TP53 genotype, we noticed a trend where CAL-51 cells with a higher AS displayed increased tumor growth (e.g., C2-56, CN-81, C2-42, Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 10d). However, not all highly aneuploid cells showed increased growth (e.g., C1-06). Our data are consistent with previous reports that aneuploidy can be either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive52,53. Additionally, cell line CN-19 displayed no detectable aneuploidy but was the most tumorigenic (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 10d). To further investigate the observed correlation between tumor growth and aneuploidy, we isolated a diploid and tetraploid subclonal cell line from C2-09, a CAL-51 R273H mutant cell line with an intermediate growth phenotype (Fig. 5d).

Analysis of tumor DNA through CMA revealed the 9B6 clone was highly aneuploid compared to clone 9B11 (Fig. 5g). In summary, cell lines with mutant p53 did not preferentially show increased tumorigenicity in vivo; rather, the feature of increased aneuploidy in p53 mutant cells was associated with increased tumorigenicity in vivo. Metastatic phenotypes are associated with aneuploidy and not mutant p53 expression. Mutant p53 has been associated with cellular features leading to metastatic progression, such as enhanced migration6,16–19,54. We performed transwell migration assays to determine if mutant p53 alters cellular migration in our isogenic cell line models. We did not observe a statistical difference in the average relative migration in either MCF10A or CAL51 clonally derived cell lines across TP53 genotypes (Fig. 6a), and knockdown of p53 did not signiﬁcantly alter migration relative to any genotype in MCF10A or CAL-51 cells (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). While the level of migration was variable across each clonal cell line, the CAL-51 R273H mutant lines with the highest overall relative migration were among those with the most elevated AS (Fig. 6a, clones C2-60, C2-56, and C2-22). Note that not all aneuploid cell lines showed increased migration (e.g., MCF10A M1-33, CAL-51 CN-81, and C1-06), suggesting speciﬁc the degree of aneuploidy chromosomal alterations and not resulted in increased migration. To determine if cells with TP53 mutations have increased metastasis in vivo, we utilized the MetMap500, MetMap125, and MetMap Basal-like datasets from the metastasis map (MetMap) project, which provided the metastatic potential of barcoded and lines following cardiac injection in mice pooled cancer cell (Fig. 6c)55. We compared the metastatic potential of cell lines that were p53 WT or contained either missense or truncating mutations in TP53. Across all three datasets, we found no statistical difference in the metastatic potential of cell lines based on TP53 genotype (Fig. 6d). While there is no correlation between in these datasets55, total aneuploidy and metastatic potential others have shown that chromosomal alterations are enriched and drive metastatic tumor formation52,56. Similarly, our results indicate that differences such as increased migration are not dependent on the expression of mutant p53 or total levels of aneuploidy but are likely the result of speciﬁc chromosomal alterations. in metastatic phenotypes Aneuploidy and loss of p53 function associate with unfavorable prognosis. TP53 mutation strongly correlates with the development of aneuploidy20,21, and both TP53 mutation and aneuploidy have been associated with unfavorable prognostic features in multiple cancer types57–62. Thus, we determined the relationship between missense TP53 mutations, aneuploidy status, and survival across human tumor types. We ﬁrst analyzed the fraction of the genome altered (FGA) by aneuploidy in tumors across 19 cancer types (TCGA, n = 6682; abbreviations deﬁned in Supplementary Table 3) that contained either missense or truncating mutations in TP53. Similar to previous ﬁndings58, the FGA was signiﬁcantly increased across a majority of tumor types with either truncating or missense mutations in TP53 compared to those with WT p53 (Fig. 7a). Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), ovarian (OV), and breast cancers (BRCA) with missense TP53 mutations displayed the highest median FGA across all cancer types (Fig. 7a).

Source data are provided in the Source Data File. only cancer types that displayed a signiﬁcant difference between missense and truncating TP53 mutations, with tumors containing truncating TP53 mutations having increased FGA. Not all missense mutations in TP53 equally disrupt p53 function, so we assessed aneuploidy in the top ﬁve most frequent missense and truncating amino acid changes across the above tumor types with the highest median FGA (UCS, UCEC, OV, BRCA, and LUSC). Tumors with WT p53 had a signiﬁcantly lower FGA compared to truncating or missense mutations (P < 0.0001); however, there was no statistical difference between high-frequency missense and truncating p53 alterations (Fig. 7b). This data suggest that loss of p53 function leads to increased aneuploidy, irrespective of the type of point mutation. To determine if individuals with tumors containing missense versus truncating mutations experienced differential survival, we compared the progression-free survival in individuals with BRCA, OV, UCEC, UCS, and LUSC. Individuals with tumors containing either missense or truncating mutations in TP53 displayed signiﬁcantly worse survival when compared to those with WT p53 (P < 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in survival between individuals with tumors containing either missense or truncating mutations in p53 (Fig. 7c). To assess the relationship of from TP53 mutation, we stratiﬁed individuals with tumors containing WT, missense, or truncating mutations in TP53 into either aneuploidhigh (upper quantile FGA) or aneuploid-low (lower quantile tumor aneuploidy with survival, independent individuals with aneuploid-high tumors, FGA) groups. All regardless of p53 genotype, showed signiﬁcantly worse survival outcomes compared to aneuploid-low tumors (WT P = 0.008, truncating P = 0.004, missense P < 0.0001) In summary, these data indicate that progression-free survival is not directly associated with TP53 mutation type (truncating vs. missense). Instead, an individual’s outcome is associated with the loss of p53 function and increased genomic alterations in their tumor(s). (Fig. 7d-f). The concept of mutant p53 GOF was introduced over 30 years ago4,63. Since then, many publications have reported contextspeciﬁc and conﬂicting evidence for oncogenic phenotypes arising from overexpression of the mutant protein. Evidence supporting the mutant p53 GOF hypothesis includes the accumulation of speciﬁc high-frequency hotspot p53 mutants, suggesting that GOF activities confer a ﬁtness advantage. However, many hotspot mutations, including R273 and R175, contain methylated CpG dinucleotides, rendering them more likely to mutate by spontaneous deamination64. Recent ﬁndings conﬁrmed that natural mutational processes combined with LOF and dominant-negative activities select for the spectrum of TP53 mutations65; additionally, this work found that the growth of an extensive panel of cell lines was not dependent on mutant p53 protein expression. These ﬁndings were corroborated by a study of mutant p53 isogenic NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | 9 e 1.00 l a v i v r u S t n e c r e P 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 f l a v i v r u S t n e c r e P 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | **** **** **** ** **** *** * *** ** ** ** *** *** **** *** **** **** **** **** TP53 Genotype WT Truncating Missense *** *** **** **** **** **** * ** *** *** a d e r e t l A e m o n e G n o i t c a r F 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 TCGA Cohort: S C U V O C S U L C E C U A C R B A C S E M C K S A C L B C H L I D A U L D A T S D A E R D A O C C S N H M B G D A R P D A A P G G L TP53 Genotype WT Truncating **** Missense **** c l a v i v r u S t n e c r e P d b d e r e t l A e m o n e G n o i t c a r F 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 C R A S 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0 WT ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + ++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + + + +++ + + TP53 Genotype WT Truncating Missense + + + + Truncating vs Missense: p = ns Truncating/Missense vs WT: p < 0.0001 + Truncating ++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ +++ p = 0.0041 FGA Quartile Low (Q1) + High (Q4) + + ++ ++++++++++++++++ +++ + + ++ +++++++++ +++++ +++ ++ ++ + + + + 2000 4000 Progression-free Survival (days) 6000 8000 0 1000 4000 Progression-free Survival (days) 2000 3000 5000 T W * 3 1 2 R * 6 9 1 R e c i l p s _ 5 2 2 X e c i l p s _ 7 8 1 X e c i l p s _ 1 3 3 X H 3 7 2 R H 5 7 1 R Q 8 4 2 R W 8 4 2 R C 0 2 2 Y p53 Protein Change 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 l a v i v r u S t n e c r e P ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++ ++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + ++++ ++ + FGA Quartile Low (Q1) + High (Q4) + +++ p = 0.0084 Missense ++++++++++++++++++++ + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++ +++++++++ ++ ++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++ p < 0.0001 FGA Quartile Low (Q1) + High (Q4) + +++ ++++ + + + ++++++++++ ++++++ + + 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 0 Progression-free Survival (days) 1000 Progression-free Survival (days) 4000 3000 2000 5000 Fig. 7 Aneuploidy and loss of p53 function associate with unfavorable prognosis. a, b Box and whisker plots of the fraction of the genome altered (FGA) in tumors with wild-type (WT), missense or truncating mutations in TP53 compared a across cancer types (source: The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]), or b in BRCA, OV, UCEC, UCS, and LUSC cancer types across the ﬁve most frequent truncating or missense mutations.

Log-rank tests. Source data are provided in the Source Data File. models of myeloid malignancies showing no evidence of GOF, but instead LOF and dominant-negative activities over WT p53 protein27. Two concurrent studies of mouse models harboring the knockin TP53 mutations equivalent to R175H and R273H showed persuasive but conﬂicting evidence for GOF in vivo, with an increased incidence of carcinomas in R175H/−19 but not R175H/R175H6 mice. The latter inconsistency was attributed to differing murine genetic backgrounds. Of note, tumors from R175H/− mice displaying altered tumor spectra also showed enlarged nuclei and polyploid cells in hematoxylin and eosinstained tumor sections19, consistent with the notion that aneuploidy could underlie differences in tumor development and GOF activities reported using these models. The increased aneuploidy observed in our mutant p53 cell lines is consistent with previous studies37,66. There is a strong correlation between TP53 mutation and aneuploidy in human tumors20,21, and analyses of medulloblastoma tumors and acute myeloid leukemias from Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) individuals with increased chromothripsis67. Fibroblasts from LFS individuals accumulate aneuploid cells68,69, as do normal human and murine ﬁbroblasts with exogenous expression of TP53 missense mutations9,70,71. Further, a study of LFS individuals revealed that those who somatic TP53 mutations showed developed cancer had a striking enrichment in germline copy number variation72, suggesting that aneuploidy following p53 LOF leads to tumorigenesis. The latter is supported by the wide range of tumorigenic phenotypes caused by aneuploidy23,25,26, many of which have been associated with mutant p53 GOF activities, including, but not limited to: altered proliferation49, altered metabolism73,74, transcriptional reprogramming and drug resistance75, immune evasion22, migration52, and invasion and metastasis56. Given the strong propensity for cells containing mutant p53 to become aneuploid and the overlap of tumorigenic phenotypes related to both alterations, GOF phenotypes identiﬁed in mutant p53 models must be carefully validated relative to corresponding chromosomal changes. The underlying mechanisms behind the increased aneuploidy we observed in our engineered lines require further study, although many potential mechanisms, such as loss of cell cycle checkpoints, have been previously reported37. Our study was limited by the number of independent cell lines assayed and the technology available to evaluate aneuploidy. Finally, our work only examined two speciﬁc hotspot p53 missense mutations in two cell line models; thus, we cannot exclude the existence of select GOF activities occurring in cells containing other p53 missense mutants or existing in different tissue-speciﬁc cellular 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ARTICLE contexts. In addition, further studies are needed to determine the effect of oncogenic mutations, not present in the model systems used in the current study, on potential mutant p53 GOF activities. In summary, our study demonstrates that the acquisition of aneuploidy can generate a variety of the previously ascribed mutant p53 GOF phenotypes. Further, our data showed the heterogeneity of genomic alterations that can occur following mutation of p53, consistent with the diverse and sometimes conﬂicting phenotypes observed in prior reports. While we cannot rule out the existence of p53 mutant-speciﬁc GOF effects in other models, future studies should carefully consider how the genomic changes that occur after the loss of WT p53 can confound and contribute to GOF phenotypes. Acquisition of aneuploidy after the loss of WT p53 function provides a unifying mechanism that accounts for the wide array and context-speciﬁc nature of GOF phenotypes previously attributed to p53 mutant proteins. Methods Cell culture. The CAL-51, CAL-51 isogenic clonal cell lines, and 293FT cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. The MCF10A cell line and isogenic clonal cell lines were cultured in DMEM:F12 with 5% horse serum, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 20 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor, and 10 μg/mL insulin. All cell lines were maintained in the described media with 1% penicillin and streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator at 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were routinely tested to be negative for mycoplasma. DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis was performed on CAL-51 and several isogenic clones in March 2016. MCF10A and CAL-51 parental isogenic clonal cell lines were also validated against known karyotypes (compare Supplementary Fig. 2a and Fig. 2a). CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. Genome editing using the CRISPR/ Cas9 system was performed in close adherence to the Zhang lab’s protocol32. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed in the Benchling web tool (https:// 20-nucleotide (nt) gRNAs were selected (3–5 per desired mutation site) with the highest target speciﬁcity score that cut within at least 15nt of the desired mutant base for screening. Complementary guide oligos were ordered with an initial 5’ guanine (if not already present) and BbsI overhangs for cloning into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (Addgene #48138). Guide oligos were resuspended at 100 μM, phosphorylated, and annealed through incubation with T4 PNK and ligation buffer. Cloning into PX458 was conducted by incubating the plasmid and diluted oligo duplexes with Tango buffer, DTT, ATP, FastDigest BbsI, and T7 ligase. The ligation products were subsequently treated with PlasmidSafe ATP-dependent DNase to digest residual linear DNA. Cloned plasmids were transformed into DH5α competent cells and selected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the resulting colonies using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and sequence veriﬁed by Sanger sequencing. The following was performed to assess gRNA activity. Cloned plasmids were transfected into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 3000; and, 72 h later, DNA was isolated from the transfected cells using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Genomic DNA was ampliﬁed with primers designed to generate an asymmetric ~500 bp PCR product around the gRNA cut site (Supplementary Table 4) using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. PCR products were puriﬁed using a QIAQuick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) and annealed by a gradual reduction in temperature from 95 °C, followed by SURVEYOR digestion using SURVEYOR nuclease S and enhancer S with supplemented magnesium chloride. SURVEYOR digestion products were run on a 5% polyacrylamide TBE gel and visualized using SYBR Gold. gRNAs producing a prominent asymmetric digestion product were selected for further use (R175H & null (amino acid position 181): CACCGTATCTGAGCAGCGCTCATGG; null (amino acid position 196): CACCGTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAG; R273H: CACCGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCC). A negative control (no transfected plasmid) was included to rule out digestion products generated by endogenous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mismatches. Once a gRNA was selected for a speciﬁc mutant site, homology-directed repair (HDR) templates were designed using the Benchling web tool. HDR templates were designed to contain mutant bases corresponding to clinically observed hotspot mutations, along with a synonymous mutation in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to prevent CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of the HDR-recombined alleles and ~75 bp of ﬂanking homologous sequence on each side. For the following HDR templates, nucleotides surrounded by brackets indicate the clinically observed missense mutation, and lower-case nucleotides depict synonymous mutations designed to disrupt the PAM site or reduce guide RNA complementarity.

When the engineering of a synonymous PAM mutant was not possible due to codon position, two additional synonymous mutations were engineered into the gRNA target region to reduce complementarity. HDR templates were ordered as Ultramer oligos (IDT). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of cells was conducted by incubating 2.5 μg of cloned PX458 plasmid, 5 μL of P3000 reagent, 7.5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000, and if attempting knockin mutagenesis rather than frameshift knockout, an additional 5 μL of 10 μM single-stranded HDR template in 250 μL of Opti-MEM. The resulting DNA-lipid complexes were added to one well of a subconﬂuent six-well plate, with the number of wells scaled as necessary. After 48 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, resuspended in 4% (v/v) FBS in PBS, and stained with 0.5 μg/mL propidium iodide for live/dead discrimination. GFP-positive live cells were gated using lipofectamine-only negative control cells with and without propidium iodide along with transfected cells lacking propidium iodide. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed by the Vanderbilt Flow Cytometry Shared Resource. GFP+/PI− cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing complete culture medium for isolation of single-cell clones. Clonal populations were expanded 21–28 d after sorting, and DNA was isolated using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre) to determine the TP53 genotype. Genomic DNA was ampliﬁed with primers designed to generate an asymmetric 500 bp PCR product around the gRNA cut site using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. PCR products were puriﬁed using a QIAQuick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) and screened using restriction enzyme cut sites present only in HDR-recombined sequences (BtsI for R175H, NlaIII for R273H). Cells that passed the restriction digest check were further veriﬁed by Sanger sequencing. When mixed sequencing traces were present due to heterozygous frameshift alleles, allele cloning was conducted by amplifying genomic DNA using primers described above with EcoRI or BamHI restriction site overhangs, followed by digestion and cloning into the pUC19 vector (New England BioLabs) for transformation. Once bacterial colonies were selected and expanded, DNA isolation was performed using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and individual clones were Sanger sequenced to identify single trace alleles. All clonal cell line genotypes were further validated through the analysis of variants from whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (see details below). Xenograft tumor studies. Mice were housed and treated in accordance with NIH guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Mice were maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle at 20–26 °C and 30–70% humidity, and housed in ventilated cages with constant access to food and water. For cell line xenograft studies, female 6-8 week-old athymic nude mice (The Jackson Laboratory, #002019) were anesthetized using isoﬂurane and injected subcutaneously in the left and right ﬂank with 5 × 106 MCF10A or 2.5 × 106 CAL-51 cells suspended in 200 µL PBS. Mice were monitored weekly and palpable tumors measured with digital calipers every 3 days until the experimental endpoint, at which time mice were euthanized by isoﬂurane overdose and cervical dislocation. Tumor volumes were calculated as width2 × length/2. Replicate mice injected with the same cell line were removed from the study when a single mouse had a tumor volume exceeding 1500 mm3. Tumors used for subsequent molecular analysis were ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All analyses were performed blinded to TP53 genotype or aneuploidy status. shRNA-mediated gene knockdown. TP53 (Mission TRCN0000003753 or TRCN0000342259) or nontargeting negative control (MISSION pLKO.1-puro Non-Mammalian shRNA Control, SCH002; Mission pLKO.5-puro TRC2 NonMammalian, SHC202) shRNAs were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Lentivirus was produced by co-transfection of shRNA-expressing viral vectors (10 µg) with packaging plasmids PMD2.G (2.5 µg, Addgene, 12259) and pxPAX2 (7.5 µg; Addgene, 12260) into 293FT cells. Viral supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection and passed through a 0.45 µm syringe ﬁlter to clear cellular debris. Viral aliquots were stored at −80 °C prior to infection and limited to one freezethaw cycle before use. Target cells were infected with a 1:10 dilution of the virus in the presence of 10 µg/mL polybrene for 24 h. After fresh media were added, cells were grown for 48 h until antibiotic selection with puromycin (CAL-51, 0.625 µg/ mL; MCF10A, 1 µg/mL). Knockdown was veriﬁed through immunoblotting and RNA sequencing. Immunoblotting. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (pH 7.4) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.1% SDS, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% Deoxycholic Acid, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 0.2 mM Na3VO4), and protease inhibitors (10 mg/mL CLAP, 200 mg/mL AEBSF). Protein concentration was determined (Modiﬁed Lowry Protein Assay Kit, ThermoFisher), and equal amounts of protein separated on SDS NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | 11 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. Western blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-Mouse or goat antiRabbit, Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, 31432 and 31462) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed and developed using ECL kits and digitally imaged (Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Western blots were quantiﬁed relative to loading controls with Fiji76. Primary antibodies used include: p53 DO-1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-126), GAPDH (1:1000, Merck Millipore, MAB374), actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-47778), vinculin (1:1000, Invitrogen, 700062), MDM2 (1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-965), and p21 (1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-6246). RNA sequencing and geneset enrichment analysis. Cell lines were harvested by scraping, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. RNA was extracted using ZYMO Quick-RNA MiniPrep Kits (Zymo Research) or with Aurum Total RNA Mini kit for p53 knockdown RNA-seq experiments according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and 2 μg RNA (A260/280 > 2) were sent for sequencing (VANTAGE core at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or Novogene Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). Sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina TruSeq or NEBnext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kits following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Sample quality control to test for RNA integrity and contamination was performed using Agarose Gel electrophoresis and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System. Library preparations were sequenced by the Novaseq 6000 platform, generating unstranded 150 bp paired-end reads, and resulting in ~19–30 million reads per sample. Raw RNA-seq reads (FASTQ ﬁles) were trimmed to remove adapter sequences using Flexbar v3.4.077, and quality was evaluated using FastQC v0.11.778 and MultiQC v1.579. Reads were quantiﬁed against GENCODE v28 transcripts using Salmon v0.12.080 correcting for sequence-speciﬁc bias and fragment-level GC bias. Transcript abundances were imported into R v3.6.1 and summarized to the gene level using tximport 1.12.381. DESeq2 v1.24.082 was used for differential gene expression and PCA analysis with independent hypothesis weighting IHW_1.12.083. Shrunken log-fold changes were generated using ashr_2.2-4784. Genes were classiﬁed as differentially expressed if they had a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value less than 0.1 and a Log2-fold change of ≥1 or ≤−1. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA v4.0.3)85 was conducted with the MSigDB 7.0 genesets using GSEA Preranked in the default parameters. Genes were ranked according to the Wald statistic output from DESeq2. DNA content analysis using ﬂow cytometry. One million cells were prepared for cell cycle analysis by trypsinization and washing with PBS, followed by ﬁxation in 70% ethanol. Cells were stained in a solution consisting of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 µg/mL propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed at the Vanderbilt Flow Cytometry Shared Resource on a 3-laser LSRSII. Single cells were selected by pulse processing and visualized using FlowJo (10.0.7) (Supplementary Fig. 11). DNA content analysis using metaphase spreads. Subconﬂuent cells (~75%) in a 10 cm culture dish were treated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/mL KaryoMAX colcemid prewarmed at 37 °C. Media were removed and reserved, and cells were trypsinized and resuspended in the reserved media. After centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), cells were gently resuspended with 0.2 mL media and combined with 5 mL of 0.075 M potassium chloride dropwise while vortexing gently. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min, with gentle inversion every 5 min to keep cells in solution. Cells were then preﬁxed with 0.5 mL prechilled methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1) ﬁxative solution dropwise while vortexing gently. Cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and gently resuspended with 5 mL ﬁxative solution. After storage at 4 °C, cells were dropped onto prechilled Superfrost Plus microscope slides and air-dried at a slant for a minimum of 1 h in the dark. Cells were then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI and coverslipped. Metaphase spreads were imaged (>15 individual cells per cell line) using ﬂuorescence microscopy with an oil-immersion ×100 objective, and individual chromosomes counted manually using Fiji. Cytogenomic microarray and copy number analysis. Whole-genome cytogenomic microarray and copy number analysis were performed at the VUMC Cytogenetics Laboratory using the CytoScan HD SNP microarray platform (Thermo Fisher). Brieﬂy, 250 ng of whole genomic DNA isolated from cultured cell lines was digested with NspI, ligated with NspI adapter primers, and ampliﬁed using Platinum Taq with a GeneAmp PCR System 9700. PCR products were puriﬁed, fragmented, labeled with biotin, and hybridized to the microarray chip. Chips were washed, stained, and scanned on an Affymetrix scanner. Raw CEL ﬁles were analyzed using the Rawcopy R package (http://rawcopy.org)86. Segmented log ratios and frequency plots were generated using the copy number R package (v_1.24.0)87. Differential chromosome regions were analyzed with CNApp88. Aneuploidy scores were generated relative to the WT parental clone and calculated as the sum of the absolute value of the segmented log ratios for each proﬁled cell line. Cell lines were classiﬁed by AS quantile as aneuploid-high (upper quantile, MCF10A AS > 198.5, lines M1-33, M1-19, M1-12, and M2-9; CAL-51 AS ≥ 128.3, lines CN-81, C2-56, C2-22, C2-42, C2-09, and C1-06) or aneuploid-low (lower quantile, MCF10A AS < 114.1, lines MW-04, MW-27, MN-37, and M2-13; CAL-51 AS ≤ 43.7, lines CW-08, CW-23, CW-64, C1-18, C1-10, and C2-38). Whole-exome sequencing. Cell lines were harvested by scraping and pellets frozen at −80 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and 500 ng were submitted for sequencing at the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE). Library preparation and capture were performed using the Twist Exome library prep and capture kit (Twist Bioscience). Sequencing was performed at 150 bp Paired-end on Illumina NovaSeq 6000, targeting an average of 20 M reads per sample for 50× coverage. Data analysis was performed using an NGSPERL based custom pipeline89. Demultiplexed raw sequencing ﬁles were trimmed with Cutadapt (2.10)90 and read quality was evaluated using FastQC before and after adapter trimming. All trimmed reads were aligned using BWA (0.7.17-r1188)91 to the human genome (v38). The mapped result was reﬁned by local realignment and base quality recalibration using GATK3, and all reads containing soft clip were discarded. Single-nucleotide variants were called using GATK492 with Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) mode. The SNVs with inbreeding coefﬁcient less than −0.2, a depth less than 10 in any sample, or genotype quality less than 20 in any sample were discarded. SNVs with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.3 in more than 90% of the samples were also discarded. Valid SNVs were annotated by ANNOVAR (20180416)93. All SNVs with minor allele frequencies larger than 0.001 in any of ExAC, 1000 G, gnoMad, or TOPMed databases were treated as high-frequency SNVs in population and removed. Copy number variations were also called based on GATK4 germline best practice92. Mutation analysis was conducted using the R maftools package94. Drug sensitivity assays. For adherent viability assays, cells were seeded at 1500 cells per well in quadruplicate in 96-well plates and treated with a six-point, threefold dose-escalation alongside untreated controls for 72 h. AlamarBlue (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) was used according to manufacturer recommendations, and ﬂuorescence measured and analyzed with microplate data collection and analysis software Gen5 (Biotek). Viability and IC50 were analyzed in Prism (Graphpad, 8.4.3) by performing a non-linear ﬁt to log-transformed normalized ﬂuorescence values. Doubling time analysis. For doubling time experiments, cells were seeded at 1500 cells per well in quadruplicate into ﬁve 96-well plates. Every 24 h over 5 days, plates were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stored in PBS at 4 °C until imaging. Hoechst 33342 was added to cells (5 µg/µL), and nuclei were counted using the ImageXpress instrument in the Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening core. Nuclei were counted using MetaXpress Multi-Wavelength Cell Scoring Module V6.6.3.733 (Molecular Devices), and doubling time was calculated using the following formula: Doubling time ¼ duration * logð2Þ logðfinal concentrationÞ (cid:2) logðintial concentrationÞ Colony-formation assay. Cell lines were seeded onto 12-well plates (Corning) (MCF10A, 500; CAL-51, 1,000 cells per well) and incubated for seven days. Colonies were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stained with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and crystal violet aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with dH2O before places inverted to dry. Images were taken using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LiCOR) and colonies counted using CellProﬁler95. Metabolic staining. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential and mass, cells were stained with TMRE and MitoTracker Green (each at 0.2 µM), respectively. Cellular ROS was measured with DCFDA reagent (2.9 µg/mL). Mitochondrial ROS was measured with MitoSOX Red Reagent (3.85 µg/mL). After incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, DCFDA and MitoTracker Green staining were visualized by ﬂow cytometry with the MACSQuant Analyzer 10 FITC channel, while TMRE and MitoSOX staining was visualized with the PE channel (Miltenyi Biotec). Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.5.3. For resazurin staining, cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well in quadruplicate in 96-well plates. After 48 h, AlamarBlue was applied at a 1× concentration, and cells were incubated for 6 h. Fluorescence was analyzed with microplate data collection and analysis software Gen5 (Biotek). Cells were then ﬁxed and counted as described for doubling time assay. Transwell migration assay. MCF10A (1.5 × 105) or CAL-51 (2 × 105) cells were plated in triplicate onto transwells with 8 µm pore polycarbonate membrane inserts (Corning) with serum-free medium. Complete medium was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 18 h, cells were ﬁxed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stained with a 1:1 mix of crystal violet in 100% methanol. Nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. In parallel, cells were separately plated onto 24-well plates without transwell inserts to 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2021) 12:5184 | | NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ARTICLE determine the total number of attached cells by ﬁxing, imaging, and counting Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei as described for resazurin metabolic assay. The relative migration was calculated as the number of migrated cells normalized to the total number of cells. For each experiment, the number of cells from each image (CAL-51, crystal violet stained ×4 magniﬁcation; MCF10A, Hoechst stained, ×20 magniﬁcation) was counted using CellProﬁler95. Cancer cell line aneuploidy analysis. Cancer cell line encyclopedia96 (CCLE) and TP53 alteration data were acquired from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center cBioPortal (http://MCF10A SNP6 copy number data were acquired from The FGA by aneuploidy was calculated as the length of Log2 ratio segments > |0.2|, divided by the length of all segments measured. MCF10A and CAL-51 copy number heatmaps were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV 2.3.97)100. Analysis of cancer cell line metastasis. Metastasis map (MetMap)55 data were acquired from CCLE annotation and TP53 mutation data (21Q1) were downloaded from the depmap portal (https:// depmap.org/portal/download/). WT TP53 samples were deﬁned as cell lines that had silent mutations or no mutation in TP53. Missense cell lines were deﬁned as those that contained a single TP53 missense mutation. Cell lines with truncating mutations were deﬁned as those containing nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations in TP53. TCGA aneuploidy and clinical analysis. TCGA MC3 mutation data (mc3.v0.2.8.CONTROLLED.maf.gz)101 were used to determine the TP53 genotype and was downloaded from the NCI Genomic Data Commons. WT TP53 samples were deﬁned as individuals that had DNA sequencing data but no mutation calls, silent or noncoding mutations. Samples with multiple alterations or in-frame mutations in TP53 were removed from the analysis. Missense tumors were deﬁned as those that contained a single TP53 missense mutation. Tumors with truncating mutations were deﬁned as those containing nonsense, frameshift, stop-gain, or splice-site mutations. The FGA by aneuploidy for TCGA samples was acquired from cBioPortal (http://Progression-free survival data were obtained from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource102. TCGA cohorts with low frequency (<10%) or fewer than 20 individuals with TP53 missense mutations were excluded. Survival curves were constructed with the R survival package103 using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the difference between groups was assessed by the Log-rank test. Individuals with multiple tumors were excluded from the analysis. Survival was compared by TP53 genotype or between individuals with aneuploid-low (lower quantile FGA) and aneuploid-high (upper quantile FGA) tumors with either WT, missense, or truncating TP53 mutations. Statistical analysis and reproducibility. Statistical analyses and visualization were conducted using R (version 3.6.1 or 4.0.0) or Prism (version 8.4.3). All statistical tests were two-sided and statistical details, including measures of centrality, dispersion, and sample size, are indicated in the ﬁgures, ﬁgure legends and source data. Deﬁnitions of statistical signiﬁcance are deﬁned in the ﬁgure legends and results are shown in ﬁgures if statistical signiﬁcance was determined. Analysis between multiple groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, or through a mixed-effects model, each with multiplicity adjusted P-values. Statistical comparison between two groups was performed using Student’s t-tests or pairwise Wilcoxon test with Benjamini–Hochberg p-value correction. Correlation was analyzed using the Pearson method and visualized with a simple linear regression with 95% conﬁdence bands. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the Log-rank test assessed the difference between groups. Reporting summary.
