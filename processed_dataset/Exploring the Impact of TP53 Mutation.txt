Abstract

TP (tumor protein) 53 mutation status plays a critical role in cancer progression and may
influence survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving
immunotherapy. This study investigates the impact of TP53 mutation status and im-
munotherapy treatment on survival in NSCLC patients. This retrospective study analyzed
NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab or ipilimumab plus nivolumab, stratified by
TP53 mutation status and PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) expression (<1%, 1–49%,
>50%). Survival outcomes (overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were
assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank tests, with subgroup analysis by his-
tological subtype. In squamous cell cancer (SCC) patients, no significant differences in
OS or PFS were found based on TP53 mutation status or treatment type. A trend toward
improved survival was observed with pembrolizumab (p = 0.088). In adenocarcinoma
patients, significant differences in OS and PFS were observed based on TP53 mutation
status. Pembrolizumab showed superior survival outcomes compared to ipilimumab plus
nivolumab in TP53 wild-type patients (p < 0.001). PD-L1 ≥ 1% also predicted better out-
comes, especially in adenocarcinoma patients. TP53 mutation status and immunotherapy
type significantly influence survival outcomes in NSCLC, particularly in adenocarcinoma
patients. Pembrolizumab demonstrated superior efficacy in TP53 wild-type patients, with
PD-L1 expression further refining survival predictions. These findings underscore the
importance of personalized treatment strategies based on TP53 status and PD-L1 ex-
pression in NSCLC. Further studies are needed to validate these results and optimize
treatment approaches.

1. Introduction

Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, posing
a significant public health challenge. It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with an
estimated 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths annually. The majority of lung cancer
patients, over two-thirds, are diagnosed at age 65 or older, with only a small minority (3%)
being under 40. This age demographic, coupled with the fact that most cases are diagnosed
when the cancer has already metastasized beyond the lungs, significantly contributes to
the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with the illness [1–5].

Histologically, lung cancer is broadly categorized into small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
accounting for 15–20% of cases, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which represents
the vast majority at 80–85%. NSCLC itself is further subtyped, with adenocarcinoma being
the most common (45–50% of cases), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (30–35%), large-
cell carcinoma (10–15%), and other less frequent types (around 5%). The poor prognosis of
NSCLC, in particular, stems from the alarming statistic that approximately 70% of patients
are diagnosed at advanced stages (III–IV), leading to a median survival period of only
about one year [2–7].

The incidence of lung cancer varies globally, with higher rates in countries with higher
smoking prevalence, although the disease is increasingly diagnosed in non-smokers as
well. Risk factors such as tobacco use, occupational exposures, and genetic predisposition
contribute to the development of lung cancer, but environmental factors and air pollution
are also gaining attention as emerging causes. The geographical variations in lung cancer
incidence and mortality highlight the global burden of the disease. China, the United
States, and Japan report the highest numbers of new cases and deaths. When considering
age-standardized rates, Hungary, New Caledonia, China, Serbia, and French Polynesia
show the highest incidence per 100,000 people [5–8].

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used as first-line treatment for non-
oncogene-addicted NSCLC. Recent trials have demonstrated that the value of programmed
death ligand-1 (PD-L1) serves as a predictive factor for survival when ICIs are used
whether as monotherapy or in combination therapy of chemo-immunotherapy compared
to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced NSCLC [8–12].

Many genes are implicated in the onset and progression of NSCLC, with tumor protein
P53 (TP53) being one of the most well-known and widely studied. Reports have shown that
the occurrence of TP53 mutations in primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in NSCLC was
23.2% and 21.4%, respectively, with reported frequencies varying by geographical region [12–16].
One study reported an overall prevalence of 45.2% in NSCLC, with 25.0% in adeno-
carcinomas and 63.6% in squamous cell carcinomas. Another study documented TP53
mutation rates ranging from 40% to 46% specifically in adenocarcinomas [17–19].

TP53 is located on chromosome 17p and encodes the p53 protein. When TP53 is
mutated, p53 loses its ability to regulate cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair processes,
contributing to the initiation and progression of tumors. Approximately 80% of TP53
mutations are missense mutations, while the remaining mutations include frameshifts,
truncations, and deletions [13–18].

TP53, a gene frequently mutated in NSCLC, contains 11 exons, with exons 2 to
11 encoding a 393-amino acid protein known as p53. Under normal conditions, various
stress signals can activate the p53 signaling pathway, triggering multiple transcriptional
programs. Cell cycle arrest is primarily mediated by p21, a checkpoint protein that inhibits
cyclin-dependent kinases. DNA repair is facilitated by genes such as POLH, RRM2B, and
PCNA, while apoptosis is triggered through both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways.
Additionally, p53 regulates numerous other cellular processes. Inactivation of TP53 leads to
increased cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and contributes to cancer progression [19–22].

The prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in patients treated with ICIs is not well under-
stood, and no studies have assessed the outcomes of TP53 mutations in patients receiving
a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and an ICI (such as pembrolizumab, or
ipilimumab plus nivolumab). With the recent approval of these combinations, there is
significant variability in first-line treatment approaches. Therefore, our study aims to inves-
tigate the prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in patients undergoing standard first-line
treatment for advanced metastatic NSCLC.

2. Results

A total of 346 patients participated in this study (Table 1). Patients had a median
age of 67 years, with a range from 37 to 87 years. The majority of the patients were male
(68.5%), and most had adenocarcinoma (67.3%) as the histology. Smoking history showed
that 50.4% were current smokers, 35.9% were past smokers, and 13% were never smokers.
The ECOG performance status distribution was 20.9% in ECOG 0, 58% in ECOG 1, and
21.2% in ECOG 2+. Regarding immunotherapy, 59.2% received pembrolizumab, and 40.8%
received ipilimumab plus nivolumab. PD-L1 expression in the overall population was
distributed as 36.7% with <1%, 26.0% with 1–49%, and 37.3% with >50%.

41 to 86 years. In terms of gender, 27.8% are female and 72.2% are male. Histologically,
65.8% of participants have adenocarcinoma, 31.6% have squamous cell carcinoma, and
2.6% have other types. No participants in this group have adenosquamous carcinoma.
Regarding smoking status, 6.3% of participants are never smokers, A total of 49.3% are
current smokers, 43.0% are past smokers, and 1.4% have unknown smoking status. In
terms of ECOG performance status, 24% have an ECOG score of 0, 52% have a score
of 1, and 24% have a score of 2 or higher. For immunotherapy, 65.8% of participants
received pembrolizumab, while 7.8% received ipilimumab plus nivolumab. Regarding
PD-L1 expression, 34.1% have PD-L1 expression of less than 1%, 19% have expression
between 1% and 49%, and 46.9% have expression greater than 50%.

In contrast, the 267 patients with TP53 wild-type (77.17%) had a median age of
66.9 years, with a range from 37 to 87 years. Among this group, 32.7% were female,
and 67.3% were male. Histologically, most patients had adenocarcinoma (68.3%), followed
by squamous cell carcinoma (26.4%). The smoking status showed that 39.04% were current
smokers and 26.01% were past smokers. For ECOG, 59.6% were in ECOG 1, 19.8% in ECOG
0, and 20.6% in ECOG 2+. Immunotherapy was administered to 57.4% of patients with
pembrolizumab and 42.6% with ipilimumab plus nivolumab. Regarding PD-L1 expression,
37.5% had <1%, 34.5% had 1–49%, and 28% had ≥50%.

The median OS in our cohort was 30.0 months for patients without the TP53 mutation
and 32.0 months for those with the TP53 mutation, (p = 0.930), (Figure 1A). The median
PFS was 20.0 months for patients without the TP53 mutation, compared to 16.0 months for
patients with the mutation, (p = 0.950), (Figure 1B).

(A) The median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI: 23.73 to 36.27) for patients without the TP53 mutation and
32.0 months (95% CI: 17.86 to 46.15) for patients with the TP53 mutation. The log-rank test indicated no
significant survival difference between the groups (p = 0.930). (B) The median progression-free survival

 A B Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6939

was 20.0 months (95% CI: 15.40 to 24.60) for patients without the TP53 mutation and 16.0 months
(95% CI: 2.73 to 29.27) for patients with the TP53 mutation. The log-rank test showed no significant
difference between the two groups (p = 0.950).

When comparing all groups based on PD-L1 expression (<1% or ≥1%) and TP53
mutation status (mutation or wild type), we observed a significant difference in both
median OS and median PFS. The median OS was 24.0 months for patients with PD-
L1 < 1% without the TP53 mutation, 37.0 months for those with PD-L1 ≥ 1% without the
TP53 mutation, 35.0 months for patients with PD-L1 < 1% with the TP53 mutation, and
32.0 months for patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% with the TP53 mutation, (p = 0.027), (Figure 2A).
Regarding PFS, the median was 14.0 months for patients with PD-L1 < 1% without the TP53
mutation, 26.0 months for those with PD-L1 ≥ 1% without the TP53 mutation, 13.0 months
for patients with PD-L1 < 1% with the TP53 mutation, and 26.0 months for those with
PD-L1 ≥ 1% with the TP53 mutation, (p = 0.042), (Figure 2B).

Figure 2. Comparison of median OS and PFS based on PD-L1 expression and TP53 mutation status.
(A) The median OS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 18.08 to 29.92) for patients with PD-L1 < 1% without
TP53 mutation, 37.0 months (95% CI: 27.06 to 46.95) for patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% without TP53
mutation, 35.0 months (95% CI: 12.56 to 57.44) for patients with PD-L1 < 1% with TP53 mutation,
and 32.0 months (95% CI: 15.11 to 48.89) for patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% with TP53 mutation. The
log-rank test indicated a statistically significant survival difference between the groups (p = 0.027).
(B) Progression-Free Survival: The median progression-free survival was 14.0 months (95% CI: 10.71 to
17.29) for patients with PD-L1 < 1% without TP53 mutation, 26.0 months (95% CI: 19.03 to 32.97) for
patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% without TP53 mutation, 13.0 months (95% CI: 6.66 to 19.34) for patients with
PD-L1 < 1% with TP53 mutation, and 26.0 months (95% CI: 10.56 to 41.44) for patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1%
with TP53 mutation. The log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups
(p = 0.042).

In subgroups’ analysis regarding to PDL-1 expressions (<1%, 1–49%, and >50%), in
PDL-1 negative patients, no significant differences in median OS or median PFS were ob-
served between those with and without the TP53 mutation. The median OS was 24.0 months
(95% CI: 18.08 to 29.92) for patients without the TP53 mutation and 35.0 months (95% CI:
12.56 to 57.44) for those with the mutation (p-value 0.629), (Figure 3A). Similarly, the median
PFS was 14.0 months for patients without the TP53 mutation and 13.0 months for those
with the mutation (p-value 0.705), (Figure 3B).

Figure 3. Subgroup analysis of median OS and PFS in PD-L1 negative (>1%) patients based on TP53
mutation status. (A) The median OS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 18.08 to 29.92) for patients without the
TP53 mutation and 35.0 months (95% CI: 12.56 to 57.44) for patients with the TP53 mutation. The
log-rank test indicated no significant survival difference between the groups (p = 0.629). (B) The
median PFS was 14.0 months (95% CI: 10.71 to 17.29) for patients without the TP53 mutation and
13.0 months (95% CI: 6.66 to 19.34) for patients with the TP53 mutation. The log-rank test showed no
significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.705).

In patients with PDL-1 expression between 1–49%, there was no significant difference
in median OS or median PFS between those with and without the TP53 mutation. The
median OS was 24.0 months for patients without the TP53 mutation and 36.0 months
for those with the mutation (p-value 0.342), (Figure 4A). Similarly, the median PFS was
14.0 months (95% CI: 8.24 to 19.76) for patients without the TP53 mutation and 32.0 months
for those with the mutation (p-value 0.255), (Figure 4B).

In patients with PDL-1 expression > 50%, TP53 mutation status was associated with
a significant difference in median OS, with those without the mutation having a longer
median OS (49.0 months) compared to those with the mutation (31.0 months, p = 0.044),
(Figure 5A). However, no significant difference was observed in median PFS, with a median
of 40.0 months for patients without the TP53 mutation and 16.0 months for those with the
mutation (p = 0.111), (Figure 5B).

based on TP53 mutation status. (A) The median OS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 16.22 to 31.78) for
patients without the TP53 mutation and 36.0 months (95% CI: 0.00 to 75.90) for patients with the
TP53 mutation. The log-rank test indicated no significant survival difference between the groups
(p = 0.342). (B) The median PFS was 14.0 months (95% CI: 8.24 to 19.76) for patients without the TP53
mutation and 32.0 months (95% CI: 0.00 to 72.87) for patients with the TP53 mutation. The log-rank
test showed no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.255).

without TP53 mutation and 31.0 months (95% CI 21.803 to 40.197) for those with TP53 mutation.
The log-rank test showed a significant difference in survival between the two groups (p = 0.044).
(B) The median PFS was 40.0 months (95% CI 31.967 to 48.033) for patients without TP53 mutation
and 16.0 months (95% CI 0.570 to 31.430) for those with TP53 mutation. The log-rank test showed no
statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.111).

When comparing survival outcomes based on gender, we found no significant dif-
ference in either median OS or median PFS between individuals with and without the
TP53 mutation. Specifically, the median OS was 38.0 months for females without TP53,
28.0 months for males without TP53, 62.0 months for females with TP53, and 31.0 months
for males with TP53 (p = 0.369), (Figure 6A). Regarding median PFS, it was 27.0 months for
females without TP53 and 18.0 months for males without TP53. For females with TP53, the
median PFS was not estimable, while for males with TP53, the median PFS was 13.0 months
(p = 0.637), (Figure 6B).

Figure 6. Comparison of median OS and PFS based on gender and TP53 mutation status. (A) The
median OS was 38.0 months (95% CI: 26.69 to 49.31) for females without TP53, 28.0 months (95%
CI: 22.53 to 33.47) for males without TP53, 62.0 months (95% CI: 22.40 to 101.60) for females with
TP53, and 31.0 months (95% CI: 22.15 to 39.85) for males with TP53. The log-rank test indicated no
statistically significant difference in survival distributions between the groups (p = 0.369). (B) The
median PFS was 27.0 months (95% CI: 16.78 to 37.22) for females without TP53, 18.0 months (95% CI:
12.99 to 23.01) for males without TP53, while median survival was not estimable for females with
TP53. For males with TP53, the median progression-free survival was 13.0 months (95% CI: 10.16 to
15.84). The log-rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.637).

When comparing survival outcomes based on subtype of histology, among adeno-
carcinoma patients, we observed significant differences in both median PFS and median
OS depending on both PDL-1 expression and TP53 mutation status. The median OS was
22.0 months for patients with PDL-1 < 1% without TP53, 36.0 months for those with PDL-
1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 39.0 months for those with PDL-1 < 1% with TP53, and 31.0 months
for those with PDL-1 ≥ 1% with TP53 (p = 0.006), (Figure 7A). Regarding median PFS, it

was 12.0 months for those with PDL-1 < 1% without TP53, 23.0 months for those with PDL-
1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 12.0 months for those with PDL-1 < 1% with TP53, and 16.0 months
for those with PDL-1 ≥ 1% with TP53 (p = 0.017), (Figure 7B).

Figure 7. Comparison of median OS and PFS based on histological subtype, PDL-1 expression
levels, and TP53 mutation status in adenocarcinoma patients. (A) Among adenocarcinoma patients,
the median OS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 15.49 to 28.52) for those with PDL-1 < 1% without TP53,
36.0 months (95% CI: 28.90 to 43.10) for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 39.0 months (95%
CI: 11.21 to 66.79) for those with PDL1 < 1% with TP53, and 31.0 months (95% CI: 19.81 to 42.19)
for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% with TP53. The log-rank test indicated a statistically significant survival
difference between the groups (p = 0.006). (B) Among adenocarcinoma patients, the median PFS was
12.0 months (95% CI: 9.98 to 14.02) for those with PDL1 < 1% without TP53, 23.0 months (95% CI:
17.15 to 28.85) for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 12.0 months (95% CI: 5.89 to 18.11) for those
with PDL1 < 1% with TP53, and 16.0 months (95% CI: 2.02 to 29.98) for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% with
TP53. The log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.017).

On the other hand, among SCC patients, we observed no significant differences in
both median PFS and median OS. Specifically, the median OS was 36.0 months for patients

PDL-1 ≥ 1% with TP53 (p = 0.385), (Figure 8A). Regarding median PFS, it was 22.0 months
for those with PDL-1 < 1% without TP53, 39.0 months for those with PDL-1 ≥ 1% without
TP53, 15.0 months for those with PDL-1 < 1% with TP53, and was not estimable for those
with PDL-1 ≥ 1% with TP53 (p = 0.455), (Figure 8B).

Figure 8. Comparison of median OS and PFS based on PDL-1 expression levels and TP53 mutation
status in SCC patients. (A) Among SCC patients, the median overall survival was 36.0 months (95%
CI: 21.59 to 50.42) for those with PDL1 < 1% without TP53, 28.0 months (95% CI: 3.45 to 52.55) for
those with PDL1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 35.0 months (95% CI: not estimable) for those with PDL1 < 1%
with TP53, and not estimable for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% with TP53. The log-rank test indicated no
statistically significant survival difference between the groups (p = 0.385). (B) Among SCC patients,
the median PFS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 9.58 to 34.42) for those with PDL1 < 1% without TP53,
39.0 months (95% CI: 19.32 to 58.67) for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% without TP53, 15.0 months (95% CI:
4.34 to 25.66) for those with PDL1 < 1% with TP53, and not estimable for those with PDL1 ≥ 1% with
TP53. The log-rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.455).

When comparing TP53 mutation status (mutation or wild type) with the type of
immunotherapy treatment (pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab plus nivolumab), we observed
a significant difference in median OS. The median OS was 20.0 months for patients treated
with ipilimumab plus nivolumab without the TP53 mutation, 40.0 months for those treated
with pembrolizumab without the TP53 mutation, 21.0 months for patients treated with
ipilimumab plus nivolumab with the TP53 mutation, and 35.0 months for patients treated
with Pembrolizumab with the TP53 mutation, (p < 0.001), (Figure 9A). In terms of PFS, the
median was 12.0 months for patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab without
the TP53 mutation, 33.0 months for those treated with pembrolizumab without the TP53
mutation, 14.0 months for patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab with the TP53
mutation, and 21.0 months for those treated with pembrolizumab with the TP53 mutation,
(p < 0.001), (Figure 9B).

20.0 months (95% CI: 15.87 to 24.14) for patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab without
TP53 mutation, 40.0 months (95% CI: 31.60 to 48.40) for patients treated with pembrolizumab without
TP53 mutation, 21.0 months (95% CI: 15.04 to 26.96) for patients treated with ipilimumab plus
nivolumab with TP53 mutation, and 35.0 months (95% CI: 29.35 to 40.65) for patients treated with
pembrolizumab with TP53 mutation. The log-rank test indicated a statistically significant survival
difference between the groups (p < 0.001). (B) The median PFS was 12.0 months (95% CI: 10.24 to
13.75) for patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab without TP53 mutation, 33.0 months
(95% CI: 23.78 to 42.22) for patients treated with pembrolizumab without TP53 mutation, 14.0 months
(95% CI: 6.76 to 21.23) for patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab with TP53 mutation, and
21.0 months (95% CI: 5.79 to 36.21) for patients treated with pembrolizumab with TP53 mutation. The
log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001).

When comparing TP53 mutation status (mutation vs. wild type) with the type of
immunotherapy treatment (pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab plus nivolumab), we observed
distinct trends and significant differences based on histological subtype. Among SCC
patients, the results suggested a trend in median OS, with a median OS of 23.0 months for
those treated with IPI/NIVO without TP53 mutation, 53.0 months for those treated with
pembrolizumab without TP53 mutation, 20.0 months for those treated with ipilimumab plus
nivolumab with TP53 mutation, and not estimable for those treated with pembrolizumab
with TP53 mutation (p = 0.088), (Figure 10A). In contrast, among adenocarcinoma patients,
significant differences were observed in median OS, with a median OS of 18.0 months for
those treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab without TP53 mutation, 39.0 months for
those treated with pembrolizumab without TP53 mutation, 15.0 months for those treated
with ipilimumab plus nivolumab with TP53 mutation, and 32.0 months for those treated
with pembrolizumab with TP53 mutation (p < 0.001), (Figure 10B).

TP53 mutation. The log-rank test indicated a statistically significant survival difference between the
groups (p < 0.001).

3. Discussion

In the field of precision and personalized cancer therapy, precise tumor classification—
encompassing both histological subtypes and molecular pathological characteristics—is critical.
PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein that inhibits T-cell activity by binding to its
receptor, PD-1. ICIs, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, work by blocking this interaction,
thereby reactivating T-cell–mediated immune responses against tumor cells. High PD-L1
expression may suggest that tumor cells are more likely to respond to ICIs. Since PD-
L1 detection methods are well established, PD-L1 has become a practical and accessible
clinical biomarker. PD-L1 expression can be quantified using various scoring methods,
including tumor proportion score (TPS), tumor cells (TC), immune cells (IC), and combined
positive score (CPS). TPS refers to the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial
or complete membrane staining for PD-L1 out of all viable tumor cells in the sample. In
contrast, CPS incorporates PD-L1 expression on both tumor cells and tumor-associated
immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, offering a broader assessment of PD-L1
activity [23–26].

The influence of TP53 mutation status on survival outcomes for NSCLC patients
receiving chemo-immunotherapy remains an important area of investigation, though it is
not yet fully understood in both clinical trials and real-world settings. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to evaluate the impact of TP53 mutation in first-line, locally advanced,
and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with
a combination of chemo-immunotherapy. Our research focused on the prognostic effect of
TP53 mutation status on OS and PFS in a real-world cohort of patients with advanced or
metastatic adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Univariable analysis revealed
no significant improvement in either median PFS or OS between TP53 mutation and
wild-type groups.

Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings. In subgroup analysis, including
variables such as histological subtype (adenocarcinoma and SCC), treatment type (pem-
brolizumab and ipilimumab plus nivolumab), and TP53 mutation status, patients with
PD-L1 expression > 50% showed significant differences in both OS and PFS when treated
with chemo-immunotherapy. On the other hand, no differences were observed in OS or
PFS based on gender (male vs. female) or PD-L1 expression levels of 1–49% and <1%.

When comparing our results to the Check-Mate 9LA [27], KEYNOTE-189 [28], and
KEYNOTE-407 [29] trials, we observed some notable trends regarding TP53 status (muta-
tion vs. wild type). In our study, the comparison of immunotherapy regimens for NSCLC
patients revealed distinct patterns in median OS and median PFS based on both TP53 muta-
tion status and the type of immunotherapy used. For patients with SCC, there was a trend
toward OS benefit for the pembrolizumab group (p = 0.088); however, pembrolizumab
showed a trend toward better OS for those without TP53 mutation. In contrast, for pa-
tients with adenocarcinoma, pembrolizumab provided a statistically significant improve-
ment in OS compared to ipilimumab plus nivolumab, regardless of TP53 mutation status
(p < 0.001). Regarding PFS, pembrolizumab also demonstrated a significant advantage over
ipilimumab plus nivolumab in both the SCC and adenocarcinoma subgroups (p < 0.001).
This trend was consistent across both TP53 wild-type and mutant cohorts. Based on the
findings, pembrolizumab appears to be the superior immunotherapy treatment for patients
with adenocarcinoma, particularly in those without TP53 mutation, showing longer median
OS and median PFS. In comparing our results to those of the main clinical trials, the findings
from the CheckMate 9LA trial showed no statistically significant differences in median OS
for either adenocarcinoma or SCC, irrespective of TP53 status. Similarly, the KEYNOTE-189
and KEYNOTE-407 trials also did not demonstrate significant improvements in OS based
on TP53 status [27–29]. However, in a pooled analysis from the German National Network
Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer, which evaluated first-line treatment outcomes with pem-
brolizumab in non-squamous PD-L1 ≥ 50% patients according to KRAS/TP53 mutational
status, it was noted that G12C/TP53-mutated patients experienced the longest PFS and
OS (33.7 and 65.3 months, respectively; p = 0.002). The similarity between our cohort and
the German cohort lies in the fact that both were derived from similar geographical and
environmental settings, which may contribute to the observed outcomes [14]. While clinical
trials typically include patients from diverse regions, the shared local environment, and
potentially similar genetic backgrounds in both cohorts may offer a more consistent basis
for comparison. This could help explain the comparable results observed in our study
and the German study, suggesting that regional and environmental factors may play a
role in influencing patient responses to treatment, regardless of the differences in clinical
trial settings.

A meta-analysis of first-line treatment options for PD-L1–negative NSCLC concluded
that the combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab, and chemotherapy was likely the most
effective treatment based on treatment rankings [27]. In addition, real-world data indicated

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6939

14 of 19

that for metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression < 1%, the combination of
nivolumab, ipilimumab, and chemotherapy showed numerically better treatment responses
compared to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy [30,31]. Conversely, other real-world
data highlighted that in the low PD-L1 group, the median OS was 16 months for patients
treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab, compared to 12 months for those treated with
pembrolizumab (p = 0.02) [11]. Despite these findings, it remains unclear which treatment
approach—chemotherapy combined with either mono-immunotherapy (pembrolizumab)
or chemo-immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab)—is the optimal first-line therapy.
This uncertainty may be why many physicians prefer treating patients with TP53 mutations
or PD-L1 < 1% expression with ipilimumab plus nivolumab, as it is thought to address
the more aggressive mutation [30,31]. However, our findings suggest that TP53 mutation
status does not significantly affect survival outcomes in PD-L1 negative patients or those
with PD-L1 expression of 1–49%, nor does it appear to influence median PFS. While TP53
mutation may impact median OS in high PD-L1 expressing patients, it does not seem to
have an effect on PFS. Furthermore, in patients with PD-L1 expression > 1% or <1% and
different TP53 mutation statuses, our results indicate that both PD-L1 expression and TP53
mutation status influence median OS and PFS outcomes in this cohort.

It is well established in the literature that TP53 mutations in lung cancer do not sig-
nificantly differ in frequency between males and females [32–34]. However, in our study,
we observed a higher prevalence of TP53 mutations among male patients. This discrep-
ancy may be attributed to geographical and environmental factors, particularly smoking
behavior. In our cohort, the majority of male patients were smokers, whereas smoking is
relatively rare among women in our region. Given the known association between smoking
and increased risk of TP53 mutations, this may explain the higher mutation rate observed in
males in our study. Additionally, it is noteworthy that in our cohort, patients with positive
PD-L1 expression—known to be more prevalent among smokers—were also more likely to
harbor TP53 mutations, consistent with findings reported in the literature [35].

This study has several limitations. First, being a retrospective analysis, it is susceptible
to selection bias and incomplete data. Second, the data were collected from only three
institutions, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to a broader population.
Additionally, the relatively small sample size in certain subgroups may reduce the statistical
power of some analyses. To improve the robustness and generalizability of these findings,
future research should expand its scope by incorporating data from multiple centers or
even different countries, as well as including a larger cohort of patients. Moreover, since
this study compares only two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab vs.
nivolumab plus ipilimumab), future investigations should consider examining a wider
range of ICIs and their effects. Conducting multi-center, international studies with more
extensive patient cohorts will be crucial to validating and refining these results.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Cohort Selection (Study Population)

This retrospective, non-interventional observational study was conducted across
multiple institutions, focusing on patients diagnosed with NSCLC and TP53 mutations
who received chemo-immunotherapy (whether as pembrolizumab or ipilimumab plus
nivolumab) as their first-line treatment between January 2018 and January 2024. Data
collection continued until September 2024, the date of the last follow-up. The data gathered
included patient demographics (age at diagnosis, sex), treatment regimen, OS, PFS, therapy
start and end dates, smoking history, metastasis sites, PD-L1 values, date of last follow-
up, progression sites; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status scores.

All patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, which included radiologists,
medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pulmonologists, pathologists, thoracic surgeons,
and nuclear medicine physicians. These evaluations were based on pathological findings,
imaging results, and the patient’s performance status. A primary physician was assigned
to each patient, responsible for overseeing their treatment. For patients diagnosed with
advanced or metastatic disease (any T, N 1–3, and/or M1), medical oncologists took the
lead in managing their care, following the treatment guidelines established by the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [22], in addition the reporting of this study
conforms to the observational studies statement.

4.2. Treatment and Protocols Administrated
4.2.1. Patients Diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma

Each treatment cycle, lasting three weeks, began with intravenous administration of
cisplatin at 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area or carboplatin, with the dosage
adjusted according to the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC of 6–4), based
on the patient’s performance status. This was paired with pemetrexed, dosed at 500 mg
per square meter of body-surface area. In addition, nivolumab was given intravenously at
360 mg every three weeks, and ipilimumab was administered at 1 mg/kg every six weeks.
After the first two cycles, the platinum-based chemotherapy agent was discontinued, and
pemetrexed, nivolumab, and ipilimumab continued as maintenance therapy, in accordance
with the Checkmate 9LA trial protocol [27]. Alternatively, pembrolizumab was used instead
of nivolumab and ipilimumab, after the initial four cycles, with the platinum agent discon-
tinued, following the Keynote 189 [28] trial regimen. Pembrolizumab was administered
intravenously at 200 mg every three weeks, alongside pemetrexed. The treatment was
planned to continue for up to two years or until the development of unacceptable toxicity
or disease progression. All patients were premedicated with folic acid, vitamin B12, and
glucocorticoids in line with institutional guidelines before receiving pemetrexed.

4.2.2. Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Each treatment cycle, lasting three weeks, began with intravenous administration of
cisplatin at 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area or carboplatin, adjusted based
on the AUC of 4–6, depending on the patient’s performance status. This was combined
with paclitaxel at 175 mg per square meter of body-surface area. Additionally, nivolumab
was administered intravenously at a dose of 360 mg every three weeks, and ipilimumab at
1 mg/kg every six weeks. Following the first two cycles, chemotherapy agents (paclitaxel
and platinum) were discontinued, and nivolumab and ipilimumab continued as mainte-
nance immunotherapy, following the regimen outlined in the Checkmate 9LA trial [27].
Alternatively, pembrolizumab was used in place of nivolumab and ipilimumab after the
initial four cycles, with the chemotherapy agents discontinued. Pembrolizumab was ad-
ministered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks, as per the Keynote 407
trial protocol [29]. This treatment regimen was intended to be administered for up to two
years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.

4.3. Inclusion Criteria

Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they met the following criteria:
Age 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC without
driver mutations.

4.4. Exclusion Criteria

Patients were excluded from the study if they had received any systemic cancer
therapy within the four years preceding the study. This exclusion was necessary to prevent
previous treatments from affecting the study’s results.

4.5. Patient Monitoring, Clinical Information, and Data Collection

Before starting treatment, patients underwent disease staging, which included brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), total-body computed tomography (CT) scans, or fluo-
rodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).
Measurable target lesions, including those with NSCLC epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations identified through follow-up or imaging, were evaluated. Oncologists
assessed treatment responses using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RE-
CIST). Safety monitoring was performed according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Throughout the treatment period, radiologic
assessments, including brain MRI, CT, or FDG-PET-CT, were conducted every three to
four months.

4.6. Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the baseline demographic, clinical, and
molecular characteristics of the patients. Continuous data with non-normal distributions
were presented as medians (range), while categorical variables were reported as frequencies
(percentages). Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were conducted to evaluate OS and PFS
based on the presence or absence of TP53 mutations. These analyses were further stratified
by key clinical factors, including PD-L1 expression levels, type of ICI, and histological
diagnosis. Log-rank tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of differ-
ences in survival distributions. Multivariable analyses for PFS and OS were carried out
using Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All p-values were two-sided, with a
significance threshold set at p < 0.05. The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS
software, version 29.0.

5. Conclusions

This study underscores the potential impact of TP53 mutation status and the type of
immunotherapy treatment on survival outcomes in both SCC and adenocarcinoma lung
cancer patients. Our findings suggest that both PD-L1 expression (whether >1% or <1%)
and TP53 mutation status play a crucial role in influencing median PFS and OS outcomes
in this cohort. The log-rank test revealed a statistically significant difference in survival
between the subgroups. Specifically, for adenocarcinoma patients, our results indicate that
PD-L1 expression levels and TP53 mutation status are significant factors affecting both OS
and PFS, highlighting their potential relevance in predicting patient prognosis.
