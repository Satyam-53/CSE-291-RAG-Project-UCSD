The tumour suppressor gene p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in lung cancer and these defects are associated with
poor prognosis, albeit some debate exists in the lung cancer ﬁeld. Despite extensive research, the exact mechanisms by which
mutant p53 proteins promote the development and sustained expansion of cancer remain unclear. This review will discuss the
cellular responses controlled by p53 that contribute to tumour suppression, p53 mutant lung cancer mouse models and
characterisation of p53 mutant lung cancer. Furthermore, we discuss potential approaches of targeting mutant p53 for the
treatment of lung cancer.

THE TUMOUR SUPPRESSOR P53
The p53 gene (generic name used here, also known as TP53 in
humans and Trp53 in mouse) encodes the tumour suppressor
protein p53 (TP53/TRP53), a transcription factor that can regulate
diverse cellular processes, including apoptotic cell death, adapta-
tion of cellular metabolism, cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence
and DNA damage repair [1]
In unstressed cells, p53
proteins levels are kept low, since it is ubiquitinated by the E3
ligase mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) (called HDM2 in humans),
thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Stress condi-
tions, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation or
oncogene activation, lead to the inhibition of MDM2 and/or direct
modiﬁcation of p53,
resulting in the stabilisation and thus
activation of the p53 protein. p53 proteins then bind as homo-
tetramers to the promoter regions of ~500 direct target genes and
induce their expression to activate apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA
repair and other cellular processes [2].

by p53. However, numerous studies have shown that additional

processes that can be induced by p53 and how they contribute to
tumour suppression will be discussed individually.

APOPTOSIS
Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is important for
embryonic development, and the maintenance of tissue homo-
eostasis by removing no longer needed or potentially dangerous

(e.g. infected or early neoplastic) cells [3–5]. Apoptosis can occur
through two distinct yet converging pathways, the intrinsic (aka
mitochondrial,
stress-induced or BCL-2 regulated, BAX/BAK-
dependent) or extrinsic (aka death receptor-induced) pathways
[6]. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is regulated by the proteins of
the B cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family [7]. The BCL-2 family of
proteins are divided into three subgroups: (1) the pro-apoptotic
BH3-only proteins, such as Bcl-2 Interacting Mediator of cell death
(BIM), the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (NOXA), which
are initiators of apoptosis; (2) the pro-survival proteins, such as
BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1, which are the guardians that inhibit
apoptosis; and (3) the pro-apoptotic effectors of apoptosis, BAX,
BAK (and BOK), with the ﬁrst two inhibited by the pro-survival BCL-
2 proteins in healthy cells [6]. The genes that encode the BH3-only
proteins, PUMA and NOXA, have been identiﬁed as direct target
genes of p53, whereas the gene that encodes the BH3-only
protein BIM can be indirectly induced by p53 [8, 9]. Upon certain

survival BCL-2 proteins, leading to the activation of the effectors of
apoptosis, BAX and BAK. It has been reported that BAX and BAK
can also be directly activated by some BH3-only proteins [7]. When
activated, BAX and BAK oligomerise and cause mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP). This leads to the
release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c and SMAC/
DIABLO into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds to apoptotic
peptidase-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and this adaptor platform
induces activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9. Caspase-9
then proteolytically activates the downstream effector caspases
(i.e. caspases-3, (-6) and -7) and this caspase cascade causes the
ordered dismantling of the dying cells [7]. The extrinsic apoptotic

Fig. 1 Cellular processes regulated by p53. p53 regulates diverse cellular processes via the transcriptional regulation of target genes. Some
cellular processes that contribute to the tumour suppressive function of p53 include apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, DNA repair
and cell metabolism. Some genes essential for carrying out these processes are indicated.

pathway is triggered by the stimulation of death receptors, such
as FAS, by their ligands, such as FASL, on the plasma membrane.
This activates the initiator caspase, caspase-8, through the adaptor
protein FADD. Activated caspase-8 can trigger apoptosis either
directly by proteolytically activating the downstream effector
caspases, caspases-3, (-6) and -7, however can also proteolytically
activate the BH3-only protein BID, thereby increasing effector
caspase activation by engaging the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
(see above)
[10]. p53 is thought to also be involved in the
regulation of the death receptor apoptotic pathway by upregulat-
ing target genes, such as those for FAS [11, 12], Death Receptor 5
(DR5) [13], TNF receptor-associated protein 4 (TRAF4) [14] and
SUSD6 (DRAGO; TMPS; KIAA0247) [15, 16]. Of note, cells lacking
FAS (e.g. from lpr mutant mice) or cells overall deﬁcient in death
lacking FADD function) are
receptor-induced apoptosis (e.g.
resistant to apoptosis induced by activation of p53 by γ-radiation
or DNA damage-inducing drugs [17]. Therefore, the upregulation
of these genes by p53 possibly serves to sensitise cells to
apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which
can express the ligands for death receptors.

The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis was ﬁrst revealed in a
study using a myeloid leukaemia cell line in which expression of
wildtype (WT) p53 was induced [18]. Subsequently, using gene
knockout mice, it was shown that p53 is essential for the induction
of apoptosis triggered by agents that cause DNA damage,
including γ-radiation and certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such
as etoposide or cisplatin [19–21]. Later work demonstrated that
the combined absence of the p53 target genes encoding the pro-
apoptotic BH3-only proteins PUMA and NOXA (and to a lesser

extent loss of PUMA alone) rendered lymphoid cells as resistant to
DNA damage-inducing agents as loss of p53 itself [8, 9, 22]. This
demonstrated that transcriptional induction of PUMA and NOXA
accounts for all p53-induced apoptosis. As soon as p53 was shown
to be able to induce apoptosis it was predicted that this is one of,
if not the sole, mechanism by which p53 prevents tumorigenesis.
Consistent with this notion, loss of PUMA accelerates c-MYC over-
expression induced lymphoma development in mice [23]. How-
ever, even combined loss of PUMA and NOXA accelerated c-MYC
induced lymphomagenesis to a considerably lesser extent than
loss of only a single allele of p53 (p53+/−) [23]. This demonstrates
that p53 must suppress tumour development not only through
induction of apoptosis, but also through activation of additional
processes.

CELL CYCLE ARREST AND CELL SENESCENCE
Cell cycle arrest and cell senescence, the latter a process of
irreversible cell cycle arrest, are protective mechanisms for
maintaining tissue homoeostasis, and can function as comple-
mentary mechanisms to programmed cell death for tumour
suppression [24]. Cell cycle arrest and cell senescence can be
triggered by shortening of telomeres, a feature of aged cells, as
well as in response to various environmental and cellular stresses,
such as nutrient deprivation, DNA damage and oncogene
expression. One of the most extensively studied pathways of
induction of cell cycle arrest and cell senescence is through the
direct transcriptional
induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21 by p53, resulting in arrest at the G1/S boundary [25].

In addition to proliferation arrest, senescent cells also exhibit

metabolism with the activation of the so-called senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP), whereby the cells secrete
cytokines, chemokines and proteases, that have profound effects
on neighbouring cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME)
[26–28].

transformation of

p53 has been shown to be essential for oncogene-induced
senescence [29]. For example, the expression of mutant Rat
sarcoma virus (RAS) in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts results in
permanent G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by a signiﬁcant
increase in the level of p53 and the expression of many of its
target genes, including p21. The loss or mutation of p53 prevents
mutant RAS induced cell cycle arrest and senescence, thereby
promoting the malignant
these cells [30].
However, in recent years some studies have provided evidence
that senescent cells can under certain conditions also promote
tumorigenesis [31, 32]. The depletion of senescent cells in aging
mice delayed age-related morbidity and decreased the incidence
of tumorigenesis and cancer-related death [33]. This is thought to
be due to the removal of
the SASP that may promote
tumorigenesis by inducing chronic inﬂammation, a known driver
of tumorigenesis [27, 32, 34]. Moreover, it has been reported that
under certain conditions senescent cancer cells are capable of
exiting from their growth arrested state,
thereby re-starting
tumour expansion [35]. These features of senescent cells are
identiﬁed as the emerging hallmarks and enabling characteristics
of cancer [24].

Although p53 induced apoptosis via PUMA and NOXA and cell
senescence via p21 play critical roles in preventing cells from
malignant transformation, these two mechanisms are dispensable
for p53-mediated suppression of spontaneous tumour develop-
ment. Remarkably, none of Puma−/−, Noxa−/−, Puma−/−;Noxa−/−
or even Puma−/−;Noxa−/−;p21−/− mice spontaneously developed
tumours even when aged to >450 days. In contrast, p53−/− mice
(on a C57BL/6 background) develop tumours spontaneously with
a 100% incidence within 280 days [36, 37]. Similarly, mice with p53
mutations that impair the transcriptional activation of p21, Puma
and Noxa, but retain the ability to induce the transcription of
certain other p53 target genes, also do not develop tumours
spontaneously [38]. Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate that p53-
mediated tumour suppression is a complex process and that p53
than Puma, Noxa and p21 and cellular
target genes other
processes in addition to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest/cell
senescence must also be involved.

DNA DAMAGE REPAIR
DNA damage repair is a critical cellular response to maintain
genomic integrity after the exposure to endogenous or exogen-
ous DNA damaging agents [39]. Failure of DNA damage repair can
result in genomic instability and mutations, and this is also
identiﬁed as a hallmark of cancer [5]. Several DNA damage
response processes operate in cells to prevent propagation of
DNA lesions. For example, nucleotide excision repair
(NER)
removes adducts of DNA lesions commonly caused by UV
irradiation and is one of the major mechanisms that protect cells
from neoplasm, mutagenesis and cytotoxicity [40]. On the other
hand, base excision repair (BER) corrects oxidative modiﬁcations of
the DNA bases [41]. DNA double stranded breaks (DSB) are
typically induced by ionising radiation or spontaneously during
DNA replication. These lesions are repaired through homologous
recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

Many studies have provided evidence that p53 plays an
important role in maintaining genome stability and suppressing
tumorigenesis by activating a variety of DNA damage repair

pathways [42]. The earliest connection between p53 and NER was
demonstrated by Smith et al., where they found that human cells
in which normal p53 function was disrupted by either the human
papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein or expression of a transgene
encoding a dominant-negative mutant of p53 showed signiﬁ-
cantly reduced tolerance to UV irradiation [43].
In BER, various
interactions were described between p53 and APE1/Ref-1, the
apurinic and apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases that are essential for
the removal of damaged bases and subsequently the repair of the
AP sites [44, 45]. It was reported that APE1/Ref-1 can promote the
tetramerization of p53 [46] and regulate its trans-activation and
pro-apoptotic functions [44].
Interestingly, p53 was found to
directly supress the transcription of APE1. This function is thought
to be related to the tumour suppressive role of p53, as the
downregulation of BER can bias the cellular response towards
apoptosis in cells with highly damaged DNA [47]. Functions of p53
in MMR are mainly exerted through its transcriptional induction of
the gene encoding the MMR core component MSH2. However,
MSH2 is also found to function in NER, BER and HR. Therefore, p53-
dependent induction of MSH2 expression may also be involved in
other DNA damage repair pathways [42]. Additionally, p53 has
been shown to activate the HR pathway by both direct and
indirect interactions with RAD51 [48–52]. Other studies have
shown that p53 can also mediate HR by interacting with other
proteins, such as the ATM/ATR checkpoint kinases [53]. The role of
p53 in NHEJ is less well studied compared to those in HR. It is
known that p53 can promote NHEJ by interacting with
components of the NHEJ pathway, such as XRCC4 and DNA ligase
IV [54–56]. However,
these
interactions remain largely unclear. Recently, a p53-dependent
gene ring ﬁnger protein 144b (Rnf144b) has been found to be
involved in the repair of DNA DSBs and is shown to have a pivotal
tumour suppressive function, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma
[57]. In addition, an in vivo shRNA library screen and validation
using CRISPR induced gene deletion revealed that the loss of
several p53-regulated DNA repair genes can markedly accelerate
c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis and the removal of Mlh1, a key
gene involved in MMR, can even on its own promote spontaneous
tumour development [58]. Overall, these ﬁndings demonstrate
that coordination of DNA damage repair contributes substantially
to p53-mediated tumour suppression.

the molecular mechanisms of

ADAPTATION OF CELL METABOLISM
Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 may also prevent
tumour development through the regulation of cell metabolism.
The emerging role of p53 in metabolic rewiring in cancer has been
comprehensively explored in several recent reviews [59–61], and
we discuss this topic here only relatively brieﬂy. p53 has been
reported to play important roles in the control of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a cellular process that
produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP). p53 enhances OXPHOS
by inducing the expression of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2). In
addition, p53 is known to negatively regulate cellular glycolysis by
directly or
indirectly inhibiting the expression of glucose
transporters (GLUTs) or the translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma
membrane, leading to decreased glucose uptake [62–64]. p53 can
also inﬂuence glucose metabolism by direct or indirect regulation
of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in this
process, such as p53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator
(TIGAR)
[65]. The activation of TIGAR leads to a decrease in
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which subsequently halts glycolysis.
the absence of Tigar does not promote tumour

development, indicating that it does not exert a pivotal role in
p53-mediated tumour suppression [66].

p53 can also negatively regulate other cellular pathways
involved in glycolysis, such as the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway
to suppress glycolysis in cells [67–69]. Tumour cells often undergo

metabolic reprogramming to support increased cell growth and
proliferation. Most tumours experience a signiﬁcant increase in
glycolysis due to insufﬁcient OXPHOS, which was ﬁrst discovered
by Warburg et al. and was named as the Warburg effect [70].
Recent studies suggest that mutations or loss of p53 in tumours
could be a leading factor that results in the Warburg effect [71].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of OXPHOS
generated when cells sustain genotoxic damage or mitochondrial
stress and they are known to contribute to tissue damage and
tumorigenesis [71].

Furthermore, p53 has been shown to regulate cell metabolism
through crosstalk with various cellular pathways, such as the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) pathways [72]. The mTOR pathway can be activated by
high levels of nutrients and energy, such as a high ATP/ADP ratio,
growth factors and oxygen, which promote anabolism and inhibit
catabolism [72, 73]. Conversely, a low energy state (i.e. a low ATP/ADP
ratio) activates AMPK, which in turn promotes catabolism and inhibits
anabolism [72, 74]. AMPK and mTOR are key regulators of autophagy,
which is a self-eating process to degrade proteins, organelles and
membranes, thereby recycling macromolecules for production of
energy in response to cellular stress [75]. Several studies have
suggested that WT p53 can induce autophagy in cancer cells via the
activation of AMPK and the suppression of mTOR by transcriptional
induction of the genes encoding phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN) and tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) [76–79], whereas autophagy is
inhibited in p53 mutant cancer cells [80, 81]. Moreover, cancer cells
expressing mutant p53 exhibit
increased sensitivity to mTOR
inhibition compared to cancer cells with WT p53 [81]. This supports
the importance of p53 in regulating the mTOR signalling pathway to
suppress tumour development. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest
critical, albeit not yet well understood, roles of p53 in metabolic
regulation and the prevention of tumorigenesis.

P53 MUTANT CANCERS
p53 mutations occur
in ~50% of human cancers and are
commonly associated with poor therapy responses and poor
patient outcomes [82]. People with Li-Fraumeni syndrome that
inherit one mutant p53 allele and one WT p53 allele have an ~50%
likelihood of developing cancer by the age of 35 and a ~90% risk
of developing cancer throughout their lifetime [83]. Although over
2000 different mutations in the p53 gene have been reported in
human cancers [84], most mutations occur at six hotspot amino
acid residues in the DNA-binding domain (R175, G245, R248, R249,
R273 and R282) [85]. Mutations have also been found in other
domains of p53, but their effects on tumorigenesis are less well

speciﬁc mutations can be
for
(i)
preferentially enriched due to differences in mutational aetiolo-
gies (e.g. exposure to different carcinogens), and (ii) individual
hotspot mutations may exhibit distinct tumorigenic potential in
different tissues [89]. Mutant p53 is proposed to promote tumour
development in three ways (Fig. 2). (1) Loss of function (LOF)
effects abrogate normal p53-mediated cellular processes, leading
to defects in cell cycle arrest, evasion of apoptosis and genomic
instability [90]. (2) Dominant negative effects (DNE) are thought to
result from the formation of mixed tetramers containing both WT
p53 and mutant p53 proteins. In this setting, such mixed tetramers
are signiﬁcantly less efﬁcient at activating target genes compared
to WT p53 homo-tetramers [1]. The DNE of mutant p53 can be
critical during early stages of tumour development when cells
express both the WT and mutant p53 alleles [85], as at diagnosis
most mutant p53 expressing cancers have lost the WT p53 allele
(loss of heterozygosity). (3) The reported gain of function (GOF)
effects of mutant p53 proteins are thought to be exerted by
binding to and modulating the functions of certain transcription
factors (e.g. erythroblast transformation speciﬁc proteins) that are
not bound and impacted by WT p53 [82, 88]. Indeed, enforced
expression of mutant p53 in p53-deﬁcient mouse or human cell
lines has been reported to lead to new phenotypes [91],
supporting the GOF effects of mutant p53. Moreover, previous
studies showed that different p53 mutations may have distinct
oncogenic properties, and these mutations may promote tumour
development beyond the LOF effect. For example, several mouse
models have shown that certain mutant p53 proteins are able to
enhance the invasion and motility of cancer cells compared to
In addition, Li-

Fraumeni patients with certain hotspot p53 mutations, such as
R248Q, show earlier onset of malignant disease compared with
patients that harbour mutations that cause a loss of p53 protein
[96]. This may, however, also be ascribed to the DNE of R248Q
mutant p53 protein. The relative importance of the LOF, DNE and
GOF effects of mutant p53 in the initiation, sustained growth and
metastasis of cancer is still hotly debated, as is how the different
p53 mutations affect these tumorigenic processes. Adding to the
complexity, p53 mutations have been reported to occur at
different stages of malignant transformation [97]. It is therefore
possible that mutant p53 proteins may contribute differently to
tumorigenesis depending on the timing of the acquisition of the
mutation and the context of co-existing oncogenic drivers. This
still requires substantial further investigation.

histopathological subtypes. Approximately 15% percent of lung
cancer cases are classiﬁed as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The
remaining ~85% of cases are classiﬁed as non-small cell
lung
cancer (NSCLC), which can be further divided into adenocarci-
noma (LUAD; ~40% of NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC,
~25% of NSCLC) and large cell carcinoma (~15% of NSCLC) [99].

LUAD, the most prevalent subtype of NSCLC,

is char-
acterised by its glandular differentiation and is located most
frequently in the periphery of the lung [100]. The genomic
is distinct between
landscape of
different lung cancer subtypes, and a number of molecular
subtypes have been identiﬁed in LUAD based on their
oncogenic drivers [99]. For example, activating mutations of
the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
the genes encoding
or KRAS, or
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1
(ROS1) have led to the oncogene-centric molecular classi-
ﬁcation of NSCLC [101]. Although there are known associa-
tions between subtypes of
lung cancer with distinct
oncogenic drivers and their histological appearance as well
as growth patterns [102], tumours driven by the same
oncogenic alterations can exhibit signiﬁcant molecular and
clinical heterogeneity [101]. This is in part due to the
diversity of oncogenes that drive the different cases of lung
[103]. For example, KRAS mutations have been
cancer
observed in various codons, with the majority of mutations
occurring at codon 12, while mutations at codons 13, 10 and
61 are less frequent [103]. In NSCLC, the most common KRAS
mutations include KRASG12C (39%), KRASG12V (18–21%) and
KRASG12D (17–18%)
[104]. The G12D mutation is more
common in non-smoking NSCLC patients, whereas the
G12C mutation is more prevalent
in smoking NSCLC
patients [105, 106]. These different amino acid substitutions
exert distinct impact on the downstream mitogen-activated

protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, involving PI3K/
AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEKK) and
RAS-like (RAL) GTPases. These are important factors that
contribute to the overall survival
(OS) and therapeutic
response of lung cancer patients [103]. These subgroups of
KRAS-mutant LUAD exhibit different
responses to anti-
cancer therapeutics and have distinct impact on the TME
[101, 107]. There is emerging evidence that co-occurrence of
speciﬁc mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor
genes can contribute to the molecular and clinical hetero-
geneity in lung cancer [101]. For example, mutations of p53,
mutations or loss of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) (also known as
serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11)), which is frequently
associated with the loss of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
1 (KEAP1), and bi-allelic inactivation of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 2A (CDKN2B) have been identiﬁed as three major
co-occurring genetic alterations in KRAS-mutant LUAD. Like
for many other cancers, mutations in p53 are common in
lung cancer and certain hotspot mutants predominate. The
most common p53 mutations in human LUAD occur at
codon R273, while mutations at R175, which frequently
occur in other cancer types, are less common in LUAD [108]

reported on the role of p53 mutations as a prognostic
marker [109–113],
likely due to the differing functional
effects of speciﬁc p53 mutations. These ﬁndings highlight
the importance of further categorising lung cancers with
mutant KRAS and mutant p53 based on their genotype,
including particular mutations in p53.

Conventional therapies for NSCLC include surgery, radio-
therapy and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination
[114]. Surgical resection is recommended for patients with
early-stage NSCLC without other morbidities
[115].
Platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g. cisplatin) in combina-
tion with other cytotoxic agents are standard regimens for
patients with advanced lung cancer and they have been

Immunotherapy is a new modality for cancer
therapy.
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agents, such as anti-
bodies that inhibit PD-(L)1 or CTLA-4, have been used with
success in the treatment of many cancers, including NSCLC
[117]. This has demonstrated higher clinical efﬁcacy
compared with conventional
therapies in NSCLC [117].
However, only a small subset of patients experience durable
anti-tumour
responses upon anti-PD-1 treatment, and
accurate biomarkers predictive of response to such thera-
pies are yet to be deﬁned [118]. Targeted therapy has
transformed the therapeutic landscape of lung cancer over
few decades. The identiﬁcation of
the past

genetic alterations has allowed for individualised therapies,
and this has signiﬁcantly improved the response rate and
progression-free survival. Current Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA)-approved targeted therapies include tyrosine
kinase inhibitors inhibiting EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, BRAF
V600E, MET Exon14 or NTRK [114]. For decades, KRAS was
considered an elusive target for direct inhibition. Recently,

has been approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment
for patients with advanced KRASG12C mutant NSCLC. This
treatment has demonstrated remarkable efﬁcacy with
substantial response and disease control rates [119, 120].
A second KRASG12C inhibitor, adagrasib (MRTX849), has also
produced promising outcomes in clinical trials [121, 122]
and several other KRASG12C inhibitors have entered clinical
studies [123]. However, there are currently no approved
inhibitors of other KRAS mutants. Recent studies have
reported that two drugs, MRTX1133 and BI-KRASG12D1-3,
are able to selectively inhibit the viability of KRASG12D
mutant tumour cells in clinical trials [123].
In addition,
several
indirect pan-KRAS inhibitors are currently under
investigation [124, 125].

ii. Small cell lung cancer

SCLC is a clinically and histologically distinct subgroup of
lung cancer and is identiﬁed as one of the high-grade lung
cancers of neuroendocrine origin [100]. This is a highly
aggressive disease due to its high growth rate, early
metastasis and poor prognosis. As a result, more than
two-thirds of patients present with metastatic SCLC at the
time of diagnosis [126]. Over 90% of SCLC patients are
current or past smokers, and the risk of SCLC increases with
smoking duration and intensity [127]. Unlike NSCLC, the
classiﬁcation of SCLC is not deﬁned by its
somatic
mutations, but according to the expression of
lineage-
speciﬁc transcription factors. In seminal ﬁndings by Rudin
et al., SCLC subtypes were deﬁned by the expression of four
transcription factors: achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1),
neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1),
yes-
associated protein 1 (YAP1) and POU class 2 homeobox 3
(POU2F3)
[128]. Notably, SCLC tumour cells expressing
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 exhibit neuroendocrine features
whereas those expressing YAP1 and POU2F3 exhibit a
neuroendocrine low phenotype [129–131]. However, there
is increasing evidence that YAP1 does not deﬁne a distinct
subtype of SCLC.
Instead, a group of SCLC tumours was
identiﬁed with low expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1 and
POU2F3. This subtype shows a unique gene expression
signature involving human leucocyte antigens and many
immune checkpoint regulators, including PD-L1 and CTLA-4.
Therefore, this subtype is called SCLC-Inﬂamed and has
been found to show greater
response to ICB therapy
compared with other subtypes of SCLC [132]. To date, no

deﬁnitive positive selection marker exist to identify this rarer
subtype of SCLC tumours [132].

alterations, such as the loss of PTEN, NOTCH receptors and
the CREB binding protein, are also observed and the
importance of these defects has been functionally validated
in vivo and in vitro [126]. Epigenetic and transcriptomic
analyses have identiﬁed the ampliﬁcation of the MYC family
proto-oncogenes (MYC, MYCL and MYCN) [136], with MYCL
being associated with the ASCL1-subtype and MYC being
associated with other subtypes [126].

tion of the mutant MYC protein was shown to promote cell
transformation and the proliferation of lung cancer cells
[128].

In addition,

The standard treatment for patients with limited-stage
SCLC is concurrent
radiation and chemotherapy which
typically includes platinum-based agents in combination
with etoposide [137]. About 20% patients will achieve long-
term control of malignant disease. However, disease relapse
occurs in most patients, probably due to the selection for
surviving treatment insensitive malignant cells, possibly so-
called cancer stem cells [138]. Patients with metastatic
disease are treated with platinum plus etoposide combina-
tion therapy. Recently, several studies have demonstrated
that
in
immunotherapy such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies,
addition to the standard platinum plus etoposide regimen
can improve the progression-free and OS in a small subset
of these patients [139–141]. Despite the beneﬁts brought by
immunotherapies, SCLC still remains a largely lethal disease
and there are no approved targeted therapies for SCLC.
Therefore, a better understanding of the biology of SCLC is
urgently required to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities.

INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF MUTANT P53 IN LUNG CANCER
FROM MOUSE MODELS
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) enlighten the
study of human cancers, as the gene modiﬁcations in GEMMs
mimic the oncogenic mutations underpinning cancer formation in
humans and enable the study of speciﬁc oncogenic driver events.
Mutations of KRAS (32%) and p53 (46%) are two of the most
common gene mutations in LUAD and the co-occurrence of these
two gene mutations is frequently observed [99]. In GEMMs of lung
cancer, the KrasLSL-G12D/+ mouse model is the most widely used
mutation for the study of KRAS-mutant LUAD. In this model a lox-
stop-lox (LSL) cassette was inserted upstream of the transcriptional
start site within a mutant KrasG12D allele knocked into the
endogenous Kras gene. Intra-nasal delivery of a CRE recombinase
results in DNA recombination between the loxP sites, leading to
the removal of the stop codon and consequently the expression of
mutant Kras [142]. The expression of oncogenic KRASG12D protein
in murine lung epithelial cells induces the formation of adenomas
that recapitulate early-stage lesions observed in human LUAD
[142]. The KrasLSL-G12D/+ mouse model of
lung cancer with
conditional inactivation of the p53 allele was ﬁrst generated by
the Jacks Laboratory [89]. In addition to the modiﬁcation of the
Kras allele in a more aggressive model, exons 2–10 of the p53
allele are also ﬂanked by loxP sites, which results in the deletion of
the p53 allele when CRE is expressed [89]. Loss of p53 cooperates
with oncogenic Kras to induce LUAD with increased invasiveness
and accelerates the progression from adenomas to adenocarci-
nomas [89]. Other studies using Kras-mutant LUAD mouse models

promotes disease progression of mutant Kras-driven lung
tumours, and certain point mutations have been reported to
contribute to tumorigenesis through DNE and/or GOF effects [89].
A previous study comparing the conditional mutations of p53LSL-
R270H, p53LSL-R172H and the p53ﬂ/ﬂ allele in the KrasLSL-G12D/+ mouse
model of LUAD revealed that while for all alterations the LOF
effects were sufﬁcient to promote Kras-initiated LUAD and drive
metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant organ sites, such
as kidney in a small number of mice, the transcriptional processes
governed by p53 to elicit this metastatic phenotype is however
poorly understood. Of note, p53R270H but not p53R172H also acted in
a dominant-negative manner in promoting tumorigenesis when
the other allele was WT for p53. Moreover, the expression of
mutant p53 was found to contribute to tumour heterogeneity by
promoting the development of sino-nasal adenocarcinomas,
which was not observed in tumours with a p53-deﬁcient state
[89]. These Kras/p53 compound mutant mouse models recapitu-
late several characteristics of advanced human LUAD that are not
commonly observed in the Kras-mutant/p53-deﬁcient mouse
models. Despite all the discoveries made from studies using these
mouse models, which demonstrate the importance of p53 in lung
cancer, the mechanism by which p53 suppresses lung cancer
development remains unclear. Recently, a study by Kaiser et al.
comparing the Kras-mutant LUAD mouse models with p53
knockout, WT p53 or hyperactive p53 alleles with enhanced
tumour suppressor activity has revealed the role of p53 loss in the
initiation and progression of LUAD.
It was found that tumour
suppression by p53 in this setting involves the repurposing of the
role of p53 in tissue repair, whereby p53 promotes alveolar type 1
cell differentiation of transitional (i.e. early neoplastic) cancer cells.
Inactivation of p53 leads to the inappropriate persistence of
transitional cancer cells thereby promoting progression of LUAD
[144] (Table 1).

Numerous GEMMs have been developed to study SCLC, with
almost all of them containing conditional alleles of Rb1 (ﬂoxed exon

Oncogene (2025) 44:115 – 129

19) and p53 (ﬂoxed exons 2–10).
In these mice aggressive
neuroendocrine lung tumours can be induced upon intra-nasal or
intra-tracheal delivery of Adeno-Cre viruses [145]. Additional deletion
of Pten or Rbl2 and stabilisation/over-expression of MYC have been
shown to further accelerate tumorigenesis and promote metastasis in
these SCLC mouse models initiated by the loss of Rb1 and p53
[146–148]. For example, the p53/Rbl1/Pten triple knockout mouse
model exhibits variant characteristics of SCLC as well as large cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma and NSCLC [146]. Conversely, the p53/Rb1/
Rbl2 triple knockout mouse model shares similar features with the
p53/Rb1 double knockout model, and they both reliably recapitulate
the ASCL1-high/NEUROD1-low subtype of human SCLC [148].
In
contrast, the p53/Rb1 double knockout model with Cre-activated
mutant MycT58A that leads to stabilised MYC proteins, is representative
of the variant subtype of human SCLC [149]. Tumour cells with this
genotype display a high level of plasticity, with an ASCL1-high/
NEUROD1-low phenotype at early-stage disease and a NEUROD1-
high/ASCL1-low phenotype in invasive late-stage tumours [148]
(Table 1). These observations suggest a possible plasticity between
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 tumour cell phenotypes and implicate MYC as a
driver of this process.

It was hypothesised that when WT p53 expression is introduced
into tumour cells, the WT p53 proteins will be activated and stabilised
due to stress stimuli, such as oncogene expression, hyperproliferative
signals and DNA damage. This would then lead to activation of p53
target genes and the subsequent
induction of apoptosis or
senescence of tumour cells [150]. This hypothesis has been tested
in GEMMs of various cancers including lymphoma, lung cancer and
liver carcinoma [151–154]. In a WT p53 restorable mouse model of
LUAD, the LSL-WT p53 allele in the mice is phenotypically identical to
the knockout state of the allele, but the expression of WT p53 can be
induced upon the removal of LSL by a CRE recombinase [151]. Using
this mouse model in concert with activation of oncogenic KrasG12D, it
was found that the induced expression of WT p53 eliminates high-
grade tumours but not low-grade adenoma lesions [154–156]. Similar
results were observed in other NSCLC mouse models containing LSL-
KrasG12D and p53ERTAM alleles, whereby p53 can be switched between
the knockout and the WT state by tamoxifen administration [154]. In

122

T. Chen et al.

SCLC, the Rb1ﬂ/ﬂ;p53XTR/XTR;Rbl2ﬂ/ﬂ mouse model was used to assess
the effects of p53 restoration on tumour expansion. In this model, WT
p53 can be inactivated by a CRE recombinase and then restored by a
FlpO recombinase.
It was found that p53 restoration limited the
growth and metastasis of autochthonous SCLC. Intertumoral hetero-
geneity was observed between SCLC tumour subtypes in response to
the restoration of WT p53, such that this led to cell senescence in a
subset of tumour cells but non-apoptotic cell death in other subsets
of tumour cells [157] (Table 1).

Overall, GEMMs provide valuable insights into the molecular
mechanisms driving cancer formation and development. Studies
using the p53 restorable mouse models suggest that reactivation
of WT p53 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating
mutant p53-driven lung cancers. The use of GEMMs facilitates our
understanding of lung cancer biology, as well as the development
of new therapeutic interventions.

THE PROGNOSTIC ROLE OF P53 MUTATIONS
While p53 mutations are found in over half of NSCLC [158, 159] and
over 75% of SCLC [133, 134], the impact of p53 mutations on
prognosis remains controversial and can vary between lung cancer
subtypes and tumour stage. Several studies have shown that LUAD
patients with p53 mutations have worse OS compared to patients
with WT p53 lung cancers, whereas no signiﬁcant differences were
observed in LUSC patients [160–162]. Other studies focusing on
tumour stage have reported that mutations in p53 are associated with
worse OS in stage I NSCLC patients but not in stage II and stage III
patients [110, 112]. Of note, the differences in therapeutic histories of
patients and the small number of patients included in some of these
studies could be confounding factors that led to contradictory results.
In SCLC, it was found that p53 mutations provided tumour cells with a
growth advantage in metastatic disease and growth in tissue
cultivation [134, 163]. Consistent with this ﬁnding, other studies have
reported that the proportion of tumours with mutant p53 is higher
than those with WT p53 in late-stage SCLC patients
[164].
Furthermore, histological staining of mutant p53 proteins in over
100 SCLC tumour specimens revealed that the presence of mutant
p53 is associated with poor patient survival, supporting the role of
mutant p53 as a predictive marker of poor prognosis in SCLC [165].
While most studies only distinguished between cancer patients
with WT p53 versus mutant p53, the diverse spectrum of p53
mutations was found to correlate with the heterogeneous clinical
outcomes. Poeta et al. proposed to categorise p53 mutations
according to their effects on protein function. They classiﬁed p53
mutations into two groups: disruptive mutations which can lead to
the LOF of the mutant p53 proteins, and non-disruptive mutations
which partially retain some functions of WT p53 and are reportedly
often associated with DNE and alleged GOF effects of mutant p53
[166]. Studies following these criteria have shown that non-disruptive
p53 mutations are associated with signiﬁcantly shorter OS in
advanced NSCLC patients, whereas p53 mutations, as a whole,
showed no signiﬁcant correlation with OS. This may be explained by
the possible DNE and GOF effects of non-disruptive mutant p53
proteins that lead to increased proliferation, metastasis and chemo-
resistance, whereas disruptive p53 mutations are unlikely to exert DNE
and GOF effects [167]. Different impacts of mutant p53 on patient
outcome were also observed in other cancers, including head and
neck cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and breast cancer
[166, 168, 169]. However, some recent studies provided evidence that
for the sustained expansion of cancers, alleged GOF effects of mutant
p53 proteins are not critical [170–172].

IMMUNE AND METABOLIC MICROENVIRONMENTS IN P53
MUTANT TUMOURS
It is widely accepted that tumour progression is not only impacted
by cell autonomous features but also by the TME. Mutant p53

proteins have been found to promote a pro-oncogenic TME by
modulating the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by the
tumour cells [173]. In addition, p53 also plays an important role in
anti-tumour
innate and
immunity through the regulation of
adaptive immune proﬁles [174] and/or the expression of immune-
inhibitory checkpoint regulators by the cancer cells [175].

CD4+ helper T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and in
certain cases, neutrophils contribute to immune surveillance of
tumour cells [176–179], whereas other immune cells, such as
regulatory T cells and certain myeloid cell subsets, were reported
to suppress anti-tumour immune responses [180–182]. Tumour-
associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major component of the
TME. Two main polarisations of TAMs include M1-like macro-
phages, which exhibit anti-tumour activities by stimulating the
adaptive immune response and inﬂammation and, conversely,
M2-like macrophages, which exhibit tumour promoting activities
by suppressing the immune response in the TME [183]. In lung
cancer, TAMs are the most abundant immune cells present in the
TME [184], and they were reported to promote the proliferation,
epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis of cancer cells,
which results in poor patient outcomes [185, 186]. A signiﬁcant
increase in TAMs was observed in NSCLC and other cancers in
response to loss of p53 [187]. NSCLC cells were found to facilitate
the polarisation of TAMs towards the M2 phenotype in vitro [185].
However, other studies showed an increase in M1-like macro-
phages in p53 mutant LUAD and LUSC patients [188, 189].
Furthermore, mutant p53 expressed in cancer cells has been
reported to impact macrophage behaviour through its GOF effects
thereby supporting tumour development [190]. T cell-mediated
killing of tumour cells is critical for anti-tumour immunity. The
activity of T cells during an immune response is regulated by the
expression of immune checkpoint regulators, such as PD-1 [191].
Tumour cells exploit this pathway by upregulating the expression
of ligands of these regulators, such as PD-L1, to dampen the
immune response. The loss of p53 in malignant cells is correlated
with increased expression of PD-L1 in cells of the TME in many
cancers,
It has been
reported that p53 mutant lung cancer patients exhibited increased
expression of immune checkpoint regulators, enhanced CD8 T cell
inﬁltration and increased expression of effector T cell and
interferon-γ associated genes [194]. This may indicate the
predictive value of mutant p53 for responses to ICB in lung
cancer. Of note, there are also studies showing that in murine lung
cancer models, p53-deﬁcient tumour cells downregulated antigen
presentation by reducing the expression of MHC-I, consequently
exhibiting poorer
to ICB compared to WT p53
expressing tumours [195]. Concordant observations were found
in human lung cancer, where NSCLC patients with p53 truncating
mutations had shorter OS with immunotherapy compared to
patients with WT p53 expressing tumours [196]. Further research is
required to better understand the clinical predictive value of the
different p53 mutations in lung cancer.

including lung cancer

[174, 192, 193].

responses

Metabolic reprogramming in the TME can result in signiﬁcant
changes in the function and response of the immune system.
Recently, it was reported that glucose metabolism is associated with
the phenotype of certain immune cells, such as macrophages,
dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells [197–199]. In a study of 495 LUAD
patients, genes involved in the glycolysis–gluconeogenesis metabolic
pathways were shown to be correlated with p53 mutations [188]. As a
result of accelerated glycolysis in tumour cells, high levels of lactate
are generated. The accumulation of lactate in the TME not only
facilitates the progression and metastatic spread of tumour cells, but
also exerts immune modulatory effects on tumour inﬁltrating immune
cells.
It was found that lactate suppresses the proliferation and
cytokine production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and thereby impairs
their anti-tumour activity [200]. Furthermore, tumour cell derived
lactate was shown to inhibit the differentiation and activation of
dendritic cells and the secretion of TNF by monocytes [201, 202]. High

[203, 204]. Taken together, understanding the contributions of
immune and metabolic parameters to tumour development is crucial
for improving the predictive value and therapeutic strategies for p53
mutant lung cancers.

TARGETING P53 FOR THE TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER
Many anti-cancer therapeutics kill cancer cells by inducing DNA
damage which triggers WT p53-mediated apoptosis and/or cell
cycle arrest/cell senescence. Accordingly, loss or mutation of p53
can contribute to the resistance of diverse tumour cells to
cytotoxic drugs [6]. It has been reported that mutant p53 protein
can negatively impact the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin treatment
for NSCLC via the upregulation of NRF2, a transcription factor that
was reported to contribute to the resistance of malignant cells to
several anti-cancer drugs [205]. Furthermore, patients with WT p53
expressing lung cancers were observed to exhibit better

responses to cisplatin-based therapies compared to patients with
mutant p53 expressing lung cancers [206, 207]. Due to the high
mutation rate of malignant cells with defects in the p53 pathway
and the fact that mutant p53 proteins are only highly expressed in
malignant tissues but absent in normal tissues, targeting mutant
p53 itself has been proposed to be a promising strategy for
improving the treatment of chemo- and/or
radio-resistant
tumours.

Considerable efforts have been expended to explore strategies
to therapeutically target mutant p53 in cancer cells. These
strategies include promoting the degradation of mutant p53
proteins through proteasomal or autophagy pathways (Fig. 4A),
restoring WT p53 function in mutant p53 proteins in cancer cells
(Fig. 4B),
inhibiting the interactions between mutant p53 and
proteins that allegedly exert their GOF activities (Fig. 4C) as well as
inhibiting downstream signalling pathways that may be activated
by mutant p53 [208] (Fig. 4D). However, as stated above, recent
studies have provided compelling evidence that
removal of
mutant p53 proteins had no impact on tumour expansion,

metastasis and response to anti-cancer agents [170–172]. This
demonstrates that any strategies aimed at removing or modulat-
ing mutant p53 proteins are unlikely to have therapeutic impact.
Many compounds have been developed to convert the mutant
p53 protein into a WT p53 conformation, thereby restoring some
WT p53 functions. For instance, PhiKan083 and PK7088 speciﬁcally
target the mutant p53Y220C protein by stabilising its structure,
thereby increasing the levels of p53Y220C proteins with WT
conformation and activity [209, 210]. Other compounds targeting
various mutant p53 proteins include PRIMA-1 and its methylated
derivative APR-246, SCH29074 and CP-31398, which are thought
to be able to restore WT TP53 function by promoting the proper
folding of the mutant p53 protein [211–213]. Among all these
compounds, APR-246 has been shown to effectively induce
apoptosis in SCLC cell lines [214]. Furthermore, synergistic effects
of APR-246 with cisplatin treatment were observed in both NSCLC
and SCLC cell lines [215, 216], indicating its therapeutic potential
in clinical settings. Importantly, although individual mutations and
their associated GOF effects can result in variable therapeutic
vulnerabilities, the restoration of WT p53 function exerts compar-
able effects across tumours with different mutant p53 in lung
cancer mouse models that can be switched from mutant p53 to
WT p53 [217]. However, of note, recent studies have revealed that
APR-246 does not actually kill malignant cells by targeting mutant
p53 since CRISPR mediated removal of mutant p53 had no impact
on sensitivity to this agent in a broad range of cancer cell lines
[218].

The restoration of WT p53 function has the potential to improve
the treatment outcome of
lung cancer patients to standard
therapy by enhancing the response of tumour cells to DNA
damage-inducing agents [217]. However, studies using mouse
models suggest
targeting mutant p53 might only be
beneﬁcial to patients with late-stage lung cancer, as mutant p53
proteins are only adequately activated in advanced tumours
[154, 156]. Regardless, these ﬁndings provide valuable insights in
the therapeutic impact of restoration of WT p53 function in lung
cancer.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
tumour suppressor that protects cells from
p53 is a crucial
malignant
transformation by activating a range of cellular
responses, including apoptosis, adaptation of cellular metabolism,
cell cycle arrest, cell senescence and DNA damage repair. p53 is
the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and its
mutations are associated with poor patient outcomes, although
there is some controversy in lung cancer. Despite decades of
research, the exact mechanisms by which mutant p53 proteins
promote the initiation and sustained expansion of cancer remains
a topic of extensive debate. Furthermore, the interplay between
mutant p53 and other oncogenic drivers and the impact of co-
mutations on the development and therapeutic responses of lung
cancer are unclear. The development of GEMMs has allowed for
insights into the biology of p53 mutant cancers, as they reliably
mimic the oncogenic mutations underpinning cancer formation in
humans and hence enable the study of the impact of speciﬁc
oncogenic driver events.

Although immunotherapy has achieved remarkable break-
through in lung cancer treatment, patients with mutant p53
expressing lung cancers only show limited responses
to
immunotherapies. This highlights the urgent need for novel
therapeutic approaches to enhance the efﬁcacy of
immu-
notherapies. p53 mutations often confer resistance to many
anti-cancer agents that induce DNA damage. Therefore, explor-
ing strategies that speciﬁcally target mutant p53 are of great
importance for improving the clinical outcomes for these cancer
patients. Moreover, p53 mutant lung cancers exhibit high levels
to
of molecular and clinical heterogeneity, which leads

heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Therefore, characterisation
of the impacts of different p53 mutant proteins is essential for
improving the prognostic and predictive values of mutant p53
for treatment response, as well as for the development of
personalised treatments for patients with p53 mutant lung
cancers. Overall, p53 mutations remain an ongoing challenge in
understanding the development of cancer as well as cancer
therapy. Further research is required to address these pressing
issues and advance our understanding of the many functions of
WT p53 in tumour suppression and the impact of the different
p53 mutant proteins in lung cancer.
