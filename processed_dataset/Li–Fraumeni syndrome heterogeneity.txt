Abstract
Clinical variability is commonly seen in Li–Fraumeni syndrome. Phenotypic heterogeneity is present among different families 
affected by the same pathogenic variant in TP53 gene and among members of the same family. However, causes of this huge 
clinical spectrum have not been studied in depth. TP53 type mutation, polymorphic variants in TP53 gene or in TP53-related 
genes, copy number variations in particular regions, and/or epigenetic deregulation of TP53 expression might be responsible 
for clinical heterogeneity. In this review, recent advances in the understanding of genetic and epigenetic aspects influencing 
Li–Fraumeni phenotype are discussed.

Li–Fraumeni syndrome

Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare predisposing can-
cer disease transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. 
The variable clinical expressions of this syndrome are an 
extreme challenge for individualized surveillance [1]. This 
particular syndrome was described for the first time by Li 
and Fraumeni in 1969 [2]. Li–Fraumeni disorder predisposes 
to malignant tumors development. These tumors can appear 
throughout the life of the patient. Cancer types observed in 
LFS patients include: soft tissue sarcomas [3, 4], osteosar-
coma [5, 6], breast cancer [7, 8], brain tumors, leukemia [9, 
10] and adrenocortical carcinoma [11] (#151623 OMIM).

However, aggressiveness and the number of tumors vary to 
a great extending among different patients.

Cumulative incidence for development of at least one 
tumor at 30 years old is estimated to be 50%, while it is near 
100% at 70 years old [12]. Cancer risk at early ages is higher 
in women due to breast cancer risk. Cumulative incidence in 
women at 70 years old is 54% for breast cancer, 15% for soft 
tissue sarcomas, 6% for brain tumors, and 5% for osteosar-
coma. For male patients, however, the reported figures are 
22%, 19%, and 11% for soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, 
and osteosarcoma, respectively. Fifty percent of patients 
with a malignant tumor developed a second tumor over the 
next 10 years [12]. Several patients with many malignant 
primary tumors have been described in the literature [13].

Approximately  70%  of  families  affected  by  classical 
tumors carry germinal mutations in TP53. However, 40% 
of patients with Li–Fraumeni-like (LFL) phenotype (fami-
lies with other malignant tumors, different from classical 
tumors) carry TP53 deleterious mutations. TP53 mutations, 
associated to LFS or LFL, are mainly located in the DNA-
binding domain. Only few cases harbor TP53 mutations out-
side this hotspot location [14, 15].

Pathogenic TP53 variants do not explain all phenotypic 
manifestations. Mutations within the cell cycle checkpoint 
gene CHEK2 have also been reported in some LFS or LFL 
families without detectable TP53 mutations [16–20]. How-
ever, there are still relatively few reports of such mutations. 
Despite the fact that CHEK2 is no longer considered as a 
major determinant of LFS, a number of studies support the 
hypothesis that CHEK2 gene may act as a factor contributing

to  individual  tumor  development  in  families  with  LFL 
tumors. In addition to CHEK2, mutations in POT1 (protec-
tion of telomeres 1) have also been associated with the risk 
of developing several tumor types and have been detected 
in LFL families [21, 22]. POT1 encodes a nuclear protein 
that is essential for telomere maintenance. A higher telom-
eric fragility has been demonstrated in patients affected by 
pathogenic POT1 variants [16].

There are still a significant number of LFS/LFL families 
for whom no underlying genetic determinant has been identi-
fied. For this reason, many authors have studied the influence 
of BAX [23], CDKN1A/p21 (cell cycle arrest mediator) [24], 
PTEN (associated to PTEN hamartoma syndrome) [25], 
PRDM and GAS8 [26] in LFS families without detectable 
TP53 mutations. However, none of them has been identified 
as determinant of LFS.

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technol-
ogies, have allowed the identification of TP53 pathogenic 
variants in patients with malignant tumors and without clini-
cal suspicion of LFS. Therefore, tumor development predis-
position in those cases seems to be related to these particular 
variants [27–29]. Consequently, new bioinformatics tools 
(not clinical data alone) have been suggested to detect suit-
able patients for genetic studies [30].

So far, LFS and LFL cases have been commonly classi-
fied based on clinical descriptions. New strategies, focused 
not only on clinical data, but also on molecular alterations, 
would be more suitable for LFS and LFL classification. 
Following this idea, nomenclature should also be adapted, 
and therefore, “TP53 Cancer Predisposition Syndrome” and 
“CHEK2 Cancer Predisposition Syndrome” could be new 
nomenclatures. All patients with one or more malignant 
tumors that are clearly related to either of the pathogenic 
variants (TP53 or CHEK2), might be affected by one of 
these two proposed entities (“TP53 Cancer Predisposition 
Syndrome” or “CHEK2 Cancer Predisposition Syndrome”), 
respectively. Sub-classifications could be also possible, but 
the molecular basis (germline TP53 or CHEK2 pathogenic 
variant) should be the start point to correctly classifying 
patients in syndromic entities (based on present knowledge). 
Li–Fraumeni syndrome might be an exclusion diagnosis, 
when TP53 or CHEK2 alterations were not founded and the 
family or personal story suggests the LF or LFL syndrome.

Li–Fraumeni syndrome dependent 
on pathogenic variants in TP53

Tumors more frequently associated to TP53 germline muta-
tions are: soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma, breast can-
cer, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinoma. 
However, many other different tumor types have also been 
described: phyllodes tumor, choroid plexus tumors, and 

melanoma.  Additionally,  more  infrequent  tumor  types 
included: lung, digestive tract, thyroid tumors, ovary, colon, 
lymphoma, and childhood malignant meningioma [31–44].
Up to now, causes of phenotypic differences among fami-
lies affected by different predisposing mutations to LFS are 
poorly understood. Furthermore, the potential causes of phe-
notypic differences among members of the same family are 
not known. Factors influencing those phenotypic differences 
will be reviewed below.

TP53 gene

TP53 encodes a tumor suppressor protein which in response 
to oncogenic mutations or DNA damage triggers a transcrip-
tional program to regulate DNA repair mechanisms, cell 
cycle progression and apoptosis [45, 46]. TP53 is essential 
for regulating cell division and preventing tumor formation 
[47–50]. It also plays a key role in aging [51, 52], cellular 
metabolism [53,  54], regulation of homeostasis [55] and 
immune function [46, 56, 57].

Tetramer formation of p53 is essential for its tumor sup-
pressor function. This oligomerization is modulated by the 
protein concentration of p53, post-translational modifica-
tions, and/or interactions with its binding proteins [58]. 
The active protein conformation induces cell cycle arrest, 
senescence, and apoptosis through transcriptional regulation 
of some target genes or non-transcriptional pathways [59]. 
It is accepted that p53-dependent transcriptional activation 
occurs by binding to a consensus DNA sequence called the 
p53 response element in target genes promoters. Fischer M 
et al. meta-analysis concluded that p53 is not a direct repres-
sor of transcription, but solely activates its target genes [60]. 
Therefore, p53 acts mainly as conductor conditioning the 
transcription of several genes: p21, MDM2, GADD45, BAX, 
XPC, XPE and 14-3-3σ [61]. This well-scored transcrip-
tional program performs many of the described TP53/p53 
tumor suppressor functions.

Somatic mutations in this central gene are frequently 
observed  in  human  cancers  [62–64]  and  the  knowledge 
about TP53/p53 in tumors has been useful to understand 
the phenotypic differences in patients with Li–Fraumeni 
syndrome.

Mutated TP53 gene

TP53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, and 
disrupted  in  practically  the  rest  of  them  [65].  Approxi-
mately 80% of TP53 mutations are single point mutations 
(the majority of TP53 well accepted alterations are mis-
sense mutations). Moreover, the gene has hotspot mutations 
[66], in fact, its central domain (nucleotides 102-292) alone 
accounts for 90% of the changes [66]. Tumor suppressor 
gene inactivation does not follow the Knudson model for 

1 3980 

Clinical and Translational Oncology (2020) 22:978–988

TP53 (this model implies the inactivation sequence of the 
two alleles). The p53 protein is especially inactivated by 
“dominance negative” effect of pathogenic missense vari-
ants. The mutated p53 monomers bind and inactivate wild-
type p53 monomers. Beside the loss of function (common 
to all pathogenic TP53 variants) and the dominant-negative 
effect on the wild-type p53 activity of pathogenic missense 
variants, the mutant p53 could also acquire new oncogenic 
functions, the so-called “gain-of-functions”. [67]. There-
fore, some missense TP53 mutations (R282, R175, Y220, 
R248 and R273) might not only alter the protein function 
by disrupting the DNA-binding capacity [31], but also can 
favor a greater oncogenic activity [68]. As a consequence, 
and speaking about Li–Fraumeni patients, a more aggressive 
phenotype associated to some pathogenic missense variants 
(gain-of-function variants) has been observed in large patient 
cohorts [69, 70]. In this regard, Amadou et al. in a review of 
1730 patients found an earlier age of tumor onset in patients 
with missense mutations (21.3 years), compared to those 
with all types of loss of function mutations (28.5 years) or 
genomic rearrangements (35.8 years). Notably, most of chil-
dren with LFS in this study carried missense mutations [71].
Tumors with missense TP53 mutations occur earlier in 
life and are frequently associated to specific histological 
subtypes [72]. Ognjanovic et al. described that globally, 
pathogenic missense mutations in exons encoding the DNA-
binding domain, were more frequently observed in patients 
with rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma while loss of 
function  mutations  were  more  frequent  in  patients  with 
leiomyosarcoma [72]. In addition, not only the type of vari-
ant, but also, the location of the variant may cause certain 
types of tumors to be more frequent than others [73]. Olivier 
et al. described that brain tumors were associated with mis-
sense TP53 mutations located in the DNA-binding loop that 
contact the minor groove of DNA, whereas adrenal gland 
carcinomas were associated with missense mutations located 
in the loops opposing the protein–DNA contact surface [73]. 
The greatest compilation of information regarding the geno-
type–phenotype relationship is found in the IARC (Inter-
national Agency for Research on Cancer) TP53 Database.

The type and location of TP53 variants may condition a 
different biological activity of the protein, and facilitate the 
development of certain tumor types. However, despite hav-
ing the same genetic alteration in TP53, there are significant 
differences among families, which cannot be explained by 
the type of mutation.

Polymorphic variants of TP53

The  presence  of  certain  polymorphisms  within  TP53 
sequence may determine LFS clinical presentation since 
these polymorphisms may modify the oncogenic activity of 
the p53 protein. A novel p.Gly360Val TP53 variant (in a 

linker region near the tetramerization domain) is known to 
be responsible for a phenomenon called enhanced transacti-
vation: transcriptional activation of TP53 target genes condi-
tions the up-regulation of several p53 response elements and, 
as a result, the final function of p53 in the cell is modified 
[74]. The effects of this variant in cancer phenotype among 
families and members of the same family remain unknown. 
Otherwise, it was postulated that TP53 PIN3 polymorphic 
variant (hg19 chr17: 7579690; a 16 bp duplication in intron 
3) may contribute to the phenotypic diversity of germline 
TP53 mutations associated with LFS/LFL patients. [75]. 
Indeed, Marcel et al. reported that the heterozygous TP53 
PIN3 variant supposed a difference of 19.0 years in the mean 
age at the first diagnosis in TP53 mutation carriers. The pol-
ymorphic variant delayed the appearance of the first tumor 
[75]. Sagne et al. also observed that cancer tended to occur 
approximately 15 years later in mutation carriers who also 
carried the polymorphic variant TP53 PIN3 [76]. Another 
example is the p.Pro72Arg allele of TP53; Bougeard et al. 
described that the mean age of tumor onset in Arg allele car-
riers (21.8 years) was significantly different from the mean 
age of tumor onset from those with Pro/Pro (34.4 years) 
[77]. Marcel et al. reported anticipation of 8.3 years when 
Arg allele was present [75] (Fig. 1). These polymorphic vari-
ants could explain the diversity of tumor patterns among 
members of the same family.

Polymorphic variants in MDM2 gene

Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) plays an important role 
in TP53 regulation. MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin-pro-
tein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of p53/TP53, lead-
ing to its degradation by the proteasome. This gene is itself 
transcriptionally regulated by p53. Therefore, the encoded 
protein can promote tumor formation by targeting p53, if it 
does not function well. In fact, overexpression or amplifica-
tion of this locus is detected in a variety of different can-
cers (Fig. 2). It has been proposed that certain polymorphic 
variants of MDM2 can condition its function and, therefore, 
could explain clinical differences among families or mem-
bers of the same family with LFS. The most outstanding 
example is MDM2 SNP309 (hg19 chr12: 69202580; T– > G 
variation), which has been described as a modifier of tumor 
phenotype.  This  particular  polymorphism  increases  the 
expression of MDM2 and, as a consequence an attenuation 
of the p53 pathway is detected [77–80]. Bougeard et al. 
reported an accelerated phenotype among MDM2 SNP309 
G allele carriers. The mean age of tumor onset in MDM2 
SNP309 G allele carriers (19.6 years) was significantly dif-
ferent from that observed in patients homozygous for the 
T allele (29.9 years, p < 0.05). Their data also supported 
an amplified effect on the age of tumor onset by the TP53 
p. Pro72Arg allele [77]. Ruijs et al. published that among

the  TP53  germline  mutation  carriers,  a  significant  dif-
ference was seen in the mean age of tumor onset for the 
SNP309 G allele group, that is, 29.7 years as compared to 
the SNP309 homozygous T group 45.5 years (P = 0.005) 
[78]. In the same way, Macedo et al. studied the median 
age at first diagnosis among Li–Fraumeni patients carrying 
TP53 R337H mutation. The median age at first diagnosis 
was earlier in MDM2 SNP309 GG carriers when compared 
to other genotypes for both tumors analyzed in their study 
(adrenocortical carcinoma and breast cancer); however, they 
did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference [79]. 
Renaux-Petel et al. published results concordant with these, 
and also reported other interesting data about MDM2 285G 
and 309G polymorphism interactions. They reported that the 
MDM2 285-309 G–G is a higher risk haplotype in patients 
with germline TP53 mutations and, therefore, suggesting 
that the MDM2 309G variation is deleterious when its effect 
is not neutralized by the 285C variation [80].

Unfortunately, not enough information is available in con-
crete populations to translate to Li–Fraumeni patients poly-
morphic data with prognosis implications. Nowadays, physi-
cians could not personalize surveillance programs based on 
polymorphic data. Nevertheless, we consider mandatory to 
study TP53 PIN3, TP53 p. Pro72Arg and MDM2 SNP309 
for all Li–Fraumeni patients. The study of at least these three 
TP53 polymorphisms (mainly MDM2) is the only way to 

assess their impact on individual and familial diversity of 
tumor patterns. To do so, national and international con-
tributions integrating all this information joined to TP53 
mutation type and clinical data is the way to follow.

microRNA regulation pattern

It is known that certain microRNAs are members of TP53 
transcriptional program. It has been proposed that miR-605 
(regulator of loop p53-MDM2) could affect the tumor phe-
notype in LFS [81]. When cellular stress is present, p53 
escapes the p53:Mdm2 negative feedback to accumulate rap-
idly and to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Xiao et al. 
demonstrated that miR-605 is transcriptionally activated by 
p53 and post-transcriptionally represses Mdm2. The activa-
tion of p53 upregulates miR-605 expression, via interacting 
with the promoter region of the gene [81]. Based on the 
knowledge about p53-miR-605-MDM2 interactions, poly-
morphic variants in miR-605 gene and their role in Li–Frau-
meni phenotype were studied. Indeed, the variant G allele 
of miR-605 (Hg 19 chr10: 53059406) was proposed by Id 
Said B and Malkin D as modifier of the LFS phenotype. 
They described a 10-year acceleration in the mean age of 
LFS tumor onset when miR-605 (Hg 19 chr10: 53059406) 
is present, supporting their hypothesis [82].

Fig. 2   DNA damage drives p53 activation. Protein p53 develops tran-
scription factor functions that condition cell cycle stop and apoptosis 
activation  and  also  stimulates  MDM2  transcription.  Murine  double 

minute 2 (MDM2 protein) plays an important role in p53/TP53 regu-
lation.  MDM2  encodes  an  E3  ubiquitin-protein  ligase  that  mediates 
ubiquitination of p53, leading to its degradation by the proteasome

Moreover, miR-34A is a key component of the p53 regu-
latory network. It was shown that p53 regulates the expres-
sion of miR-34A, representing an important mechanism of 
p53 signaling. Members of the miR-34 family were pro-
posed as the most prevalent p53-induced miRNAs and are 
frequently silenced in variety of tumor entities, suggesting 
that they are important tumor suppressors [83]. Accordingly, 
miR-34A is inactivated by hypermethylation across many 
histologic types of primary tumors from patients with LFS. 
Malkin D group, described that loss of function TP53 muta-
tions were significantly associated with hypermethylation at 
the locus encoding miR-34A (P < 0.001) in germline, and 
this observation was validated in an independent patient 
cohort (P < 0.001) [84]. At tumoral level, miR-34A hyper-
methylation was associated with decreased overall survival 
in a cohort of 29 patients with choroid plexus carcinomas 
(P < 0.05) [84].

In conclusion, the systematic study of polymorphic vari-
ants in TP53 and MDM2 genes could enrich Li–Fraumeni 

knowledge,  as  commented  above.  In  the  same  way,  the 
polymorphism miR-605 (Hg 19 chr10: 53059406 G allele) 
and the methylation pattern at the locus encoding miR-34A 
should be mandatory when a Li–Fraumeni patient carrying 
a TP53 mutation is diagnosed. We will be able to enhance 
our comprehension of this entity sharing this information 
internationally.

Copy number variations

Copy  number  variations  (CNV)  among  Li–Fraumeni 
patients carrying TP53 mutations are understudied. TP53 
dysfunction causes an increased number of copy number 
variations due to tumor instability [85–87]. Shlien et al. 
published  that  LFS  TP53  mutation  carriers  present  an 
increased CNV both in tumors and germline [88]. They stud-
ied a cohort of 53 individuals from Li–Fraumeni families, 
33 were TP53 mutation carriers and 20 harbored wild-type 
TP53 (controls). Controls displayed a median of 2 CNVs per 

1 3Clinical and Translational Oncology (2020) 22:978–988 

983

genome in germline. However, the TP53 mutation carriers 
displayed a significant increase in CNVs (a mean of 12.19 
CNVs) (p = 0.01). They also suggested a dose–response rela-
tionship between CNV frequency and severity of the LFS 
phenotype. Interestingly, they showed even greater number 
of CNVs among those TP53 carriers affected by cancer, 
than those which have not developed cancer yet. Moreo-
ver, they found two genes involved in recurrent duplications 
among LFS families: MLLT4 and ADAM12. They proposed 
that CNV frequency, or another high-resolution measure 
of instability, may help to define the nature and severity of 
the germline TP53 mutations found in LFS families [88]. 
This hypothesis was tested by Ariffin et al. in a family with 
clinical data of anticipation. They analyzed CNV exceed-
ing 10 kb in size. They concluded that CNV composition 
did not show significant variation among family members, 
despite their differences in TP53 mutation carriage and in 
cancer status [89]. Furthermore, Silva et al. did not find any 
difference in the total number of germline CNV present in 
LFS patients versus controls. However, they noted a highly 
significant increase (> fivefold) in the rare CNVs (estimated 
based both on DGV and db Var) in TP53 DNA-binding 
domain mutation carriers as compared both to controls and 
to p.R337H carriers. They proposed that different microarray 
technologies used by Shlien et al. could be the origin of their 
hopeful results [90].

Total number of germline CNVs cannot be used to stratify 
risk assessment for Li–Fraumeni patients based on present 
knowledge. Nevertheless, deletions or duplications in con-
crete genome regions could explain some phenotypic dif-
ferences among families or members of the same family. 
Larger cohort and homogeneous populations of Li–Frau-
meni patients sharing TP53 mutation should be studied in 
this way to obtain conclusive results.

Telomeric length variations

The influence of telomere length in final phenotypic dif-
ferences has been studied among the carriers of germline 
mutations in TP53. Human telomeres are nucleoprotein 
complexes at chromosome ends, consisting of TTA GGG  
repeats and associated telomere-binding proteins. In germ 
cells, telomeres range from 10 to 15 kb in length. Telom-
eres protect chromosomes from nuclease degradation and 
chromosome rearrangements and serve as mitotic clocks 
that monitor the number of cell divisions. A possible link 
between p53, telomeres, tumor initiation, and anticipation in 
LFS, has been suggested [91–93]. Based on this hypothesis, 
Trkova et al. published that the telomere length in periph-
eral blood cells was shorter among TP53 mutation carriers 
than in general population. They did not find progressive 
telomere shortening among Li–Fraumeni generations. How-
ever, they observed a trend (not statistically significant) of 

earlier onset of cancer in individuals with shorter telom-
eres and vice versa [94]. Tabori et al. published that tel-
omere length was significantly shorter in affected than in 
non-affected TP53 mutation carriers. They concluded that 
telomere length could explain earlier age of onset of tumors 
in successive generations of the same family with identical 
TP53/MDM2-SNP309 genotypes [95]. Not enough informa-
tion is available in this way to reach to conclusions and to 
take clinical decisions. More in-depth studies are needed.

Oxidative stress cell level

So far, there is just one published study in the literature that 
compares levels of oxidative stress between TP53 carriers 
and controls. Macedo et al. reported an increase in cellular 
oxidative stress among patients with the p53R TP53 variant 
(p.Arg337His). Specifically, an increase in erythrocyte GPx 
activity and carbonyl levels in plasma (indicator of protein 
oxidative damage) in mutation carriers compared to non-
carriers. In addition, a significant increase in malondialde-
hyde levels (indicative of increased lipid peroxidation) has 
been demonstrated in TP53 p.Arg337His mutation carriers. 
Thus, the cellular oxidative damage level could also par-
tially explain the different phenotype among LFS families 
and members of the same LFS family. To the best of our 
knowledge, this phenomenon has not been studied in large 
patient cohorts [96].

Epigenetic regulation of TP53 expression

The TP53 promoter is highly regulated. Different mecha-
nisms participate in a delicate control. A direct binding 
of several transcription factors in TP53 promoter is well 
described. Saldaña-Meyer et al. reviewed the TP53 epige-
netic regulation extensively [97]. TP53 human promoter has 
several conserved transcription factor binding motifs.

Different transcription factors bind TP53 promoter and 
upregulate its expression. They are Myc/Max, USF, AP-1, 
ETS2, NFκB, RREB-1, ETS2, YY, NF, HOXA5, p53/p73, 
pituitary homeobox 1 (hPitx1) and ISGF3 (formed by Stat1, 
Stat2 and IRF-9). Moreover, kinase C δ (PKCδ) although 
does not bind the TP53 promoter, promotes TP53 transac-
tivation. Nevertheless, Pax and BCL6 transcription factors 
inhibit the TP53 promoter. ETS1 also binds on the human 
TP53 promoter, but its effects are not well described [97]. 
A particular transcription factor is E2F1 which binds TP53 
promoter and has a direct role in the induction of mutant 
p53 [97].

Furthermore, TP53 human promoter has a CTCF binding 
site downstream of a CpG island. CTCF influences tran-
scriptional regulation of TP53. In fact, when knocking-down 
CTCF, the human TP53 gene loses its expression supporting

its relevant contribution to TP53 expression regulation [97, 
98].

Otherwise, the TP53 gene promoter regulation by DNA 
methylation remains controversial. Present knowledge points 
to the lack of methylation over the TP53 core promoter. 
Therefore, other mechanisms might be involved (methyla-
tion of genomic regions different from promoters) [97].

Finally, microRNAs can negatively regulate TP53 gene 
expression and if deregulated can promote cancer. The best 
known examples are: miRNA-125a and miRNA-125b which 
represses p53 post-transcriptionally. MicroRNA-504, micro-
RNA-25, miRNA-30d and LincRNA-p21 interfere as well 
with p53 functions [97]. The anti-sense RNA Wrap53 is 
necessary for the proper transcription of TP53 [97].

TP53 is regulated by multiple transcription factors and 
microRNAs, which are epigenetically regulated. Thus, a 
certain pattern of epigenetic regulation of all these regu-
latory genes could condition a wild-type and mutated p53 
cellular level, variable from one individual to another, which 
might explain phenotypic differences among members of the 
same Li–Fraumeni family. No studies were developed either 
studying plasma levels of these regulatory elements or meth-
ylation pattern of their codifying genes among Li–Fraumeni 
patients. It could be a way to explore in the future.

Epigenetic regulation of genes regulated by TP53

Genetic and epigenetic alterations may be involved in the 
phenotypic variability of LFS. p53 regulates several path-
ways,  including  the  thymine  DNA  glycosylase  (TDG) 
pathway, which regulates the DNA methylation of several 
genes. Fortes et al. compared the DNA methylation pat-
tern of genes related to the TDG pathway among germline 

TP53 mutations carriers, patients with wild-type TP53, and 
healthy individuals. Finally, no significant differences were 
found. However, increased TDG expression was detected in 
patients with p.R337H TP53 mutation affected by adreno-
cortical carcinoma. Further studies in larger patient cohorts 
are necessary to evaluate the clinical impact of epigenetic 
alterations on genes potentially involved in LFS variability 
[99].

Other elements to consider

The presence of mutations in certain RecQ DNA helicases 
(like BLM (Bloom syndrome (BS) protein) and WRN (Wer-
ner syndrome protein)) would affect TP53 function. The 
Harris CC group suggests that p53 mediates the coopera-
tion of p53 and BLM to induce apoptosis. Therefore, certain 
variants in these genes might affect, at least partially, the 
function of TP53 [100].

The elements that might condition the tumor phenotype 

in LFS are detailed in Table 1.

Environmental components

Phenotypic differences are detected among Li–Fraumeni 
patients  from  different  geographical  origins.  Environ-
ment could affect tumor development among TP53 carri-
ers, therefore, life style, diet and environmental exposures 
joined to all above said, probably condition the final phe-
notype. An environmental component may be responsible 
for the differences observed among families from different 
origins that share TP53 mutation [89]. None large cohort 
studying  its  influence  has  been  published.  Moreover,

founding mutations are very common in certain regions 
and exceptional in others, and this makes comparative 
studies difficult.

Anticipation?

A  decrease  in  the  age  at  cancer  onset  and  an  increase 
in more LFS-specific cancers in successive generations 
have been suggested [101, 102]. The genetic mechanisms 
proposed to explain this heterogeneity include accumula-
tion of copy number variations (CNVs) with successive 
generations, and progressive telomere shortening [88]. 
Ariffin et al. studied a dataset of 269 pedigrees of TP53 
germline  mutation  carriers.  Although,  they  reported  a 
decrease in age at first cancer onset in multigeneration 
pedigrees, their observations did not fit with a classical 
model of anticipation. Nevertheless, only pedigrees with 
three or four generations showed a delayed age at first 
cancer onset in the older generations of TP53 mutation 
carriers. Then, they suggested that the founder patient of 
such pedigrees may carry, in addition to germline TP53 
mutation, rare independent genetic modifiers that attenu-
ate the risk of early cancer. These genetic variants might 
allow cancer-free survival until postreproduction age of 
founders. Based on these observations, they proposed the 
term “genetic regression” instead of anticipation [103]. 
To understand this phenomenon, they looked for CNVs 
larger  than  10  kb  and  for  telomere  length  shortening 
among kindred affected by LFS-specific cancer, but did 
not discover significant differences. Moreover, they did not 
find neither more frequent MDM2-SNP309 G allele nor 
TP53 PIN3 among affected children compared with their 
previous generations [103]. Otherwise, this group used 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis among family 
members and identified interesting rare single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs). A curious example was a father (non-
carrier TP53) who transmitted a rare SNV to two out of 
four TP53 mutation carrier children. Children with TP53 
mutation and the rare SNV developed an early cancer but 
not the two TP53 mutation carrier children who not car-
ried that rare SNV. Such rare SNV may be considered as 
candidate-modifier genes that may modulate age at cancer 
onset. Deeper studies looking for these variants could be 
important [103]. In fact, Franceschi et al. reported recently 
an affected child who inherited the TP53 mutation from 
his affected mother (breast cancer in adulthood age) and 
received from their non-affected father 25 predicted del-
eterious variants including a nonsense mutation in ERCC3. 
They proposed that those inherited mutations are possible 
candidate modifiers linked to TP53 [104]. Undiscovered 
genetic variants could determine also Li–Fraumeni hetero-
geneity among members of the same family.

Conclusions

It is very difficult to elucidate the genotype–phenotype rela-
tionship in LFS. Based on the evidence described in the 
present review, not only would the genotype condition phe-
notypic peculiarities, but also the epigenome seems to play 
a key role, although to date, studies in this field are scarce.

The current knowledge of LFS makes it difficult to state 
individual recommendations adapted to the risk at all levels 
of clinical care (genetic counseling in assisted reproductive 
treatments, pediatric or medical oncology). Therefore, it 
is urgent to increase the understanding of this devastating 
entity. The systematic and coordinated study of all the ele-
ments involved in LFS is the only way to move forward.
