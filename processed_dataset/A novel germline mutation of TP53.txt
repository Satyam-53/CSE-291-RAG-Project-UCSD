Abstract 
TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene and, when dysfunctional, it is known to be involved in the development of cancers. 
Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary tumor with autosomal dominant inheritance that develops in people 
with germline pathogenic variants of TP53. LFS frequently develops in parallel to tumors, including breast cancer. 
We describe a novel germline mutation in TP53 identified by performing a multi-gene panel assay in a breast cancer 
patient with bilateral breast cancer.

Background
TP53  has  been  known  as  a  tumor  suppressor  gene  for 
three  decades  and  plays  a  role  in  cell  cycle  regulation, 
including  DNA  repair,  cell  growth  arrest,  and  induction 
of  apoptosis  [1].  The  TP53  gene  consists  of  393  amino 
acids [2], is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 
(17p13.1),  and  is  evolutionally  preserved.  Mutations  in 
TP53  are  most  frequently  detected  in  malignant  tumors 
[3].

Li–Fraumeni  syndrome  (LFS)  is  an  autosomal  domi-
nant hereditary disorder that occurs in patients with ger-
mline mutations in TP53 gene [4]. The diagnosis of LFS 
can  be  established  if  the  patient  conforms  to  the  classi-
cal diagnostic criteria and is family based on the germline 
variant  of  TP53.  When  LFS  is  clinically  suspected,  it  is

recommended  to  go  for  genetic  testing  of  TP53.  LFS  is 
considered a syndrome of high penetrance, with reports 
of  a  lifetime  cancer  risk  of  more  than  70%  in  men  and 
90% in women [5, 6] and an 80% risk of cancer by age 70 
[7]. Recently, germline pathogenic variants of TP53 have 
been  identified,  and  diagnosed  LFS  may  not  meet  the 
classical  LFS  or  Chompret  criteria,  suggesting  that  LFS 
penetrance may be overestimated [8]. Patients frequently 
develop LFS-related tumors, such as breast cancer, osteo-
sarcoma,  soft  tissue  sarcoma,  cerebral  tumor,  and  adre-
nal  cortical  carcinoma,  or  sometimes  have  many  types 
of malignancies simultaneously, including hematological 
and pediatric cancers [9]. It has been suggested that vari-
ant  types  of  TP53  may  influence  clinical  features;  how-
ever,  to  date,  this  has  not  been  fully  elucidated.  In  this 
study, we report a novel TP53 germline pathogenic vari-
ant identified using a multi-gene panel assay in a patient 
with  metachronous  bilateral  breast  cancer  who  had  a 
family history of LFS-related tumors.

Case presentation
The  patient  was  a  woman  who  was  first  diagnosed  with 
cancer in her right breast in her 20s. She underwent right 
breast-conserving  surgery  and  a  sentinel  lymph  node 
biopsy  was  assessed.  The  pathological  diagnosis  was 
ductal carcinoma in situ, pTisN0M0 stage 0, with radia-
tion  therapy  of  50  Gy  in  25  fractions  of  the  right  breast 
but  without  any  adjuvant  systemic  therapies.  Two  years 
after her first diagnosis, she was diagnosed with cancer in 
her left breast and underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy 
with  sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  and  tissue  expander 
insertion  in  her  left  breast.  The  pathological  diagnosis 
was ductal carcinoma in situ and pTisN0M0 stage 0, and 
the  patient  did  not  undergo  radiation  or  adjuvant  sys-
temic therapies. Seven years after her initial diagnosis, a 
recurrent tumor was found in the right breast. Core nee-
dle biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma, which was 
ER 3%, PgR 0%, and HER2 negative, and the subtype was 
almost  triple-negative  breast  cancer.  She  received  pre-
operative  systemic  therapy  with  dose-dense  AC  (doxo-
rubicin  and  cyclophosphamide)  followed  by  dose-dense 
paclitaxel.  She  underwent  nipple-sparing  mastectomy 
with  sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  and  tissue  expander 
insertion  in  the  right  breast.  The  final  pathological 

diagnosis  was  microinvasive  carcinoma  (< 1  mm)  and 
the  therapeutic  effect  was  grade  2b.  After  surgery,  she 
received capecitabine for 6 months as adjuvant systemic 
therapy.  The  patient  had  no  remarkable  medical  history 
including  neoplasms.  Her  family  history  was  as  follows: 
her  older  brother  had  rhabdomyosarcoma  when  he  was 
3 years old, and her mother had breast cancer in her 30s, 
colon  cancer  in  her  60s,  and  skin  cancer  at  63  years  of 
age. The details of other family trees are shown in Fig. 1.

Based  on  her  past  breast  cancer  and  family  history, 
she  was  initially  suspected  of  having  LFS  because  the 
patient met the classical diagnostic criteria for LFS since 
her older brother was defined as the proband. This case 
also  met  the  Chompret  criteria  [10];  that  is,  the  patient 
had  breast  cancer  before  the  age  of  46  years  and  had  a 
second-degree relative with an LFS tumor younger than 
56  years  of  age.  Based  on  these  findings,  this  case  was 
strongly  suspected  to  be  LFS  and  genetically  tested  for 
TP53.  However,  the  hereditary  breast  and  ovarian  can-
cer (HBOC) syndrome has not been ruled out. Therefore, 
the  comprehensive  analysis  of  hereditary  tumor-related 
genes  is  thought  to  be  useful.  She  underwent  a  multi-
gene panel assay with Myriad  myRisk® hereditary cancer 
genetic testing (Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT,

USA).  A  genetic  variant  was  detected,  TP53  c.613T>C 
(p.Tyr205His) (Fig. 2). However, this variant has not been 
reported  as  pathogenic  in  germline  but  somatic  muta-
tion, and the evaluation of multi-gene assay was “special 
interpretation”.  The  suspected  deleterious  variant  was 
consistent with a heterozygous germline mutation, which 
would  cause  the  inherited  cancer  condition  LFS;  how-
ever, some studies have shown that there are cases where 
TP53 mutations detected through genetic testing are not 
present in the germline but rather arise as somatic muta-
tions that may not be present in all tissues.

Therefore,  at  that  time,  the  patient  was  not  diagnosed 
with  LFS.  Next,  we  conducted  further  genetic  analy-
sis  of  her  parents,  single-site  gene  analysis  with  Myriad 
 myRisk®  hereditary  cancer  genetic  testing.  Although  it 
was very hard to access her parents because they lived far 
away and separately, they finally received the genetic test 
with informed consent. Her mother had the same variant 
of  TP53  c.613T>C  (p.Tyr205His),  but  her  father  had  no 
clinically significant mutations. According to the ACMG_
AMP guideline [11], the patient  was evaluated  as “likely 
pathogenic”.  Ten  years  after  her  first  diagnosis  of  breast 
cancer, she underwent gastroscopy for gastric discomfort 
and  was  diagnosed  with  gastric  cancer.  In  this  case,  the 
diagnosis  of  LFS  was  confirmed  based  on  the  results  of 
genetic  testing  of  the  patient  with  heterogeneous  bilat-
eral  breast  cancer  and  her  mother.  At  our  hospital,  the 
Department  of  Clinical  Genetic  Medicine,  in  collabora-
tion with the Department of Breast Surgery, Gynecology, 

Plastic Surgery, and Radiology, has discussed and estab-
lished  a  system  to  avoid  radiation  exposure,  and  estab-
lish  surveillance  and  psychological  intervention  for  the 
patient and her family. Surveillance is performed mainly 
by whole-body MRI and abdominal ultrasonography, and 
comprehensive support is provided.

Discussion
LFS  occurs  in  patients  with  TP53  germline  pathogenic 
variants [4]. The frequency of pathogenic variants in the 
general  population  is  reported  to  be  one  5000–20,000th 
[12, 13]. LFS-related tumors, such as breast cancer, oste-
osarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, brain cancer, and adrenal 
cancer,  occur  at  a  high  rate  from  a  young  age,  and  ones 
such  as  hematologic  malignancy,  epithelial  cancer,  and 
pediatric  cancer  can  also  occur.  Approximately  half  of 
these  cases  occur  simultaneously  or  asynchronously  in 
multiple  malignancies.  Although  the  IBTR  ipsilateral 
breast  tumor  recurrence  rate  is  3.9%  at  10  years  after 
whole-breast  irradiation  [14],  radiation  therapy  in  LFS 
may  increase  the  risk  of  secondary  malignancies  [15]. 
Similarly,  it  has  been  suggested  that  chemotherapeutic 
agents,  especially  alkylating  agents,  may  influence  the 
development  of  hematologic  malignancies  [16].  There-
fore, it is recommended that such treatment and exami-
nation should be avoided whenever possible.

It  has  been  suggested  that  the  types  of  TP53  patho-
genic  variants  and  factors  that  modify  the  function  of 
TP53  affect  its  clinical  features,  but  this  is  not  certain

at this time. LFS can be diagnosed by the detection of a 
pathogenic variant of TP53 [4]. Some individuals who do 
not have a TP53 pathogenic variant may meet the classi-
cal LFS diagnostic criteria and receive that diagnosis. In 
addition,  the  Chompret  criteria  [10]  are  widely  used  as 
the  basis  for  possible  LFS  and  genetic  testing  for  TP53. 
Mutations  in  TP53  c.613T>C  (p.Tyr205His)  were  also 
detected. Notably, this gene mutation has been reported 
as a somatic mutation, but has never been reported as a 
germline mutation, which is annotated as “special inter-
pretation”  at  that  time.  This  mutation  does  not  indicate 
a  definitive  diagnosis  of  LFS  because  there  is  a  possibil-
ity of contamination, such as detection according to the 
treatment  history  of  chemotherapy  or  the  presence  of 
tumor cells in the blood. An experimental study in yeast 
showed  that  this  variant  impairs  the  transcriptional 
transactivation activity of the TP53 protein [17] and dis-
rupts its p.Tyr205 amino acid residue. Other variants that 
disrupt  this  residue  have  been  observed  in  individuals 
with TP53-related conditions [18–20], suggesting that it 
is a clinically significant residue. As a result, variants that 
disrupt  this  residue  are  likely  to  cause  disease.  In  sum-
mary,  the  available  evidence  is  insufficient  to  determine 
the  role  of  this  variant  in  various  diseases.  Therefore,  it 
has been classified as a variant of uncertain significance. 
Studies conducted in human cell lines indicated that this 
alteration is deficient in growth suppression [21, 22]. This 
amino  acid  position  is  highly  conserved  among  verte-
brates.  Additionally,  according  to  in  silico  analysis,  this 
variant  was  predicted  to  be  deleterious.  Based  on  the 
majority of evidence available to date, this variant is likely 
to be pathogenic. To assess this, testing of close relatives 
has been suggested to be useful, and genetic testing of the 
parents has been performed. Because the mother had the 
same  TP53  germline  mutation,  the  patient  was  applied 
to  PM2,  PM5,  PP1,  PP2,  PP3,  PP4,  and  evaluated  as 
“likely pathogenic”, according to the ACMG_AMP guide-
lines  [11].  Segregation  studies  are  necessary  to  provide 
stronger  evidence  to  support  the  pathogenicity  of  this 
variant. However, a segregation study for positive results 
was not possible in this family because all affected indi-
viduals,  except  the  tested  person  and  her  own  mother, 
have already died.

Conclusion
We  reported  a  TP53  germline  mutation,  c.613T>C 
(p.Tyr205His)  as  pathogenic 
the  patient  with 
metachronous bilateral breast cancer using a multi-gene 
panel assay  myRisk® for hereditary cancer. Genetic test-
ing  of  relatives  was  essential  for  diagnosing  pathogenic 
mutations  precisely  as  the   myRisk®  report  suggested  at 
that time.
