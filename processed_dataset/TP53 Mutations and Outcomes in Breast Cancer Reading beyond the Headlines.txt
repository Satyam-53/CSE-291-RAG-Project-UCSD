Abstract

TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, but its role in survival is confounded by 
different studies concluding that TP53 mutations are associated with negative, neutral, or positive 
outcomes. Closer examination showed that many studies were limited by factors such as imprecise 
methods to detect TP53 mutations and small cohorts that combined patients treated with drugs 
having very different mechanisms of action. When only studies of patients receiving the same 
treatment(s) were compared, they tended to agree. These analyses reveal a role for TP53 in 
response to different treatments as complex as its different biological activities. We discuss studies 
that have assessed the role of TP53 mutations in breast cancer treatment and limitations in 
interpreting reported results.

TP53 Mutation Status and Clinical Outcomes in Breast Cancer

TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer [1]. TP53 codes for the transcription 
factor p53, which initiates transcription of genes involved in processes such as cell cycle 
arrest, apoptosis, metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular senescence in response to stressors 
like radiation and chemotherapy [2,3]. TP53 mutations occur predominantly in the DNA 
binding domain, thus rendering the mutant p53 protein transcriptionally inactive in response 
to stress [4]. While the degree of p53 induction and the specific targets transactivated by p53 
vary by tumor and cell type, wild type p53 activity is generally thought to confer a favorable 
prognosis in cancer [2,5].

In breast cancer, TP53 is mutated in nearly 30% of all cases and is the most frequently 
mutated gene [1]. As every molecular subtype of breast cancer contains tumors with mutant 
TP53 [1], many preclinical and clinical studies have attempted to discern the role of p53 in 
breast cancer. However, the clinical relevance of TP53 mutation status in breast cancers has 
been confounded by different studies showing that TP53 mutations are associated with 
negative, neutral, or positive outcomes (e.g., [6–9]).

In this review, we examine these past studies and why they differed so markedly in their 
conclusions, revealing that many have been limited by various factors. These include using 
imprecise methods to determine tumor TP53 status and using different clinical endpoints to 
assess predictive or prognostic significance of TP53 mutations. Perhaps the most 
confounding factor, however, has been the use of relatively small sample sizes of patients 
that fail to properly account for heterogeneity in subtype and, importantly, treatment 
regimens.

Treatment Strategies for Management of Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with many different treatment options that can 
include combinations of surgery, chemotherapies, hormonal therapies (herein termed 
‘HRT’), therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and no 
treatment [10,11]. Different options exist within each of these categories as well. The 
primary determinant of optimal treatment is the presence or absence of molecular markers 
for steroid hormone receptors (HR) [estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor], and 
HER2 [11].

Chemotherapies routinely used in clinic for breast cancer include DNA-damaging 
anthracycline- and nonanthracycline-based drugs. Anthracycline-based therapies, such as 
doxorubicin and epirubicin, exert cytotoxic effects by intercalating into the DNA-
topoisomerase II complex and interfering with DNA synthesis [12,13]. Nonanthracycline-
based DNA-damaging therapies are broader in mechanism of action and include DNA-
alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide [14] and antimetabolites like 5-fluorouracil that 
interfere with DNA synthesis [15]. Similarly, radiation treatment causes DNA damage by 
generating strand breaks [16]. Breast cancer is also treated with non-DNA damaging 
taxanes, which interfere with mitotic cell division through disruption of microtubule 
function [17]. p53 activity is critical in determining the fate of cells with stress caused by 
DNA damage [2,18] or mitotic failure [19].

Chemotherapy can be administered either as a neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment [20]. 
Adjuvant treatments are therapies delivered after the primary treatment (i.e., surgical 
resection of tumor). Neoadjuvant treatments are therapies delivered prior to the primary 
treatment. This allows pathologists to determine how effective the treatment was in 
shrinking the tumor by evaluating the presence or absence of residual disease, according to 
the following criteria: (i) complete response (CR), (ii) partial response, (iii) stable disease, 
and (iv) progressive disease (PD) [21].

HR-positive breast cancers are routinely treated with HRTs that interfere with HR-signaling 
pathways that drive these cancers. HRTs are comprised of several classes of drugs, including 
selective ER modulators, selective ER degraders, and aromatase inhibitors (reviewed in [22–
25]).

In addition to biological factors, breast cancer treatment can vary from patient to patient due 
to patient and physician preferences, institutional guidelines, access to healthcare, insurance 
coverage [11], and reimbursement incentives [26–28]. Simply put, breast cancer is a

multitude of biological and nonbiological factors.

Methods for Detection of TP53 Mutation Status in Breast Cancer

Because of the clearly important role for p53 in cancer development and progression, 
including in breast cancer, scientists and clinicians have examined how TP53 mutation 
correlates with clinical outcomes. These studies have used several techniques to determine 
TP53 mutation status, including DNA sequencing, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, 
and yeast-based functional assays.

IHC Staining

Many earlier studies utilized positive IHC staining as a surrogate marker for p53 mutation. 
Missense mutations in the TP53 DNA-binding domain, which account for the majority of 
mutations in the gene, often cause hyperstabilization of the p53 protein that can be detected 
by strong nuclear IHC staining [29]. However, some point mutations, splice variants, 
frameshift mutations, and all truncating alterations in TP53 will fail to result in a stable 
protein; thus, using IHC to determine p53 status in these cases will incorrectly designate 
these tumors TP53 wild type [29,30]. This is significant because recent studies using more 
sensitive methods of detection show ~40% of TP53 mutations in breast cancer will not 
produce a stable protein [31]. Moreover, wild type p53 protein can stain positively by IHC in 
tumor samples [7,32]. In fact, it is estimated that correlation between p53 accumulation 
measured by IHC and TP53 mutations determined through DNA sequencing is less than 
75% in breast cancer [33]. Thus, due to these limitations of the technique, some patients 
who are inferred to have TP53 wild type tumors based on IHC may in fact have TP53 
mutant tumors and some designated as mutant because of positive IHC staining may be wild 
type. This inaccuracy likely confounds survival analysis on mutation status determined by 
IHC [7].

Yeast-Based Functional Assay

TP53 mutation status can also be determined through a yeast-based functional assay. In this 
assay, RNA is extracted from patient tumor biopsies and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. 
TP53 transcripts are then amplified by PCR and transfected into yeast with an integrated p53 
transcription reporter plasmid. Yeast colonies that are transfected with wild type p53 will 
form white colonies and colonies transfected with mutant and thus transcriptionally inactive 
p53 will form red colonies [34].

DNA-Sequencing

TP53 mutations are also detected in breast cancer by DNA sequencing [35]. Early studies 
showed that the majority of mutations in TP53 occur in exons 5–8 of the gene [36]. In turn, 
this is the region that has been most frequently, and often exclusively, sequenced [37]. 
Studies that only assess mutations in this region will designate patients with TP53 mutation 
in other exons as wild type. Next generation sequencing methods have allowed for detection 
of TP53 mutations outside of the exon 5–8 region [35]. DNA sequencing is regarded as the 
gold standard for identifying TP53 mutations [38].

TP53 Mutation Status and Survival of Breast Cancer Patients: Studies That 

Combine all Treatments and Subtypes

When TP53 status is taken into account in large heterogeneous populations that combine all 
treatments and subtypes, many studies demonstrate that patients with TP53 mutant tumors 
have worse survival than patients with TP53 wild type tumors.

One of the earliest studies of TP53 mutation status and breast cancer survival was performed 
by Ostrowski et al. [39]. They analyzed the correlation of p53 IHC expression and survival 
of 90 breast cancer patients. They determined that there was no significant difference in 
survival between patients with p53 positive and negative tumors. In another study of p53 
expression and survival in 31 breast cancer patients, p53 positivity by IHC was associated 
with worse overall survival (OS) (P <0.01) [40]. However, the number of patients with p53 
positive tumors was relatively small (n = 5) and patient treatment exposures were not 
reported. In a later study of 73 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, p53 overexpression 
by IHC was associated with worse postrelapse survival (P <0.0001) [41]. In this study, while 
all patients received HRT, some patients received chemotherapy while others did not. Also, 
survival analysis for clinical endpoints like OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were not 
reported. In all of these studies, TP53 status was inferred based on IHC expression of p53, 
which is now regarded as an inaccurate method of mutation detection (discussed above).

Studies that employed more accurate sequencing methodology have generally agreed with 
studies using IHC. Bergh et al. found that patients with TP53 mutant tumors had worse OS 
(P = 0.001) and RFS (P = 0.002) than patients with wild type tumors [42]. This study 
included patients that were treated with very different therapies, including radiotherapy, 
HRT, and/or different chemotherapies. Shiao et al. assessed the role of TP53 mutation status 
in breast cancer survival in black and white patients [43]. While TP53 mutations were 
associated with worse survival in black patients (n = 45, P = 0.012), there was no survival 
difference between white patients with or without mutations in TP53 (n = 47, P = 0.670). 
These patients were treated with different therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy, and HRT. In a later study of 90 patients with breast cancer, Blaszyk et al. 
determined that patients with TP53 mutant tumors had worse OS (P = 0.0001) and disease-
free survival (DFS) (P = 0.003) compared with patients that have TP53 wild type tumors 
[44]. These patients were treated with a variety of therapies, including systemic 
chemotherapy for positive lymph nodes and/or HRT if tumors were positive for ER. 
Andersson et al. determined that in a cohort of 396 breast cancer patients, those with TP53 
mutant tumors had worse OS (P = 0.0005) compared with patients that have wild type 
tumors [45].

In this study, however, treatments included different combinations of therapies like HRT and 
chemotherapy. Rossner, Jr. et al. found in a study of 859 patients with breast cancer that 
TP53 mutations were associated with poor breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality 
[46]. While this study included a large sample size of patients, it was noted that follow-up 
information like treatment history was missing for many of the patients. Olivier et al. noted 
in a study of 1794 breast cancer patients that those with tumors harboring TP53 mutations in 
exons 5–8 of the gene had a worse risk of dying of breast cancer within 10 years following

surgery (P <0.0001) [47]. However, treatment history for patients included in this study was 
not provided. Meric-Bernstam et al. reported that amongst 165 patients with HR+ metastatic 
breast cancer, patients with TP53 mutant tumors had worse OS (P = 0.003) [48]. However, 
some of these patients were treated with chemotherapy, while others were not.

While these studies suggest TP53 mutations are correlated with worse survival in breast 
cancer, as noted, many report differences in key elements such as patient treatment 
stratifications, clinical endpoints, and TP53 mutation detection methods. Specifically, many 
of these studies used IHC to infer p53 status, performed analysis on heterogeneously treated 
patients, and were powered by small sample sizes. In turn, it is difficult to compare these 
studies to clarify the role of TP53 mutations in breast cancer survival.

The METABRIC Dataset Allows Stratification of Different Treatments

As a result of the complexity of breast cancer treatment, cross-comparisons and meta-
analyses of studies on the role of TP53 mutations in breast cancer have been exceedingly 
difficult. Individual studies, however, have not generally been powered by a sufficient 
sample size to comprehensively analyze TP53 mutations and survival across different 
clinical and treatment groups. To resolve the deficiencies found in previous reports, our 
group performed an analysis [49] of the large METABRIC dataseti of primary breast cancer 
patients [50].

This study was powered by a large sample size of patients (n = 1979), treatment histories 
were properly annotated, and all patient tumors were sequenced, allowing for reliable 
stratification of patients based on TP53 mutation status [50,51]. When OS was compared 
between patients stratified by TP53 mutation status across multiple clinical features (all 
patients, regardless of treatment) patients with TP53 mutant tumors had shorter median OS 
compared with patients that have TP53 wild type tumors (P <0.0001) [49] (Figure 1A).

Stratifying by Different Treatment Types: TP53 Status and HRT Response in 

Breast Cancer

TP53 is mutated in approximately 20% of HR-positive breast cancers [49]. Because of this 
prevalence, studies have aimed to determine the role of TP53 mutation status in response to 
HRT. For example, Archer et al. found that in 92 patients treated with first-line HRT, those 
patients with p53-positive and negative tumors by IHC had no difference in survival (P = 
0.71) [52]. Elledge et al. found in a study of 205 patients with ER-positive, metastatic breast 
cancer that patients with higher p53 IHC expression had worse survival after HRT (P = 
0.008) [53]. Konduri et al. determined that amongst 35 ER-positive breast cancer patients 
treated with tamoxifen, patients with p53-positive tumors by IHC had superior survival 
compared with patients that have p53-negative tumors (P = 0.007) [54]. In all of these 
studies, however, it is unclear whether patients received treatments in addition to HRT. Also, 
p53 status was determined via IHC, which may have incorrectly designated some TP53 
mutation status (discussed above).

Studies on the role of TP53 mutation and response to HRT are limited and those identified 
just above may include some patients treated with therapies in addition to HRT. Our analysis

additional therapies, demonstrated that patients with TP53 mutant tumors had worse OS 
compared with patients that have wild type tumors (P <0.0001) (Figure 1F).

TP53 Status and Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer

Chemotherapy is frequently used in the management of breast cancer. In fact, patients with 
triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack targeted therapy options and are primarily 
treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen.

p53 and the Apoptotic Response to Cell Stress

Chemotherapy and radiation treatments inflict DNA damage on tumor cells. One of the first 
functions identified for p53 was the induction of apoptosis after DNA damage. In classic 
studies, mice that lack p53 failed to undergo apoptosis in radiosensitive organs after 
exposure to irradiation [55]. Subsequent studies using mouse fibrosarcoma models showed 
p53 activation of apoptosis was critical for the response to DNA damaging chemotherapy 
[56]. p53 is also activated in response to mitotic stress caused by agents such as taxanes that 
disrupt microtubules [57].

Subsequent research demonstrated that p53 is a potent transcription factor [58] that, in 
response to stress, turns on genes such as PUMA, NOXA, PERP, and BAX that directly 
mediate apoptosis [59]. Because Lowe et al. [56] and other studies demonstrated that p53 
triggers apoptosis when a cell incurs significant DNA damage, it was often presumed that 
functional p53 activity is necessary for a robust response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy 
[60]. However, p53 also transactivates the CDKN1A gene, coding for the potent cell cycle 
inhibitor p21 [61–63] and thus can halt the cell cycle and, in some contexts, activate a 
program of cellular senescence instead of apoptosis [64]. Because of the critical role p53 
plays in cellular responses to chemotherapy, many groups have expanded p53 studies into 
other tumor types, including breast cancer. Interestingly, TP53 is mutant in 30% of all breast 
cancers and nearly 80% of TNBCs [1]. Thus, many breast cancer patients who will receive 
first-line chemotherapy treatment have tumors harboring TP53 mutations and many studies 
have attempted to clarify the role of these mutations in chemotherapy response, as research 
has seemingly produced mixed results.

TP53 Mutated Tumors Are More Likely to Undergo CR after Chemotherapy

Two frequently used endpoints for evaluating chemotherapy efficacy are: (i) the extent of 
residual disease present at the time of surgery following a chemotherapy regimen; (ii) 
survival (overall or relapse/disease-free). Contrary to a role for wild type p53 in activating 
apoptotic cell death that results in tumor regression after chemotherapy, numerous studies 
have now shown that TP53 mutant breast cancers have significantly higher rates of 
pathologic complete response (pCR) compared with wild type breast cancers.

Perhaps the first report to suggest TP53 mutation might actually be beneficial to 
chemotherapy response in breast cancer came from Bertheau et al. [65]. The authors showed 
that out of 50 non-inflammatory locally advanced breast cancers treated with high doses of 
epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, all of the pCRs occurred in TP53-mutated tumors (TP53

wild type: 0/36, TP53 mutant: 8/14; P <0.0001). A follow-up study by the same group 
showed that in a cohort of similarly treated breast cancer patients, 36.5% (23/63) of patients 
with TP53 mutated tumors underwent pCR compared with 0% (0/65) of patients that have 
wild type tumors [66]. Both studies utilized a sensitive yeast-based functional assay to 
determine mutation status of TP53. Numerous other studies and meta-analyses have 
confirmed these initial findings.

In a study of 198 TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), p53 
expression detected by IHC was predictive of pCR after NAC [67]. Wang et al. found in a 
study of primary breast cancer patients treated with NAC that patients with TP53 mutant 
tumors had higher rates of pCR compared with patients that have wild type tumors [68]. 
Gluck et al. similarly determined that patients with TP53 mutated breast cancers had a 
superior response rate to NAC compared with wild type patients (TP53 mutant: 30%, TP53 
wild type: 10%; P = 0.0032) [69].

Geisler et al. suggest that certain TP53 mutations can portend poor response to 
chemotherapy [70]. In their study of 91 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin, only 
patients with tumors that were mutated for the TP53 L2 or L3 loop domains responded 
poorly to treatment (P = 0.063 for all TP53 mutations and P = 0.008 for L2/L3 mutations). 
Notably, 12 of the patients included in this study had metastases at diagnosis. In a later study 
of 35 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin, Geisler et al. similarly reported that 
patients with TP53 L2/L3 mutated tumors had worse response to treatment (P = 0.177 for all 
mutations and P = 0.006 for L2/L3 mutations) [71].

One study found that TP53 gene mutations were associated with poor response to treatment 
with a neoadjuvant regimen of 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (P = 0.0029) 
[72]. However, there were only seven patients with TP53 mutated tumors treated with this 
regimen, as compared with 28 patients that have TP53 wild type tumors.

Two studies have reported no role for TP53 mutation and response; however, these utilized 
IHC as the method of mutation detection and/or had very small sample sizes [73,74].

While there is some conflict in the conclusions of these studies, in a meta-analysis of 3476 
breast cancer cases across 26 different studies, Chen et al. reported that mutant TP53 status 
(assigned using IHC and/or sequencing) was associated with increased rates of pCR 
following NAC treatment [9].

As multiple studies and a meta-analysis have shown the superior rates of pCR for TP53 
mutant tumors in response to chemotherapy, one might surmise that these patients would 
have superior survival. However, studies have conflicted and only recently have explanations 
emerged.

TP53 Mutation Status and Survival Studies That Combine Patients That Received 
Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy plus HRT

A number of studies suggest that, despite having significantly better rates of pCR, TP53 
mutant breast cancers have worse survival after chemotherapy compared with their wild type

counterparts. However, conclusions about p53 and chemotherapy response reached by these 
reports are confounded for multiple reasons, making comparisons difficult.

The overwhelming majority of reports of TP53 status and survival after chemotherapy 
include patients treated with therapies in addition to chemotherapy. For example, in a study 
of 63 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, four out of the six patients with PD 
following anthracycline-based (doxorubicin) treatment had TP53 mutant tumors [75]. 
However, 59 out of 63 of the total patients included in this study were determined to be HR-
positive by IHC and were thus likely treated with HRT in addition to chemotherapy. In a 
second publication based on an extended survival study of these patients treated with 
doxorubicin, patients with TP53 mutant tumors experienced significantly reduced RFS and 
OS compared with patients that have TP53 wild type tumors (RFS: 14 vs 83 months, P 
<0.001; OS: 35 versus 90 months, P <0.001) [76]. Similar to their earlier study, this study 
included primarily HR-positive patients who were stated to have received adjuvant HRT in 
addition to chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients with TP53 mutant tumors also had worse 
survival after a regimen of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin compared with patients that have wild 
type tumors (OS: 22 vs 80 months, P = 0.03) [76]. Likewise, the patients included in this 
study were primarily HR-positive patients who were treated with adjuvant HRT.

Fernandez-Cuesta et al. reported that in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with 
adjuvant doxorubicin +/− docetaxel, DFS and OS was comparable between patients with 
TP53 wild type and mutant tumors (n = 520; DFS: P = 0.577, OS: P = 0.367) [77]. Further 
stratification of patients by TP53 mutation class (missense vs truncating mutations) showed 
truncating mutations in TP53 were associated with a significant reduction in both DFS and 
OS (P <0.001). In this study, over 70% of patients also received HRT. Two other studies 
using IHC to infer TP53 mutation status showed that p53 expression had no prognostic value 
in the response to chemotherapy [78,79].

In a study of stage III breast cancer, patients with TP53 mutations were shown to have worse 
DFS following treatment with paclitaxel (P = 0.007) [80]. Nearly half the patients included 
in this analysis were ER-positive and received some form of HRT. Further, only differences 
in DFS were reported. In the I-SPY-1 clinical trial, Esserman et al. determined from a cohort 
of 120 breast cancer patients who were treated with NAC that while patients with TP53 
mutant tumors had higher rates of pCR (P <0.001), patients with TP53 wild type tumors had 
better RFS (P <0.05) [81]. In this clinical trial, while all patients received NAC, many 
patients received HRT.

Studies using IHC to infer TP53 mutation status also showed that patients with p53-positive 
tumors had worse OS and/or DFS compared with patients that have p53-negative tumors 
after chemotherapy +/− HRT [82–86]. Also, one study using IHC showed that patients with 
p53-positive tumors had higher rates of PD after chemotherapy [87]. In each of these studies 
[82–84,86,87], a varying percentage of patients also received HRT.

In sum, while the majority of studies above correlate TP53 mutations to worse survival after 
chemotherapy, they each include a mix of patients that received chemotherapy alone and 
chemotherapy plus HRT and ratios that vary markedly. Further, many of these studies were

powered by small sample sizes and differ in methodology such as TP53 mutation detection. 
These differences confound comparisons between studies, which may lead to conflicting 
conclusions regarding TP53 mutations and response/survival after chemotherapy.

Our analysis of the METABRIC dataset on all chemotherapy-treated primary breast cancer 
patients revealed survival was not significantly different between patients with TP53 wild 
type and mutant tumors (Figure 1B). This cohort that included chemotherapy-treated and 
chemotherapy plus HRT-treated patients is in agreement with larger studies in the previous 
section [77–79].

We next identified studies that analyzed cohorts with patients who were all treated with 
either chemotherapy and HRT or chemotherapy alone.

TP53 Mutation Status and Survival Studies of Patients That Only Received Chemotherapy 
plus HRT

Studies reviewed above suggest that chemotherapy-treated patients with TP53 mutant breast 
tumors have worse or similar survival, despite having much higher rates of pCR than 
patients with TP53 wild type tumors. As noted above, nearly all of these studies combined 
ER-negative patients with ER-positive patients that were also treated with HRT. Taken 
together, the seemingly contradictory findings in studies examining pCR rate and survival 
suggest the possibility that HRT may affect survival of patients with TP53 mutant and wild 
type tumors differently. Most studies, however, failed to separate ER positive and negative 
patients in survival analysis due to relatively small sample sizes.

We have identified studies that analyzed the survival of only those patients that received both 
chemotherapy and HRT and excluded patients receiving chemotherapy or HRT alone, 
untreated patients, etc. Kim et al. found in a study of 17 breast cancer patients that those 
with TP53 wild type tumors treated with chemotherapy and HRT had superior survival 
compared with patients that have TP53 mutant tumors [88]. Patients (n = 1964) with p53 
IHC negative tumors who received chemotherapy followed by HRT had RFS comparable 
with patients that have p53-positive tumors (P = 0.128) [89]. Andersson et al. showed 
patients treated with cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) and HRT had no 
difference in OS, whether the tumor was TP53 wild type or mutant (P = 0.27) [45].

Our analysis of the METABRIC dataset showed patients with TP53 wild type tumors had 
marginally better survival (significant in univariate analysis only) compared with patients 
that have TP53 mutant tumors when chemotherapy plus HRT was administered (Figure 1D).

TP53 Mutation Status and Survival Studies of Patients That Received Only Chemotherapy

As discussed, p53 mediates the cell response to stress, such as that caused by DNA damage 
or aberrant mitoses. Thus, a close examination of patients that received only chemotherapy 
is warranted.

In one study of TP53 mutation in 1275 breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, the 
authors showed patients with p53-positive and -negative tumors by IHC had comparable 
RFS (P = 0.359) [89]. However, it was observed that amongst patients age >50 years (n =

427), those with p53-positive tumors had better RFS than patients with p53-negative tumors 
(P = 0.027). In another study of 37 ER-negative patients with metastatic breast cancer, 
patients with TP53 mutant tumors had better OS compared with patients that have wild type 
tumors (P = 0.026) [88]. However, some patients in this cohort harbored HER2+ tumors and 
received targeted treatment and, though statistically significant, the number of TP53 wild 
type patients was small (n = 2). Despite the limitations of these studies, they suggest a 
survival benefit for patients with TP53 mutant tumors.

In our analysis of chemotherapy-only treated patients in the METABRIC dataset, we showed 
that patients with TP53 mutant tumors had significantly longer survival than patients with 
wild type tumors (TP53 mutant tumors: median survival 195 months, TP53 wild type 
tumors: median survival 45 months, P = 0.0072) (Figure 1E). This finding was true in all 
subtypes, including basal-like or triple negative tumors. For example, in TNBC patients, 
median survival for those with TP53 mutant tumors was 263 months and for TP53 wild type, 
45 months (P = 0.0083) [49]. These data from METABRIC are consistent with the high rate 
of pCR observed in previous neoadjuvant studies.

Some studies with very short follow up, however, have not found a survival advantage 
associated with TP53 mutation. In 174 TNBC patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy 
after curative surgery, TP53 mutation status had no impact on patient survival [90]. In this 
study, only 49% of TNBC were determined by sequencing to be TP53 mutant and distant 
RFS was at least 80% in all treatment arms. Darb-Esfahani et al. examined TP53 mutation 
rates in 450 breast cancers treated with NAC and while their study confirmed high rates of 
mutations in TNBC, mutation status did not predict survival rates [91]. Of note, the cohort 
had only been followed for 50 months and ~80–90% of patients in all arms were still alive.

Interesting Case of TP53 Mutation Status and Response to Chemotherapy Alone versus 
Chemotherapy plus HRT

Both individual smaller studies and analysis of the large METABRIC dataset showed that 
patients with TP53 mutant tumors had superior survival after treatment with chemotherapy 
alone (Figure 1E). However, when chemotherapy plus HRT are given, the advantage to 
having a TP53 mutation disappears (Figure 1D). A closer examination revealed, in fact, that 
TP53 mutant tumors responded very well to chemotherapy plus HRT. Addition of HRT 
actually failed to extend survival at all in these patients [49]. The patients with TP53 wild 
type tumors, however, derived an enormous benefit from addition of HRT, extending 
survival from 46 months (Figure 1E) to 206 months (Figure 1D). In this way, HRT appears 
to be an ‘equalizer’ in survival between patients with TP53 wild type and mutant tumors that 
are treated with chemotherapy.

In studies of heterogeneously treated patients discussed above, a greater number of TP53 
wild type patients that are able to receive HRT will dramatically skew the curve toward 
longer survival. If a large fraction of TP53 wild type patients are ER negative, then median 
survival will skew much shorter. In future studies this should be accounted for, or, more 
optimally, populations of patients getting different treatments should be segregated into 
separate survival curves.

Why Do TP53 Mutant Tumors Respond Differently to Treatment with Chemotherapy and/or 
HRT?

Many studies assessed the role of TP53 mutation status in survival after chemotherapy in 
patients treated with chemotherapy and HRT. Combining these patient populations makes it 
difficult to reach any conclusions regarding the role of TP53 mutations in the response to 
chemotherapy for many reasons.

First, while it is well-established that p53 plays a central role in cellular response to DNA-
damaging agents like chemotherapy, the role of p53 in cellular responses to HRT is much 
less clear. Some preclinical studies suggest that p53 interacts with ER, leading to speculation 
that p53 may play a role in cancer sensitivity to HRT [54,92]. However, even preclinical 
studies have conflicted on the result of p53 and ER interactions, with some studies showing 
that ER represses p53 activity [93] and others showing that ER augments p53 activity [94]. 
Preclinical data suggest that breast cancer cell lines with mutated p53 are less responsive to 
HRT [95,96]. These data support the survival studies on HRT-treated patients discussed 
above. Thus, how p53 regulates the cellular response to HRT remains largely unclear and is 
likely not related to how p53 responds to DNA damage or mitotic stress. More research is 
warranted and this includes studies of patients that receive no chemotherapy (Figure 1C) or 
no treatment (Figure 1G).

The question of how wild type p53 mediates a poor response to chemotherapy treatment has 
been addressed in several studies. As mentioned, p53 directs cells to undergo apoptosis in 
response to chemotherapy in many cell and tumor types. This well-characterized function is 
counter to the observations in breast cancer: p53 wild type tumors are less likely to undergo 
massive cell death and a pCR and have worse survival after chemotherapy treatment alone. 
Evidence from breast cancer models and tumors have shown p53 directs cells to undergo cell 
cycle arrest and senescence [97–99]. Cells of the senescent tumors secrete chemokines and 
cytokines of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [100] that can drive protumor 
phenotypes such as survival, metastasis, and proliferation [101]. One mechanism that 
contributes to senescent cell survival and persistence in the residual disease after 
chemotherapy treatment is the engulfing and cannibalizing of neighboring cells [102]. Less 
well understood is how the senescent cells avoid immune detection and clearance [101].

Concluding Remarks

Our analysis revealed the importance of looking beyond the headlines and titles of 
manuscripts to understand the role TP53 plays in breast cancer treatment response. The 
patient characteristics, treatment regimens, and methodologies behind declarations of ‘TP53 
mutation predicts better/worse/no different survival’ should be examined carefully. p53 
activation and the cellular outcomes it dictates are complicated and context dependent. It is 
unsurprising that TP53 mutation plays very different roles in outcomes based on the very 
different biological consequences caused by treatments as disparate as DNA damage and 
hormone deprivation. Functional p53 directs breast cancer cells to undergo cell cycle arrest 
and senescence in response to chemotherapy, leaving residual disease that is highly 
refractory and resistant to immune clearance. In these treatment settings where wild type

Highlights

TP53 is mutant in 30% of all breast cancers and is the most frequently mutated gene. The 
role of TP53 in the management of breast cancer remains unclear.

Recent analysis reveals that mutant p53 can be detrimental or beneficial to clinical 
outcome, depending on treatments given.

Because p53 has diverse activities in response to different treatments, each treatment 
should ideally have its own survival arm.

Outstanding Questions

Can therapies that target residual senescent cells improve outcomes for chemotherapy-
treated TP53 wild type breast cancer patients?

Can immunotherapy be sequenced following chemotherapy to promote clearance of 
residual disease?

Should TP53 mutation status be taken into consideration in determining whether patients 
are candidates for HRT?

Figure 1. Breast Cancer Patient Survival after Stratification for TP53 Status and Treatment.
Median survival was determined for patients from the METABRIC database, stratified by 
TP53 mutation status and treatment exposure. Studies that analyzed patients under similar 
treatment conditions are listed in adjacent captions. (A) All patients (P <0.0001). (B) All 
chemotherapy-treated patients (P = ns). (C) All patients who did not receive chemotherapy 
(P <0.0001). (D) All patients treated with chemotherapy + HRT (P <0.05). (E) All patients 
treated with chemotherapy alone (P <0.05). (F) All patients treated with HRT only (P 
<0.0001). (G) All patients who did not receive chemotherapy or HRT (P = ns). 
Abbreviations: HRT, hormonal therapies; mut, mutant; ns, not significant; OS, overall 
survival; WT, wild type. (See [9,39–49,52–54,65–91].)
