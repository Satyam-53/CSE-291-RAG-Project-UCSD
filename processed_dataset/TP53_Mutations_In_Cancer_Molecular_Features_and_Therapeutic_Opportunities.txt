Abstract. The tumour suppressor factor p53 plays an essential 
role in regulating numerous cellular processes, including the 
cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, autophagy, cell metabolism 
and immune response. TP53 is the most commonly mutated 
gene  in  human  cancers.  These  mutations  are  primarily 
non‑synonymous changes that produce mutant p53 proteins 
characterized by loss of function, a dominant negative effect 
on  p53  tetramerisation  and  gain  of  function  (GOF).  GOF 
mutations not only disrupt the tumour‑suppressive activities 
of p53 but also endow the mutant proteins with new oncogenic 
properties.  Recent  studies  analysing  different  pathogenic 
features of mutant p53 in cancer‑derived cell lines have demon‑
strated  that  restoring  wild‑type  p53,  rather  than  removing 
GOF mutations, reduces cancer cell growth. These findings 
suggest that therapeutic strategies for reactivating wild‑type 
p53 function in cancer cells may bring a greater benefit than 
approaches halting mutant p53. This approach could involve 
the use of small molecules, gene therapy and other methods to 
re‑establish wild‑type p53 activity. This review describes the 
complexity of the biological activities of different p53 mutants 
and summarizes the current therapeutic approaches to restore 
p53 function.

1. Introduction

The p53 protein was first described in 1979 by several research 
groups as a cellular factor forming a complex with the simian 
virus  40  large  tumour  antigen  (1,2).  Subsequent  studies 
demonstrated  excessive  accumulation  of  p53  both  in  cells 
expressing viral tumour antigens and in cancer cells negative 
for viral infections, whereas p53 levels were low in normal, 
uninfected cells (3,4). In the early 1980s, p53 was recognised 
as an oncoprotein whose upregulation by tumour viruses or 
other mechanisms could contribute to cellular transforma‑
tion (5,6). Indeed, the TP53 cDNA cloned from various cancer 
cell lines was shown to immortalise primary cells, induce 
multilayer cell growth and promote tumourigenicity in animal 
models, thereby experimentally substantiating the oncogenic 
role of p53 in tumour development (7,8). In the late 1980s, 
DNA sequencing of the TP53 gene isolated from tumour cells 
revealed frequent missense mutations conferring oncogenic 
features  to  the  mutant  p53  proteins  (9,10).  Conversely,  the 
expression of wild‑type p53 in transformed cells was shown 
to  suppress  the  transformed  phenotype  without  inducing 
damaging effects in non‑transformed cells (11,12). The critical 
role of p53 as a tumour suppressor was further demonstrated 
in  patients  with  Li‑Fraumeni  syndrome,  associated  with 
monoallelic germline TP53 mutations and characterized by a 
high predisposition to various cancer types, including breast 
cancer, sarcomas, brain tumours, leukaemia and adrenal gland 
cancers (13,14). The observation that tumours developing in 
patients with Li‑Fraumeni syndrome have lost the wild‑type 
TP53 allele definitively established p53 as a tumour suppressor 
factor (15).

The scientific evidence accumulated over the past 40 years 
since  the  discovery  of  p53  has  shown  that  this  oncosup‑
pressor  is  involved  in  regulating  a  broad  range  of  cellular 
processes (16,17). These include cell cycle control, activation 
of DNA repair mechanisms in response to genetic damages, 
programmed cell death in response to severe cellular stress, 
induction of cell senescence and regulation of metabolic path‑
ways (Fig. 1) (18,19). Therefore, mutations within the TP53 
gene and expression of mutant p53 proteins can be considered 
to be involved in virtually all hallmarks of cancer (20).

TP53  is  the  most  commonly  mutated  gene  in  human 
cancers, with mutation frequencies exceeding 50% in at least 
20 tumour types, including colorectal, ovarian and oesopha‑
geal carcinoma and lung cancer (Fig. 2). Certain nucleotide

changes in the TP53 gene have been recognized as molecular 
signatures of carcinogen exposure in tumours developing in 
specific organs, such as aflatoxin B1 and G to T transversion at 
codon 249 in hepatocellular carcinoma, tobacco smoking and 
G to T transversion at specific G:C base pairs in lung cancer, 
and ultraviolet light irradiation leading to CC to TT tandem 
mutations in skin cancers (21,22). In addition, a significant 
proportion of TP53 mutations consist of G:C to A:T transitions 
at CpG sites, possibly originating from spontaneous deamina‑
tion of DNA bases (23). However, numerous aspects regarding 
the cause of TP53 mutations, their diverse activities in cancer 
cells and therapeutic opportunities in tumours harbouring p53 
mutations remain mostly unknown.

2. Mutations in TP53 gene

The  human  TP53  gene  is  ~20  kilobases  long,  contains  11 
exons and encodes a zinc‑coordinated protein composed of 
393 amino acids (24). In normal cells, p53 protein is present 
at low levels, with an unstable conformation and short half‑life 
due to continuous degradation mediated by its negative regu‑
lator mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) (25,26).

The p53 protein contains two transcriptional activation 
domains  (TAD),  namely  TAD1  comprising  amino  acids 
(aa)21-28 and TAD2 comprising aa47-55, and a proline-rich 
sequence (aa62-94) at the N-terminal region, a DNA-binding 
domain (DBD, aa94-292) and a tetramerisation domain (TET, 
aa318-355) in the central region, as well as a nuclear local‑
ization signal and sites of post-translational modifications 
at the C-terminal domain (RD, aa363-393) (Fig. 3) (27-29). 
The p53 TAD1 induces the transcriptional activation of genes 
involved in cell cycle arrest, such as cyclin dependent kinase 
inhibitor 1A CDKN1A), and regulates apoptosis by activating 
the BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX), BCL2 
binding component 3 (PUMA), NADPH oxidase activator 
(NOXA) and BCL2 associated agonist of cell death genes. 
Both  TAD1  and  TAD2  participate  in  tumour  suppression 
and binding to MDM2 (Fig. 1) (30,31). The p53 DBD domain 
interacts with specific p53-responsive elements consisting 
of  two  copies  of  5'‑RRRCWWGYYY‑3'  DNA  sequences 
that  are  located  in  the  regulatory  regions  (enhancers  and 
promoters) of genes regulated by the p53 protein (32). The 
TET  domain,  involved  in  p53  tetramerisation,  allows  the 
appropriate conformation of p53 and interaction with target 
DNA sequences (33). The RD region regulates the binding of 
DBD to p53‑responsive elements in the p53‑regulated genes, 
depending on post-translational modifications such as acety‑
lation, phosphorylation and sumoylation (34‑40). The p53 
C‑terminal domain also contains nuclear export and localisa‑
tion signals, which are important for its vehiculation to the 
nucleus as well as for transferring p53 into the cytoplasm for 
degradation (41,42).

Mutations in the TP53 gene have been shown to confer to 
cells new biological features, such as increased proliferation, 
deregulated metabolism, metastatic potential and an altered 
tumour microenvironment, as well as resistance to chemo‑
therapy and radiotherapy (43). Importantly, >90% of tumours 
carrying a mutant TP53 gene show loss of the second allele 
by mutation, chromosomal deletion or loss of heterozygosity, 
strongly supporting the tumour suppressor model (44).

The  main  genetic  alterations  of  the  TP53  gene  include 
truncating  and  splice  sites  mutations,  in-frame  insertions/
deletions (indels), frameshift indels and missense mutations 
arising from diverse mechanisms, playing specific roles in 
tumour development (45,46). Missense mutations, resulting 
in single amino acid changes, represent the vast majority of 
mutations occurring in >190 different codons of the TP53 
gene (>80%), with the highest frequency in the DNA-binding 
domain (Fig. 2). Post-translational modifications of mutant p53 
proteins, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, contribute 
to the stabilization of mutant proteins, leading to their accu‑
mulation in cancer cells (44,47). For instance, phosphorylation 
on Ser15 and Ser37 in mutant p53 has been shown to stabilise 
the protein and to enhance the oncogenic activity in ovarian 
cancer (48).

Different  missense  mutations  in  p53  may  confer  new 
biological activities to the mutant oncosuppressor, which can 
be grouped into three possible mechanisms: i) Loss of func‑
tion  (LOF)  in  transcriptional  regulation  of  p53‑dependent 
genes; ii) dominant negative effect (DNE) on the activity of 
wild‑type p53 via the formation of mixed heterotetramers; 
and iii) gain of function (GOF) in terms of oncogenic activity 
(Fig. 3) (49-52). While LOF and DNE of mutant p53 have been 
proven crucial for cell proliferation and malignant transforma‑
tion, the processes activated by mutant p53 characterised by 
GOF remain to be fully elucidated (52‑56).

Approximately 30% of missense mutations in the TP53 
gene  occur  at  six  hot  spots  and  produce  eight  diverse  p53 
mutants,  such  as  R175H,  G245S,  R248Q,  R248W,  R249S, 
R273C, R273H and R282W (57-59). These have been reported 
to possess GOF activity, although the molecular mechanisms 
behind their novel oncogenic functions have not been fully 
elucidated.  The  hot  spot  mutations  determine  amino  acid 
changes in p53 that have been classified as contact mutants, 
which occur in the DNA-binding domain (R248Q, R248W, 
R273H  and  R273C),  and  conformational  mutants,  which 
cause abnormal protein folding (R175H, G245S, R249S and 
R282H) (60,61). Contact mutants directly affect the ability of 
mutant p53 to control the transcription of target genes, while 
conformational mutants cause the loss of zinc coordination 
and DNA‑binding activity (62).

Mutant p53 has been shown to bind nuclear transcrip‑
tion factors, such as nuclear transcription factor Y (NF‑Y), 
tumour  protein  p73,  nuclear  factor  erythroid  2‑related 
factor 2 and protein C‑ets‑1, to activate the transcription 
of  their  target  genes  and  promote  malignant  transforma‑
tion by inducing overexpression of cell cycle genes (63,64). 
Complexes formed by mutant p53 and the transcriptional 
co‑regulator tyrosine‑protein kinase Yes‑associated protein 
and  the  nuclear  transcription  factor  NF‑Y  were  shown 
to  promote  the  aberrant  expression  of  cell  cycle‑related 
genes,  such  as  cyclin  A,  cyclin  B  and  cyclin‑dependent 
kinase 1 (65). In addition, mutant p53 has been shown to 
antagonise  the  tumour  suppression  activity  mediated  by 
p63/p73 via the Notch1 signalling pathway in colorectal and 
pancreatic cancers (66). The p53 mutations causing nuclear 
delocalization  are  also  involved  in  regulating  oncogenic 
activity. Indeed, in colon cancer cells, the p53 P151H and 
R282W  mutants  located  in  the  nucleus  were  shown  to 
hinder  autophagy,  while  p53  E258K,  R273H  and  R273L

Figure 1. Under physiological conditions, cell stress promotes the activation and stabilization of p53 by post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, 
acetylation, etc.). The stabilized p53 forms tetramers, which bind the p53‑dependent promoters and activate the expression of genes involved in different 
biological functions, such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis. The p53 protein directly interacts with numerous other proteins and 
regulates cellular pathways such as ferroptosis, ROS, autophagy and metabolism. The level of p53 protein is regulated by a p53-MDM2/MDMX feedback 
loop via proteasomal degradation of p53. 14-3-3-s, 14-3-3 protein sigma; ALDH4, aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1; ALOX12, arachidonate

mutant p53 to that of wild‑type p53 could be more effective 
as anticancer therapies.

A recent study by Wang et al (68) addressed the impor‑
tance of mutant p53 GOF in neoplastic transformation by 
inactivating 12 TP53 mutations in a panel of 15 human cancer 
cell  lines  derived  from  breast  cancer,  colorectal  cancer, 
lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, leukaemia, osteosar‑
coma  and  lung  cancer.  They  found  that  removing  mutant 
TP53 using an inducible clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 
(Cas9) platform neither reduced in vitro cell survival and 
proliferation, nor did it affect the killing of cancer cells in 
response to drug treatment. Furthermore, removing mutant 
p53 did not impact mitochondrial activity and intracellular 
reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  in  the  tested  cell  lines.  In 
addition, knocking out the mutant TP53 did not affect the 
local growth of tumours derived from cancer cell lines or the 
number of lung metastasis in NOD scid gamma mice (68). 
Conversely,  changing  mutant  TP53  to  wild‑type  TP53 
induced  a  reduction  in  tumour  cell  proliferation  in  vitro, 
suggesting that drugs capable of reshaping the structure of 

The clinical outcome of p53 mutations has been exten‑
sively studied, yielding sometimes divergent results (53,69). 
Early studies in patients with Li‑Fraumeni syndrome showed 
that the germline mutation p53 R248Q was associated with 
the development of cancer at a younger age compared with 
those  with  non‑mutated  TP53  (70).  Conversely,  somatic 
mutations in p53, commonly associated with a wide range of 
cancers, are more frequent in older populations (71). Overall, 
the  majority  of  studies  have  demonstrated  an  association 
between  TP53  mutations  and  more  aggressive  tumours, 
resistance to treatments and poor overall outcomes in several 
cancer types (17,72).

The chemoresistance of cancer cells to various drugs is 
strongly dependent on TP53 mutational status in numerous 
cancer types (50). Several studies have shown that mutant p53 
causes an increased expression of the multidrug resistance 1 
gene, an important regulator of the membrane pump, which 
induces chemoresistance by increasing the efflux of drugs out 
of cells (73). Conversely, depletion of mutant p53 reduces cell

resistance to cisplatin, adriamycin and etoposide in multiple 
cancer cell lines (74). Mutations in the TP53 gene identified 
in colorectal cancer have been associated with resistance to 
insulin‑like growth factor‑1 receptor inhibitors (75). In osteo‑
sarcoma, the p53 R273H mutant is associated with reduced 
expression of procaspase‑3 and failure of methotrexate and 

doxorubicin to induce apoptosis (76). In colon cancer, mutant 
p53 that fails to activate the PUMA promoter causes evasion 
from apoptosis and reduces the sensitivity of tumour cells to 
5-fluorouracil (77). Considering all these findings, it is highly 
plausible that mutant p53 plays a critical role in the chemore‑
sistance of several tumour types.

The response to radiation therapy is also influenced by the 
p53 status. A study of 60 different cancer cell lines carrying 
mutant  p53  revealed  an  inability  to  induce  key  regulatory 
genes such as CDKN1A, MDM2 and growth arrest and DNA 
damage inducible alpha (GADD45), leading to a failure in 
G1 phase arrest after gamma-irradiation  (78). This lack of 
response  resulted  in  increased  radioresistance.  Similarly, 
ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular carci‑
noma, cervical cancer and endometrial cancer cells carrying 
mutant p53 are more resistant to radiation therapy compared 
to  cells  carrying  wild-type  p53  (79).  Therefore,  additional 
research is necessary to fully characterise the relationship 
between mutant p53 and response to radiotherapy, which is 
crucial for improving patient treatment.

3. Therapeutic strategies to target mutant p53

The primary effect of p53 mutations in cancer is the loss of 
tumour suppressor function, making therapeutic reactivation 
of  p53  a  priority.  Several  therapeutic  approaches  include 
refining earlier strategies with improved understanding and 
delivery methods or utilising novel drug design techniques. 
New  strategies  encompass  gene  therapy  to  restore  normal 
p53 function, inhibition of MDM2‑p53 interaction, p53‑based 
vaccines and the use of small molecules capable of reinstating 
a  wild‑type‑like  status  of  mutant  p53.  Several  excellent 
reviews have reported state‑of‑the‑art therapeutic strategies to 
enhance wild‑type p53 activity as well as p53‑based immu‑
notherapy (80,81). The present review reassesses the progress 
in promising therapeutic strategies targeting mutant p53 for 
degradation or reinstating its wild‑type‑like conformation to 
restore its oncosuppressor activities.

Degradation of mutant p53 has emerged as a promising 
antitumour strategy. Various compounds, including gambogic 
acid (GA), capsaicin, MCB-613 and NSC59984, have demon‑
strated the ability to effectively degrade mutant p53 (82). GA 
was  reported  to  reduce  the  expression  of  MDM2,  thereby 
increasing the levels of wild‑type p53 and inhibiting tumour 
growth  (83).  Later  studies  revealed  that  GA  also  reduces 
mutant p53 levels by hindering the formation of heat shock 
protein (Hsp)90/mutant p53 complexes, leading to the ubiq‑
uitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of mutant p53 (84). 
However, GA was observed to drive other mechanisms critical 
for malignant cell death, such as the activation of the intrinsic 
apoptotic pathway in TP53-null prostate cancer cells  (85). 
Thus, GA inhibits tumour growth by activating several cell 
growth  inhibitory  pathways,  with  mutant  p53  degradation 
being one possible contributing mechanism.

Capsaicin,  the  main  bioactive  component  of  chili 
peppers,  has  been  shown  to  induce  autophagy  and  mutant 
p53 protein degradation in cells carrying mutant p53 and in 
H1299 (p53 null) overexpressing p53 R175H and p53 R273H 
mutant proteins (86). The small molecule MCB-613 has been 
demonstrated to cause fast and selective degradation of p53 
R175H protein in ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting ubiquitin 
carboxyl‑terminal hydrolase 15, enabling selective depletion 
of oncogenic p53 R175H levels  (87). In addition, the small 
molecule NSC59984 has been shown to specifically restore 
the p53 pathway through p73 and deplete mutant p53 proteins 
in colorectal cancer cells (88).

Several  drugs  effective  in  degrading  mutant  p53,  such 
as ganetespib, statins and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
(SAHA),  are  currently  under  evaluation  in  clinical  trials. 
Ganetespib is a potent Hsp90 inhibitor that has shown remark‑
able effectiveness in degrading mutant p53 and killing cancer 
cells. It has exhibited strong cytotoxic effects across various 
haematological and solid tumours and has been successful in 
inhibiting tumour growth and extending survival in mouse 
models with specific mutant p53 expressions (89). Combining 
ganetespib with chemotherapy agents such as cyclophospha‑
mide has been shown to further enhance its tumour‑suppressing 
effects (90).

It  has  been  shown  that  statins,  which  target  the  rate‑
limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibit the growth 
of cancer cells expressing mutant TP53 and increase their sensi‑
tivity to chemotherapeutics (91,92). Statins induce degradation 
of certain forms of mutant p53 through a mechanism involving 
the inhibition of mutant p53 interaction with DnaJ homolog 
subfamily A member 1, leading to E3 ubiquitin‑protein ligase 
CHIP‑mediated  degradation  while  sparing  wild‑type  p53 
and other mutants (93). However, there are conflicting results 
regarding  the  ability  of  statins  to  selectively  kill  tumour 
cells depending on the TP53 mutation status (94). Hence, the 
mechanisms by which statins kill tumour cells require further 
investigation.

Similarly  to  statins,  SAHA  targets  mutant  p53  by 
disrupting its association with Hsp90 via histone deacetylase 6 
(HDAC6) inhibition, resulting in the reactivation of degrada‑
tion pathways and exhibiting selective toxicity towards cancer 
cells harbouring mutant p53 (95). These findings underscore 
the potential of mutant p53 degradation as an effective thera‑
peutic approach against cancer. However, clinical trials are 
necessary to fully establish the safety and efficacy of these 
treatments for widespread clinical use.

Restoration of wild‑type activity by using small molecules 
capable of restoring a wild‑type‑like structure and the ability 
to promote the transcription of p53‑dependent genes or to 
inhibit the oncogenic function of GOF mutant p53 is gaining 
attention (96,97). Several compounds have been developed to 
reinstate the wild‑type‑like activity of mutant p53 (Table I). 
These  molecules  can  target  mutant  p53  and  activate  the 
transcription of p53‑dependent genes by restoring the struc‑
tural conformation of wild‑type p53. Such compounds exert 
antitumour activity, inhibiting cell proliferation and tumour 
growth (98).

Among  these,  p53  reactivation  with  induction  of 
massive apoptosis 1 (PRIMA‑1) is a low‑molecular‑weight 
compound  that  was  identified  in  2002  through  chemical 
screening  and  was  observed  to  restore  the  wild‑type  p53 
conformation  to  several  p53  mutants  (99).  PRIMA-1  and 
its methylated form, namely APR‑246, were found to delay 
tumour growth and increase apoptosis in tumour cells with 
mutant TP53 but not in those with wild‑type TP53 via reac‑
tivation of p53‑dependent target genes and induction of the 
pro‑apoptotic protein NOXA (100‑102). APR‑246, alone or 
in  combination  with  other  drugs,  is  currently  being  tested 
in phase I‑III clinical trials, including TP53‑mutant myeloid 
malignancies,  high‑grade  serous  ovarian  cancer,  oesopha‑
geal cancer and melanoma  (103-105). Two phase  I/II trials 
showed  significant  effects  when  APR‑246  was  combined

with azacitidine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) carrying p53 muta‑
tions. Azacitidine is the first Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)‑approved drug for treating MDS and the combination 
with APR‑246 demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential 
in these patients (104,105). Despite their initial specificity for 
mutant TP53, both PRIMA‑1 and APR‑246 could also induce 
autophagy in certain cancer cells independently of their TP53 
status (106). This highlights the complexity of the molecular 
mechanisms implicated in APR‑246 activity, which remain to 
be fully elucidated.

Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound 
present  at  high  levels  in  cruciferous  vegetables,  has  been 
shown  to  possess  chemotherapeutic  activity  by  targeting 
mutant TP53. Unlike APR‑246, which can restore wild‑type 
p53 function in several mutant p53 proteins, PEITC specifi‑
cally targets the mutant R175 p53, restoring wild‑type p53 
conformation and transactivation functions (107). In addition, 
PEITC exerts significant anti-cancer activity in cells with 
structural  TP53  mutants,  such  as  P223L,  but  not  in  those 
with contact TP53 mutants (108). Importantly, PEITC is able 
to reduce the quantity of mutant p53 protein post‑transcrip‑
tionally, with minimal impact on wild‑type p53 levels. This 
dual action suggests that PEITC reactivates wild‑type p53 
functions while decreasing mutant p53 protein levels (107). 
However, further research is required to validate the efficacy 

of  PEITC  and  clarify  the  critical  mechanisms  for  killing 
cancer cells.

The  small  molecule  PC14586  specifically  targets  the 
Y220C mutant. This orally bioavailable drug has achieved 
clinical  responses  in  patients  with  various  tumour  types, 
including  ovarian,  breast,  prostate,  lung  and  endometrial 
cancers.  In  patients  with  solid  tumours  carrying  the  p53 
Y220C mutation and wild‑type KRAS, the overall response 
rate was 38% (6 of 16 evaluable patients) (109). Due to these 
promising  results,  the  FDA  granted  fast‑track  designation 
of PC14586 for treating locally advanced or metastatic solid 
tumours with the p53 Y220C mutation. However, considering 
that the Y220C mutation is relatively rare, applying similar 
structure‑based approaches to other p53 mutants may prove 
significantly challenging for several tumour types.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a small molecule that can restore 
wild‑type p53 function in tumour cells expressing structural 
p53 mutants by binding to their DNA‑binding domain. This 
binding  induces  transcriptional  activities  characteristic  of 
wild‑type p53, suppressing tumour growth both in vitro and 
in vivo (110). Although ATO shows promise as a therapy for 
cancers expressing mutant p53, further studies are required to 
validate its specificity and efficiency.

Sodium stibogluconate (SSG), originally an antiparasitic 
drug, has recently been identified as a potent reactivator of 
temperature‑sensitive p53 mutants in a high‑throughput screen.

SSG works by releasing antimony ions that bind to a specific 
pocket in the mutant p53 protein, increasing its stability and 
restoring its tumour‑suppressing functions (111). It has shown 
effectiveness in rescuing 65 different p53 mutations, though 
none were hotspot mutations. Given its existing approval as 
an antiparasitic, repurposing SSG for cancer treatment is a 
cost‑effective strategy. A phase II clinical trial is underway 
for patients with specific p53 mutations in MDS or AML cells.
A  thiosemicarbazone,  namely  COTI‑2,  shows  prefer‑
ential  activity  against  p53‑mutated  cancer  cells  but  also 
affects p53‑wild‑type cells to a certain extent. In head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma, COTI‑2 demonstrated both 
p53‑dependent  and  p53‑independent  effects,  inducing  cell 
death by causing DNA damage, replication stress and activating 
p53 target genes through the p53 family member p63 (112). 
COTI‑2 has progressed to phase I clinical trials, while other 
related thiosemicarbazones targeting p53 R175H have not yet 
entered clinical trials despite promising preclinical results.

Numerous  other  compounds  targeting  mutant  p53  are 
showing promising results as anticancer agents. However, they 
have yet to be evaluated in clinical trials. These include the 
small molecule reactivation of TP53 and induction of tumour 
cell  apoptosis  (RITA),  which  was  identified  by  chemical 
screening and initially reported to inhibit the p53‑MDM2 inter‑
action, thereby activating the anti‑tumour effects of wild‑type 
p53 (113). A subsequent study revealed that RITA could also 
suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in tumour cells 
expressing mutant TP53 by restoring wild‑type p53 transcrip‑
tional activities in several hotspot p53 mutants (114). This was 
demonstrated by the expression of wild‑type p53 target genes 
such  as  GADD45,  BCL2  binding  component  3,  BAX  and 
CDKN1A in these cells. Furthermore, RITA was also shown 
to induce apoptosis in tumour cells with wild‑type p53 and also 
in TP53-deficient cancer cells, suggesting that its anticancer 
effects may not be specifically dependent on mutant p53 (115).
Similarly  to  the  above‑described  small  molecules, 
CP-31398 has been shown to restore functional activity to 
mutant p53 proteins, enabling them to exert wild‑type p53 
transcriptional activity (116). This synthetic compound induces 
cell death in a p53‑dependent manner and is effective only in 
tumour cells expressing wild‑type or mutant p53 but not in 
p53-deficient cells (117). CP-31398 increases levels of wild-type 
p53 by preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degrada‑
tion, thus promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (118). In 
addition, CP-31398 has been shown to restore wild-type p53 
function in various p53 mutants, delaying growth in hepato‑
cellular and colorectal cancer cells expressing different p53 
mutations both in vitro and in vivo (119,120). The inhibitory 
effects on cell growth are consistent across different cancer 
types carrying diverse p53 mutations. Furthermore, CP-31398 
has been shown to increase ROS production, triggering apop‑
tosis in multiple myeloma cells regardless of p53 status (121). 
Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms 
behind the restoration of p53 activity.

Several  compounds  have  been  identified  that  target 
uncommon p53 mutants or distinct groups of mutants. Among 
these, PK7088 is a small molecule that specifically binds the 
unique  surface  crevice  created  by  the  amino  acid  change 
Y220C in mutant p53, converting the mutant structure to the 
wild-type conformation (122). PK7088 restores p53-dependent 

cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p21 and NOXA 
expression, respectively.

Other  mutants  of  p53  targeted  by  specific  compounds 
include the amino acid change R175H, which causes structural 
modification of the p53 DNA-binding domain (123). The p53 
R175H is specifically targeted by the ZMC1 (NSC319726) 
molecule, which is a metal ion chelator promoting p53‑depen‑
dent  apoptosis  in  vitro  and  inducing  tumour  regression 
in vivo (124). NSC319726 selectively kills cells carrying the 
p53 R175H mutation without impacting non‑transformed cells 
or those with wild‑type p53. Related compounds like ZMC2 
and ZMC3 from the thiosemicarbazone family also induced 
a wild‑type‑like conformation of p53 R175H in vitro  (125). 
Mutant p53 can interact with various oncogenic factors, forming 
complexes that promote cancer cell growth. Compounds that 
disrupt such interactions can inhibit cancer cell proliferation 
and  induce  apoptosis.  For  instance,  molecules  that  inhibit 
the interaction between mutant p53 and its chaperone HSP90 
cause enhanced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 
of mutant p53 while promoting apoptotic pathways and the 
death of cancer cells. The HDAC inhibitor SAHA has been 
reported  to  synergise  with  the  HSP90  inhibitor  17AAG  to 
degrade  mutant  TP53,  inducing  apoptosis  and  decreasing 
tumour growth in xenografts (126). Another HDAC inhibitor, 
FK228, also inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in tumour 
cells. Unlike SAHA, which specifically kills tumours carrying 
mutant TP53, FK228 induces cell death in both mutant and 
wild-type TP53-expressing tumour cells (127-129).

Other  attractive  therapeutic  approaches  include  gene 
therapy to repair or replace the mutant TP53 gene, for example 
using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, as well as RNA interfer‑
ence  to  silence  critical  genes,  including  the  mutant  TP53 
gene that is required for tumour cell proliferation (130,131). 
Immunotherapeutic  strategies,  such  as  vaccines  targeting 
mutant p53 neoantigens, the use of bispecific antibodies and 
adoptive T‑cell therapies using engineered T‑cells that recog‑
nise mutant p53‑expressing cells also show promise for the 
treatment of p53-mutant tumours (58,80,132,133).

Small molecules that interfere with the binding of p53 to 
its negative regulator MDM2 may be effective in increasing 
the  levels  of  p53  in  tumours  carrying  the  wild‑type  TP53 
gene  (80,134).  Despite  the  promising  results  of  certain 
clinical trials of MDM2 inhibitors and mutant p53‑restoring 
compounds, none of these agents have been approved by the 
FDA.

In conclusion, targeting mutant p53 in cancer therapy is 
an  advancing  field  with  substantial  therapeutic  potential. 
Understanding  the  diverse  roles  of  mutant  p53  in  tumour 
progression and utilising emerging strategies to counteract 
its oncogenic functions are essential for developing effective 
cancer treatments.

4. Conclusions

Mutations in the TP53 gene or functional inactivation of the 
p53 protein play a crucial role in cell transformation and the 
development of cancers. Missense nucleotide changes in the 
TP53 gene are the most frequent mutations observed in human 
cancers, making mutant p53 a key target for cancer research 
and development of therapies. Most of these genetic alterations 

8

TORNESELLO:  TP53 MUTATIONS AND THERAPY

are specific to cancer histotypes (135). Targeting mutant p53 
to restore the activity of wild-type p53, by using specific drugs 
and immunotherapies, may be effective in all these cancers 
presenting a high frequency of mutations in the TP53 gene.

The screening of chemical libraries has allowed the iden‑
tification of small molecules capable of specifically binding 
to  mutant  p53,  guiding  its  folding  to  a  wild‑type‑like  p53 
and restoring tumour suppressor activity. Such therapeutic 
strategies are likely to have a significant clinical impact in the 
treatment of numerous types of human cancers characterised 
by these mutations.

Nonetheless,  important  considerations  remain  to  be 
resolved. These include questions related to the functional 
inactivation of the p53 protein mediated by viral oncoproteins 
that can bind to and degrade wild‑type p53 in tumours caused 
by infectious agents (4). The BamHI Z fragment leftward open 
reading frame 1 encoded by Epstein Barr virus, the Early 6 
protein of high‑risk human papillomavirus and the non‑struc‑
tural protein 5 of hepatitis C virus have been shown to directly 
bind to and degrade p53 (136-138). Other viruses have been 
shown to inhibit the activity of wild‑type p53 through the 
modulation of p300/ CREB-binding protein nuclear factors, 
causing a decrease in its levels in infected cells. No drugs 
have been developed to disrupt the complex formed by viral 
oncoproteins and p53.

In conclusion, therapies targeting mutant p53 offer several 
potential  advantages,  such  as  specificity  for  cancer  cells, 
thereby minimizing damage to normal cells, wide applica‑
bility given the high prevalence of p53 mutations in numerous 
tumour types, and the potential to reverse cancer progression, 
as these drugs can reinstate the normal tumour‑suppressive 
function  of  p53.  However,  only  a  small  number  of  these 
drugs have reached late‑stage clinical trials, commonly due 
to off-target effects and nonspecific toxicity, which hinder the 
evaluation of their efficacy in clinical trials. Therefore, further 
efforts are needed to achieve the goal of targeting all forms of 
p53 dysfunction with specific molecules or drugs to address 
them effectively.
