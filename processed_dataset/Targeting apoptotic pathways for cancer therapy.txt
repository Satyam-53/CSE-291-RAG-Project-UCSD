Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Dysregulation of and 
resistance to cell death are hallmarks of cancer. For over three decades, the development of therapies to promote treatment 
of cancer by inducing various cell death modalities, including apoptosis, has been a main goal of clinical oncology. Apoptosis 
pathways also interact with other signaling mechanisms, such as the p53 signaling pathway and the integrated stress 
response (ISR) pathway. In addition to agents directly targeting the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway components, anticancer 
drugs that target the p53 and ISR signaling pathways are actively being developed. In this Review, we discuss selected and 
promising anticancer therapies in various stages of development, including drug targets, mechanisms, and resistance to 
related treatments, focusing especially on B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, TRAIL analogues, DR5 antibodies, and 
strategies that target p53, mutant p53, and the ISR.

Introduction
Apoptosis  is  a  form  of  regulated  cell  death  with  a  critical  role  in 
development  and  homeostasis  (1).  Activation  of  apoptotic  path-
ways results in destruction of target cells with minimal inflamma-
tory  response  and  disruption  to  surrounding  tissue.  Preventing 
cancer  is  an  important  function  of  apoptosis  (2),  and  dysregula-
tion and evasion of apoptosis are hallmarks of cancer. Tumor cells 
employ  multiple  mechanisms  to  evade  apoptosis,  including 
expression  of  apoptosis  inhibitors  as  a  means  of  acquiring  resis-
tance  to  cancer  therapies.  Much  effort  has  gone  into  developing 
drugs to reinstate or promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Below, we 
will briefly describe the major apoptotic pathways, then highlight 
major advancements toward targeting these pathways and other 
regulators of apoptosis in cancer cells.

Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways
Two pathways are considered the major drivers of apoptosis in all 
cells: the intrinsic pathway, initiated by the formation of Bax and 
Bak pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), and the 
extrinsic pathway, triggered by death receptors (DRs) on the plas-
ma membrane (Figure 1).

Intrinsic apoptosis
In most mammalian cells, the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein 
family regulates the intrinsic pathway (Figure 1A) (3). BCL-2 fami-
ly members are characterized by the presence of up to four distinct 
segments of amino acid homology, termed BCL-2 homology (BH) 
domains. The interactions of the BCL-2 protein family are depict-
ed in detail in Figure 2A (3–8).

Extrinsic apoptosis
Perturbations of the extracellular microenvironment that trigger 
release of Fas-L, TNF, and TRAIL activate the extrinsic apoptotic 
pathway when these extracellular ligands bind to Fas, TNF recep-
tors,  and  DR4/5,  respectively.  As  ongoing  efforts  in  anticancer 
drug  discovery  and  development  continue  to  focus  on  targeting 
DR4/5, we will focus on their role in apoptosis here. The mecha-
nism of DR4/5 activation is summarized in Figure 1B (9–14).

IAPs and execution of apoptosis
Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) constitute a highly conserved fami-
ly of proteins defined by the presence of 1–3 protein motifs called 
baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs). Most BIRs form a surface hydro-
phobic  groove  that  specifically  binds  a  conserved  tetrapeptide 
motif,  called  IAP-binding  motif  (IBM),  found  in  the  active  sub-
units of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (15). Second mitochondrial activator 
of  caspase  (SMAC)  released  by  MOM  permeabilization  blocks 
IAPs  (including  XIAP)  to  promote  cell  death  (16)  (Figure  1A). 
Caspases-3,  -6,  and  -7  execute  apoptosis  via  the  proteolysis  of 
thousands of cellular proteins. The main features of cells under-
going apoptosis include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmen-
tation, membrane blebbing, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (4).

in  extrinsic  pathway  signaling.  These 
defects  include  (a)  overexpression  of 
apoptosis-inhibiting decoy receptors (e.g., 
DcR1/2),  which  compete  with  DR4/5  for 
TRAIL binding (21); (b) decreased DR4/5 
activity; and (c) death-inducing signaling 
complex  (DISC)  inhibition  by  FLICE-
like  inhibitory  protein  (c-FLIP)  (22).  For 
instance,  colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  cells 
have  decreased  activity  of  DR4/5  that 
contributes  to  their  resistance  to  apop-
tosis  (21,  23).  Decreased  expression  of 
DR4/5  seems  to  result  from  defective 
p53,  impaired  transport  from  ribosomes, 
defective redistribution of DR4/5 in lipid 
rafts  and  mutations,  epigenetic  changes 
(23, 24), or overexpression of DcR3.

Tumor  cells  can  overexpress  multi-
ple  inhibitors  of  both  apoptotic  pathways, 
including in the process of acquiring resis-
tance  to  cancer  therapy.  Upregulation  of 
the  antiapoptotic  BCL-2  family  proteins 
and  decreased  expression  of  proapoptot-
ic  proteins  are  responsible  for  cancer  cell 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. 
For example, BCL-2 gene expression is ele-
vated in over half of all cancers and XIAP 
is overexpressed in many tumors (2, 4, 17).
Recent  development  of  apoptosis- 
targeted drugs has focused on the intrin-
sic pathway, including BCL-2, MCl-1, and 
IAP  inhibitors  (25).  In  this  Review,  we 
focus  our  discussion  on  BCL-2–specif-
ic  inhibitors  due  to  the  relatively  recent 
approval  of  the  BCL-2  inhibitor  veneto-
clax by the US FDA.

Figure 1. Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. (A) Intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Upon activa-
tion, BAK and BAX undergo conformational changes and oligomerization, forming pores in the MOM 
and causing irreversible MOM permeabilization (MOMP), the critical step for intrinsic apoptosis (3), 
allowing release of cytochrome c and SMAC. Cytochrome c and dATP join APAF-1 and the initiator 
protein procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome, while SMAC interacts with IAPs (see below). Within the 
apoptosome, procaspase-9 is cleaved into active caspase-9, which cleaves and activates the apoptosis 
effector proteins caspase-3, -6, and -7 (3). (B) Extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Upon ligand binding, DR4 
and DR5 trimerize and aggregate within the cell membrane, a process known as capping. This is fol-
lowed by recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD, which has a death effector domain (DED). Initiator 
procaspase-8 and -10 also have DEDs that bind to FADD at its DED, forming the DISC. Procaspase-8 
and -10 are activated within the DISC and in turn cleave and activate executioner caspase-3, -6, and 
-7. Activation of procaspase-8/10 is negatively regulated by c-FLIP. c-FLIP competes directly with 
procaspase-8 for binding to FADD through homotypic DED interactions, thus inhibiting procaspase-8 
recruitment and activation at the DISC (9-12). Activated caspase-8 also cleaves the BH3 subfamily 
member BID to active form truncated-BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the MOM and initiates apoptosis 
through its interactions with proapoptotic effector proteins BAK and BAX. BID cleavage and trans-
location to the mitochondria link the extrinsic cell death pathway to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 
and amplify the apoptotic response. This amplification mechanism is required for effective apoptosis 
in certain cells, denoted as type II cells for their mechanism of apoptosis, in contrast with type I cells, 
which undergo extrinsic apoptosis independently of intrinsic apoptosis pathway induction (13, 14).

Targeting intrinsic apoptosis in cancer therapy
Cancer  cells  resist  apoptosis  using  a  variety  of  mechanisms. 
Defects in intrinsic pathways include the following: (a) acquiring of 
caspase gene mutations that inhibit caspase function (2); (b) over-
expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (2, 15); (c) over-
expression of IAPs (17); (d) loss and inactivation of apoptotic effec-
tors BAX and BAK (2, 18); (e) insufficient release of cytochrome c  
and mutation of lysine residues (especially K72) of cytochrome c  
that  abrogate  the  apoptosome  formation,  causing  inhibition  of

Venetoclax
BCL-2  inhibitors,  also  known  as  BH3 
mimetics, are among the frontrunners of 
agents  that  were  developed  as  a  target-
ed approach to directly alter the intrinsic 
apoptosis  pathway.  BH3  mimetics  are 
small  molecules  that  mimic  the  binding 
of  BH3-only  proteins  to  the  hydropho-
bic  pockets  within  antiapoptotic  BCL-2 
proteins.  In  2016,  venetoclax  (ABT-199) 
was the first agent targeting BCL-2 to be approved by the US FDA 
for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) harboring 17p deletion. Venetoclax binds to BCL-2, leading 
to  the  release  of  BIM,  which  in  turn  directly  activates  BAX  and 
BAK  (26–28)  (Table  1  and  Figure  2A).  In  May  2019,  venetoclax 
was approved by the FDA for the frontline treatment of patients 
with  CLL  owing  to  the  superior  efficacy  of  venetoclax  plus  the 
anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab over chlorambucil plus obinu-
tuzumab,  thus  providing  a  chemotherapy-free  option  for  CLL 

The Journal of Clinical Investigation   REVIEWFigure 2. Targets in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. (A) Interactions of the BCL-2 protein family. The multi-BH domain family members 
either suppress apoptosis (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1) or promote apoptosis (e.g., BAX, BAK), whereas the BH3-only subfamily members identified to 
date (e.g., BAD, BID, PUMA, NOXA, and BIM) function exclusively to promote cell death (3, 4) BH3-only proteins can be divided into activators or sensi-
tizers. The activators PUMA, tBID, and BIM directly activate BAK and BAX and interact with antiapoptotic proteins to promote MOMP (5, 6). In contrast, 
the sensitizers BAD and NOXA only interact with the antiapoptotic proteins and do not activate BAK and BAX (7, 8). Interactions with antiapoptotic BCL-2 
proteins and activator BH3-only proteins regulate BAK and BAX activity. (B) High-potency TRAIL receptor agonists. ABBV-621 is a hexavalent TRAIL fusion 
protein with Fc-FcγR interactions disabled by IgG Fc D297S mutation. INBRX-109 is a tetravalent DR5 agonistic antibody with Fc effector function disabled

patients (29). Venetoclax was also approved by the FDA in 2020 
for the treatment of elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard induction 
chemotherapy (i.e., >75 years old) (30, 31).

Targeting extrinsic apoptosis in cancer therapy

TRAIL analogs
TRAIL is a transmembrane trimeric glycoprotein that can be cleaved 
by metalloproteinases and released as a soluble factor (32, 33). Both 
soluble and membrane-bound forms of TRAIL can bind to DR4/5, 
triggering  the  extrinsic  apoptosis  pathway  (Figure  1A).  TRAIL  sig-
naling  selectively  induces  cancer  cell  apoptosis  without  causing 
toxicity to normal cells. Based on this unique activity profile, many 
agents targeting this pathway, including recombinant human TRAIL 
(rhTRAIL,  or  dulanermin)  and  DR4/5  agonist  antibodies  (lexatu-
mumab and conatumumab for DR5, mapatumumab for DR4), have 
been developed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo (34–37). Preclini-
cal data indicated that both classes of molecules are generally well 
tolerated,  but  ultimately,  they  showed  limited  anticancer  activity 
in  patients.  One  factor  contributing  to  limited  anticancer  activity 
is  rhTRAIL’s  very  short  half-life  in  blood,  from  0.56  to  1.02  hours 
(38,  39).  Although  rhTRAIL  induces  trimerization  (also  known  as 
lower-order trimerization) of DR4/5, its soluble form of TRAIL has 
limited capacity to induce high-order clustering of the DR trimers, 
resulting in a weak apoptotic signal (40). For DR4/5 agonist antibod-
ies, lower-order receptor trimerization is a major limitation due to 
the bivalent structure of the antibodies (40, 41).

TLY012.  Second-generation  rhTRAIL  therapeutics  were 
developed to address the clinical limitations of previous TRAIL or 
TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies. One such conjugate is TLY012, 
where  attaching  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)  to  the  N-terminus  of 
rhTRAIL increases its size, thereby reducing its clearance by renal 
filtration  (Table  1).  This  modification  prolongs  the  half-life  of 

TLY012 to 12 to 18 hours, resulting in greater antitumor effect both 
in vitro and in vivo in CRC models (42). TLY012 also had marked 
activity  against  fibrotic  cells,  characterized  by  increased  expres-
sion of DR5 (43). These results supported the orphan drug desig-
nation by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of systemic sclerosis.
Pancreatic  cancer  cells  are  notoriously  resistant  to  extrinsic 
TRAIL-induced  apoptosis  and  undergo  type  II  extrinsic  apopto-
sis  (44,  45).  TRAIL  resistance  in  pancreatic  cancer  cells  occurs 
partially  due  to  their  overexpression  of  various  IAP  family  pro-
teins (e.g., cIAP-1, XIAP, and survivin) that block the cleavage of 
caspase-3, -7, or -9 (46) (Figure 1A). cFLIP blocks TRAIL-induced 
caspase-8 activation by competing with caspase-8 for binding to 
Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (25). To this end, ONC201 
is  a  TRAIL-  and  DR5-inducing  compound  that  may  help  over-
come resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The combination of 
ONC201 and TLY012 can induce selective, synergistic apoptosis 
in  six  pancreatic  cancer  cell  lines  and  significantly  delays  tumor 
xenograft  growth  in  vivo  (47).  The  combination  of  TLY012  and 
PD-1  immune  checkpoint  inhibition  also  reduced  the  growth  of 
pancreatic tumors in vivo and promoted tumor infiltration of CD8+ 
T cells, suggesting the potential of TLY012 to enhance the effects 
of checkpoint inhibitors (48).

Eftozanermin  alfa  (ABBV-621).  In  clinical  studies  of  TRAIL 
derivatives  and  DR4/5  agonists,  overall  response  rates  did  not 
meet  the  requirements  to  pass  clinical  trials  (36,  38,  39,  49–54). 
DR4/5 agonist antibodies show potent antitumor effects in vari-
ous  tumor  xenograft  models,  but  not  in  clinical  trials.  There  are 
two reasons: (i) rhTRAIL, TRAIL derivatives, and DR4/5 agonist 
antibodies  do  not  induce  high-order  receptor  clustering,  which 
reduces apoptosis signaling; and (ii) IgG can cross-link Fc region 
of  the  antibodies  to  Fcγ  receptors  (FcγRs).  Mouse  models  have 
lower IgG levels than do cancer patients. In patients, high concen-
trations of endogenous IgG compete for FcγR binding, inhibiting 
efficient clustering of agonistic antibodies (55, 56).

To address this problem, APG350 was engineered to potent-
ly  increase  receptor  clustering  for  full  antitumor  activity  inde-
pendently  of  FcγR.  It  contains  two  single-chain  TRAIL  recep-
tor–binding  domains  (scTRAIL-RBD),  and  each  scTRAIL-RBD 
carries three binding sites for a receptor, resulting in a dimer with 
six  binding  sites  for  DR4/5  (Figure  2B).  This  structural  change 
improves  low-order  clustering  ability  and  leads  to  induction  of 
efficient  high-order  clustering  (55,  57).  Modification  of  APG350 
yielded eftozanermin alfa by introducing a mutation into the IgG1-
Fc  binding  site  and  eliminating  Fc-FcγR  interaction  (Figure  2B). 
Eftozanermin  alfa  shows  highly  specific  and  strong  binding  to 
death  receptors  and  induces  optimal  receptor  clustering,  leading 
to on-target apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Also, clinical trials show 
that eftozanermin alfa has fewer side effects and is well tolerated in 
patients with various cancers (57, 58).

In the 105 patients with advanced solid tumors who were stud-
ied, eftozanermin alfa monotherapy led to tumor responses in two 
patients with CRC and one with pancreatic cancer (58). The com-
bination  of  eftozanermin  alfa  and  venetoclax  was  investigated  in 
patients with refractory AML and showed an encouraging response 
rate of 30%, including four complete responses (58). Eftozanermin 
alfa  fully  occupies  the  binding  sites  on  the  death  receptors,  lead-
ing to enhanced cleavage of PARP and apoptosis. Importantly, the 
combination  treatment  also  induced  more  tumor  infiltration  of 
immune cells, such as CD4+ T cells, in treated tumor specimens. 
Despite  these  encouraging  results  demonstrating  target  engage-
ment and signal of clinical activity, the only active clinical trial with 
eftozanermin listed at ClincalTrials.gov is a phase II trial investi-
gating eftozanermin alfa plus bortezomib and dexamethasone for 
patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (NCT04570631) (Table 1).  

Agonistic DR5 antibodies
TAS266.  Nanobodies  are  small,  single-domain  antibody  frag-
ments  derived  from  camelids  that  have  a  high  affinity  for  their 
target antigen (59). TAS266 is an agonistic tetravalent nanobody 
targeting DR5 consisting of four identical humanized VHH anti-
body fragments connected through three linkers. TAS266 specifi-
cally binds to and activates DR5 receptors, leading to apoptosis. It 

is  more  potent  than  cross-linked  DR5 
antibodies  or  TRAIL  for  inducing  cell 
apoptosis  (41).  In  vivo,  TAS266  elicit-
ed  single-dose  tumor  regressions  in 
multiple human tumor xenograft mod-
els (59). However, in a phase I clinical 
trial,  TAS266  showed  severe  hepato-
toxicity  that  was  attributed  to  hyper-
clustering by preexisting antidrug anti-
bodies  (ADAs),  leading  to  suspension 
of the clinical trial and development of 
this drug (41).

INBRX-109.  INBRX-109  is  a  third- 
generation,  tetravalent  agonistic  anti-
body engineered to reduce the hepato-
toxicity based on a single domain anti-
body  platform  (Figure  2B).  It  consists 
of  two  identical  camelid  heavy  chain–
only antibody-binding domains target-
ing  DR5.  These  domains  are  joined  end  to  end  with  an  effector- 
silenced Fc constant domain based on human immunoglobulin G1. 
INBRX-109’s  design  eliminates  recognition  by  preexisting  ADAs 
(41). In a phase I study, INBRX-109 showed antitumor activity in 
patients  with  chondrosarcoma,  a  rare  bone  cancer,  resulting  in  a 
disease control rate of 87% among 31 patients. Two patients had 
tumor  partial  responses,  a  rare  positive  outcome  with  this  tumor 
type, which is resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and 
25 patients had stable disease (60). The treatment was well tolerat-
ed, with low grade liver-related adverse events. These results led to 
an ongoing randomized phase II trial of INBRX-109 in convention-
al  chondrosarcoma  (NCT04950075).  In  2021,  the  FDA  granted 
fast-track designation to INBRX-109 for the treatment of patients 
with unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma (Table 1).

Targeting p53 and mutant p53 in cancer therapy
p53  is  the  guardian  of  the  genome  and  an  important  upstream 
regulator of apoptosis and other key biological functions (61). The 
essential  growth-arrest  and  proapoptotic  genes  induced  by  acti-
vated p53 include CDKN1A (p21), PUMA, NOXA, BAK, apoptotic 
protease-activating  factor-1  (APAF-1),  TRAIL,  and  DR5  (62–66) 
(Figure  3).  Therefore,  p53  affects  both  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
apoptosis  pathways.  p53  is  inactivated  in  around  50%  of  human 
cancers  and  in  almost  all  tumor  cell  lines  in  culture  (67).  Two 
important mechanisms responsible for inactivation of p53 include 
mutation of the TP53 gene and negative regulation of WT p53 pro-
tein  by  MDM2.  DNA-damaging  drugs  can  potently  activate  WT 
p53;  however,  secondary  malignancies  due  to  increased  muta-
tion burden remain a substantial concern (68). Restoration of the 
p53-regulated transcriptome without DNA damage represents an 
important anticancer strategy. Approaches using this strategy can 
be  divided  into  three  categories.  The  first  approach  uses  agents 
targeting  p53-negative  regulators  to  activate  WT  p53,  such  as 
MDM2 inhibitors (69, 70). The second approach involves directly 
targeting mutant p53 by small molecules to restore its conforma-
tion and WT p53 function (71–73). The third approach is indirect 
and bypasses p53 by compounds that upregulate proapoptotic p53

Figure 3. Strategies targeting p53 and mutant p53. (A) Reactivation of mutant p53. Direct binding of a small molecule (gray boxes) to a mutant p53 pro-
motes and stabilizes WT p53 folding and conformation, leading to restoration of specific DNA binding and transcription of p53 target genes. This will induce 
tumor cell apoptosis or senescence. (B) Inhibition of MDM2. MDM2 binds to p53 directly through its N-termini and inhibits p53 function through two major 
mechanisms: (a) upon binding, MDM2 ubiquitinates p53, promoting proteasomal degradation of p53; (b) MDM2 promotes export of p53 out of the cell nucle-
us. (C) Depletion of mutant p53. Small molecules inhibit MTp53 gain-of-function and dominant-negative effects through degradation of MTp53.

targets in p53-deficient tumors via inducing the integrated stress 
response (ISR) (74, 75) or activating p73 (76).

Reactivation of suppressed WT p53
MDM2  inhibitors.  MDM2  is  a  nuclear-localized  E3  ligase,  and 
its  overexpression  is  common  in  various  cancers.  MDM2  binds 
to  and  ubiquitinates  p53,  causing  p53  proteasomal  degradation 
and  promoting  export  of  p53  out  of  the  cell  nucleus  (77).  In 
addition,  MDM2  is  a  p53  target  gene  and  inhibits  p53  activity 
through  a  feedback  mechanism  (78)  (Figure  3).  MDM2  inhibi-
tors  bind  to  the  p53-binding  pocket  in  MDM2  and  inhibit  p53/
MDM2 interaction, leading to stabilization of p53 and induction 
of p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. The first MDM2 
inhibitors identified were nutlins, including nutlin-3a and idasa-
nutlin.  Idasanutlin  clinical  trials  were  terminated  due  to  futil-
ity  (NCT03287245  and  NCT02545283).  Later,  other  classes  of 
MDM2  inhibitors  were  developed  (79),  such  as  AMG-232  (80), 
siremadlin  (81),  and  alrizomadlin  (APG-115)  (82)  (Figure  3  and 
Table  2).  In  AML  models,  APG-115  treatment  leads  to  a  reduc-
tion  in  tumor  burden  and  an  improvement  in  survival  period. 
Azacitidine,  decitabine,  and  cytarabine  can  cause  DNA  dam-
age  and  activate  p53.  Combining  APG-115  with  these  standard 
treatment  drugs  demonstrated  synergistic  effects,  which  are 
possibly due to enhanced activation of the p53/p21 pathway (83). 
A  phase  2  clinical  trial  has  been  launched  to  evaluate  APG-115 
in  combination  with  PD-1  antibody  pembrolizumab  in  patients 
with solid tumors, including those with TP53-mutant tumors (82) 
(NCT03611868).  The  clinical  trial  showed  that  side  effects  did 
not overlap between the 2 drugs, the combination was well tol-
erated in patients, and APG-115 sensitized the antitumor activity 
of  pembrolizumab.  In  September  2021,  the  FDA  granted  fast-

track designation to APG-115 for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  that  is  either  relapsed  or 
refractory to previous immunotherapy agents. Clinical trials test-
ing the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors and combination treatments 
are still ongoing, and the results are yet to be seen.

Although MDM2 is best known for its role in p53 inactivation, this 
protein also shows p53-independent functions. These include ubiq-
uitination  of  other  proteins  (including  androgen  receptor  and  tran-
scriptional factor HBP1), regulation of transcription, participation in 
DNA repair, and regulation of mitochondrial respiration (78, 84–86).

Restoration of mutant p53 function
Eprenetapopt (APR-246). While “boosting WT p53” is a good strat-
egy,  it  is  not  applicable  to  p53-mutated  and  p53-deleted  tumors. 
Approximately  50%–60%  of  human  cancers  carry  mutations  in 
the p53 gene (87). The mutations can lead to a loss of normal p53 
tumor-suppressor  functions  and  acquisition  of  new,  cancer-pro-
moting functions. These mutant p53 proteins can promote cancer 
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as contributing 
to  genetic  instability  and  drug  resistance  (87,  88).  Restoring  the 
p53 signaling pathway involves various strategies (87). Epreneta-
popt binds to a mutant p53 and induces a conformational change 
of  a  mutant  p53  protein,  leading  to  WT-p53  conformation  and 
restoring WT function to mutant p53 (87–89).

Eprenetapopt was widely investigated and advanced all the 
way  to  phase  III  trials (89–91).  Once  eprenetapopt  enters  cells, 
it  is  converted  to  the  reactive  electrophile  methylene  quinu-
clidinone (MQ), which binds covalently to the p53 core domain 
(Figure  3).  Cys277  is  a  prime  binding  site  for  MQ  in  p53  and  is 
essential  for  MQ-mediated  thermostabilization  of  R175H-  and 
R273H-mutant  p53,  converting  the  protein  to  a  WT  p53–like

conformation and exhibiting WT p53 activity. Importantly, both 
Cys124  and  Cys277  are  required  for  eprenetapopt-mediated 
R175H-mutant p53 reactivation (89–91).

In addition, eprenetapopt has been shown to have alternative 
mechanisms to induce cell death, such as eprenetapopt’s reaction 
with other thiol group–containing cellular molecules. Thus, epren-
etapopt has been reported to attach to and deplete thiol-containing 
GSH, resulting in increased ROS (92–95). The ability of epreneta-
popt to increase ROS levels may contribute to anticancer activity 
observed in WT p53 and p53-depleted cancer cells (71, 90, 96, 97). 
Along with the ability to reactivate mutant p53 and generate ROS, 
eprenetapopt exhibited potent antitumor activity in a wide range 
of preclinical cancer models in vitro and in vivo (71, 90, 96).

A  phase  Ib/II  study  of  the  combination  of  eprenetapopt  and 
AZA in 45 patients with TP53-mutant myelodysplastic syndromes 
or  AML  showed  a  favorable  toxicity  profile  and  led  to  clinical 
responses  in  71%  of  patients,  including  complete  responses  in 
44%. However, the combination of eprenetapopt plus AZA failed 
to significantly increase the rate of complete responses in a phase 
III  trial  in  TP53-mutant  myelodysplastic  syndromes,  ending  the 
clinical development of this drug (98) (Table 2).

KG13. Besides mutations on the DNA-binding domain (DBD) 
of  p53,  Y220C  is  the  most  common  cancerous  mutation  and  is 
responsible  for  approximately  100,000  cancer  cases  per  year 
worldwide (99). It creates a cavity on the surface of p53 and also 
leads to loss of DNA-binding ability at room temperature (72). The 
small molecule PhiKan083 is a lead compound that is able to insert 
into the Y220C pocket (100, 101) (Figure 2). Although the PhiKan 
compounds have demonstrated the potential to target p53 Y220C, 
none of them satisfy the potency requirements of drug candidates 
because PhiKan are reversible binding compounds (72). KG13, an 

azaindole  derivative  (72),  selectively  and  covalently  attaches  to 
the cysteine of mutant p53 Y220C. In Guiley and Shokat’s initial 
characterization  of  this  small  molecule,  KG13  restored  WT  p53 
thermal stability of the mutant p53 (Figure 3). KG13 restored p53 
Y220C DNA-binding ability and led to the expression of proapop-
totic p53 target genes, holding potential as a specific therapy for 
p53 Y220C-mutated cancers (72). 

Novel compounds causing depletion of mutant p53
Depletion of mutant p53 prevents both mutant p53 gain-of-func-
tion and dominant-negative effects. HSP90 is an ATP-dependent 
molecular chaperone that reversibly binds to and stabilizes p53. 
Ganetespib binds to the ATP-binding domain of HSP90, inhibit-
ing the ATPase activity of the HSP90 core protein (102, 103). Gan-
etespib potently inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in 
human  tumor  xenografts  in  multiple  types  of  cancer  (102–105). 
However,  these  studies  did  not  address  whether  ganetespib’s 
effects are relevant to WT or mutant p53. SAHA (vorinostat) is an 
FDA-approved inhibitor of class I, II, and IV histone deacetylas-
es  (HDACs)  and  epigenetically  regulates  the  malignant  proper-
ties of multiple cancer types (106). Mutant p53s are stabilized by 
forming an HDAC6/HSP90/mutant p53 complex in cancer cells 
(107–110) (Figure 3). Alexandrova et al. reported that genetic and 
pharmacological depletion of mutant p53 (R248Q) by ganetespib 
or  SAHA  inhibits  the  growth  of  human  breast  MDA-MB-231 
cancer  cells  in  a  mutant  p53-dependent  manner  (107–109).  In 
p53R172H/R172H  and  p53R248Q/–  mice,  ganetespib  treatment  inhibited 
tumor growth and extended survival, which was not observed in 
control  p53–/–  mice  (107).  Ganetespib  was  investigated  in  phase 
I/II  clinical  trials  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treat-
ment  of  p53-mutated  platinum-resistant  ovarian  cancers,  and  it

Figure 4. Targeting the ISR and overcoming resistance mechanisms. From top left: in the cell death pathway of the ISR, ATF4 induction can be achieved 
by eIF2α kinase activators, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and imipridones (gray boxes). ATF4 directly or indirectly through the induction of transcrip-
tional factors CHOH or ATF3 regulates the expression of proapoptotic genes, such as DR5, PUMA, NOXA and BIM, which promotes cell apoptosis (lower 
right). Resistance mechanisms include movement of the PUP-HDAC6-dynein complex to aggresome along the microtubule (upper right). The aggresome 
is ultimately degraded in lysosomes. Additionally, ER stress induced by the proteasome inhibitors can also promote HDAC4 binding to ATF4 to prevent its 
nuclear translocation and inhibit ATF4 transcriptional activity.

did not improve patient outcomes (111). Despite negative results 
in  ovarian  cancer,  the  clinical  activity  of  ganetespib  in  other 
p53-mutated tumors as monotherapy or in combination with oth-
er agents remains unknown. Zhang et al. reported that compound 
NSC59984 induces mutant p53 degradation through activation of 
MDM2 and stimulates p73 activity, leading to p73-mediated cell 
apoptosis in p53-mutated CRC cells (76) (Figure 3).

Targeting the ISR in cancer therapy
ISR  is  a  conserved  signaling  pathway  in  eukaryotic  cells  that  is 
activated  in  response  to  a  range  of  physiological  changes  and 
different pathological conditions. The ISR is triggered by eIF2α 
phosphorylation  that  is  mediated  by  the  eIF2α  kinases  PERK, 
GCN2,  HRI,  and  PKR.  The  kinases  are  activated  by  differ-
ent  stressors,  such  as  ER  stress  (PERK),  amino  acid  deficiency 
(GCN2), heme decrease (HRI), and dsRNA virus infection (PKR) 
(112).  We  will  focus  on  proteasome  inhibitors  and  imipridones, 
which  activate  PERK  and  HRI,  respectively  (Figure  4).  eIF2α 
phosphorylation  inhibits  5′-cap–dependent  protein  translation, 
which selectively activates the translation of mRNAs with uORFs 
in the 5′-UTR region, such as ATF4 (112, 113), a basic leucine zip-
per (bZIP) transcription factor belonging to the ATF/CREB fami-
ly (113). ATF4 regulates expression of its target genes to help cell 
survival  and  recovery.  Due  to  rapid  growth,  proliferation,  and 
hypoxia  in  tumor  microenvironment,  cancer  cells  often  exhibit 
an elevated ISR compared to normal cells, and its upregulation 
in  cancer  cells  contributes  to  their  survival,  growth,  and  resis-
tance to drug treatments. However, if the cellular stress is severe, 

either in intensity or in duration, ATF4 regulates the expression 
of another set of genes to execute cell death (114–116) (Figure 4).
ATF4 is a key effector of cell fate in response to the ISR. When 
ATF4 is not bound to its DNA target, it exists as a monomer (117). 
ATF4 can interact with bZIP or AP-1 transcription factors to form 
heterodimers. Transcriptional selectivity of ATF4 is modulated by 
the formation of heterodimers with CHOP or ATF3, both of which 
are transcriptional targets of ATF4. ATF4-ATF3 heterodimers reg-
ulate various cellular processes, including stress responses, apop-
tosis, and autophagy. ATF4-CHOP heterodimers mainly regulate 
apoptosis (112, 118–120). 

ATF4 regulates CHOP gene expression, which is important for 
mediating  ISR-induced  apoptosis.  CHOP  is  a  transcription  factor 
belonging  to  the  bZIP  family.  CHOP  induces  apoptosis  by  upreg-
ulating BIM, PUMA, NOXA, and DR5, affecting both the intrinsic 
and extrinsic pathways (114, 115). ATF4 itself can promote apoptosis 
by directly upregulating NOXA and PUMA expression, leading to 
cancer cell apoptosis (75, 121, 122). Also, ATF4 promotes XIAP pro-
tein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ensur-
ing apoptosis together with CHOP upregulation (123). CHOP-ATF3 
heterodimers can increase the transcription of DR5, thus promoting 
apoptosis (124). ATF4-CHOP heterodimers regulate the expression 
of proapoptotic genes such as PUMA, NOXA, and APAF1 (125, 126).

ONC201
ONC201  is  a  first-in-class  imipridone  compound  that  is  currently 
being  tested  in  clinical  trials  for  various  malignancies,  including 
leukemia, lymphoma, and colon, prostate, breast, and CNS tumors

The Journal of Clinical Investigation   REVIEW(127). The drug was originally discovered as a TRAIL-inducing com-
pound (TIC10) in a chemical library screen and was shown to inhib-
it  cancer  cell  viability  (128).  The  most  well-characterized  imipri-
dones include ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212. The clinical trials 
demonstrate that ONC201 is a well-tolerated and potent antican-
cer drug in previously treatment-resistant patients (129). ONC201 
shows potent inhibitory effects on H3K27M-mutated diffuse mid-
line glioma (DMG) (130–133). The encouraging preliminary clinical 
activity in DMG led to an ongoing international, randomized phase 
III  trial  with  ONC201  for  the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  H3 
K27M–mutant diffuse glioma following completion of radiotherapy 
(NCT05580562). Another trial is investigating ONC206 in adults 
with recurrent primary CNS tumors (NCT04732065) (Table 2).

As  mentioned  above,  ONC201  was  originally  called  TRAIL- 
inducing compound 10 (TIC10) and was later discovered to acti-
vate the ISR, causing cell death through upregulation of the TRAIL/
DR5 extrinsic pathway and ATF4 (128, 134). Studies have indicated 
multiple  pathways  as  putative  mechanisms,  including  dopamine 
receptor antagonism, activation of the TRAIL-mediated extrinsic 
pathway,  and  regulation  of  the  ISR.  Here,  we  focus  on  the  ISR- 
mediated effects of imipridones. In an effort to search for the direct 
targets of imipridones, ONC201 and ONC212 were found to act as 
potent  activators  of  caseinolytic  mitochondrial  matrix  peptidase 
proteolytic  subunit  (ClpP)  (135,  136).  ClpP  localizes  to  the  mito-
chondrial matrix and is essential for homeostasis of mitochondrial 
proteins. ClpX acts as a substrate-recognizing subunit for the ClpP 
protease, forming the ClpXP complex. This complex is essential for 
protein degradation (137) (Figure 4).

The crystal structure of the ONC201-ClpP complex indicates 
that ONC201 binds to the hydrophobic pockets between adjacent 
ClpP subunits. This binding disrupts the protein-protein interac-
tion between ClpP and ClpX and induces opening of ClpP’s axi-
al  entrance  pore,  which  is  normally  opened  by  ClpX.  ONC201 
causes ClpP’s entrance pore radius to enlarge from 12 to 17Å. As a 
result, ONC201 activates ClpP in the absence of ClpX (135, 136). 
Activated  ClpP  cleaves  many  mitochondrial  proteins,  includ-
ing  those  required  for  oxidative  phosphorylation,  resulting  in 
mitochondrial stress, leading to activation of the ISR and ATF4 
upregulation (135, 136) (Figure 4). But the mechanism connect-
ing  ClpP  activation  to  ATF4  upregulation  still  is  unknown.  The 
ONC201  analog,  ONC212,  has  a  highly  electronegative  p-CF3 
benzyl  substituent  that  extends  into  ClpP’s  apolar  pocket  and 
enhances affinity with the protease (136). That enhanced affinity 
is consistent with the observation that ONC212 is about 10-fold 
more potent than ONC201.

Imipridone  treatment  induces  gene-expression  profiles  con-
sistent  with  ISR  activation,  mainly  by  upregulating  the  expres-
sion  of  ATF4  (134)  Imipridones  trigger  typical  or  atypical  ISR, 
depending  on  cancer  cell  type.  For  example,  in  colorectal  (134), 
AML (138), and breast cancer cells (139), imipridones induce typ-
ical  ISR.  On  the  other  hand,  in  MCL  (138)  and  cutaneous  T  cell 
lymphoma (CTCL) (140), imipridones activate atypical ISR. The 
mechanisms of atypical ISR activation also remain elusive.

Bortezomib and carfilzomib
The proteasome is a large protease complex that degrades many 
cellular proteins via a ubiquitin-dependent system (141, 142). MM 

is an incurable clonal B cell malignancy characterized by the accu-
mulation of terminally differentiated, antibody-producing plasma 
cells in the bone marrow (143). Bortezomib was the first-in-class 
compound to be approved by the FDA for MM and is a cornerstone 
of antimyeloma therapy (144, 145). Carfilzomib is a second-gener-
ation proteasome inhibitor with an improved efficacy and safety 
profile compared with bortezomib (146) (Table 2).

Bortezomib  is  a  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  proteasome  with 
a  peptide-like  backbone  and  boronated  group.  In  contrast,  car-
filzomib is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor that contains an 
epoxyketone  as  an  active  group  (146).  Inhibition  of  the  protea-
some  leads  to  the  accumulation  of  polyubiquitinated  misfold-
ed or unfolded proteins (PUMUP), which leads to ER stress and 
upregulation  of  ATF4  through  the  ISR.  Thus,  ATF4-mediated 
apoptosis  is  an  important  mechanism  of  proteasome  inhibitors 
(147, 148) (Figure 4). However, acquired or secondary resistance 
consistently  emerges  in  patients  who  initially  respond  to  prote-
asome  inhibitors  (149).  Two  resistance  mechanisms  have  been 
identified  (Figure  4).  Inhibition  of  the  proteasome  promotes 
the degradation of unfolded and misfolded proteins through the 
aggresome pathway, which relieves the accumulation of unwant-
ed  proteins  and  the  ISR  (147,  150).  Polyubiquitinated  proteins 
(PUPs)  in  association  with  HDAC6  bind  to  dynein  motor  pro-
tein. The PUP-HDAC6-dynein complex moves to the aggresome 
along the microtubule. Aggresome formation ultimately induces 
autophagic  clearance,  which  terminates  in  lysosomal  degrada-
tion (147, 150). Therefore, the dual inhibition of HDAC6 and the 
proteasome  triggers  dramatic  and  prolonged  accumulation  of 
unwanted  proteins  and  induces  apoptosis  in  resistant  myeloma 
cells (RPMI-8226v10r, Kas6v10r, RPMI-LR5, and RPMI-Dox40) 
(147,  151,  152).  ER  stress  induced  by  proteasome  inhibitors  can 
also  promote  HDAC4  binding  to  ATF4  to  prevent  its  nuclear 
translocation, hence inhibiting ATF4 transcriptional activity and 
leading to cells resistant to bortezomib or carfilzomib treatments 
(152–154). Dual inhibition of HDAC4 and proteasome synergisti-
cally activates ATF4-mediated cell apoptosis (153–155).

PG3-Oc and CB002 preclinical development
The  third  approach  mentioned  above  aims  at  restoring  expres-
sion of proapoptotic p53 target genes in a p53-independent way 
in p53-deficient tumors. These approaches may be broadly appli-
cable,  as  WT  p53,  p53-deleted,  and  p53-mutated  tumors  could 
all be targeted. Compound PG3-Oc is an analogue of the natural 
product prodigiosin, and it triggers ISR and leads to activation of 
ATF4 (Figure 4). ATF4 regulates the expression of a subset of p53 
target  genes  in  p53-deficient  HCT116–/–  and  p53-mutated  HT29 
cells,  including  PUMA,  DR5,  NOXA,  and  CDKN1A  (encoding 
p21). Among them, PUMA plays an important role in mediating 
cancer cell apoptosis (75).

CB002 and its derivatives are xanthine analogs. They induce 
ISR and ATF4-mediated expression of NOXA and DR5 (Figure 4). 
NOXA  is  responsible  for  cell  apoptosis  (74).  Transcriptomic  and 
proteomic  analyses  show  that  PG3-Oc  and  CB002  upregulate 
transcriptomes  and  proteomes  that  overlap  with  the  p53  target 
gene  database.  Importantly,  the  overlapping  gene  sets  contain 
typical  p53  target  genes  that  regulate  cell  cycle  and  apoptosis  as 
mentioned above. Although p53 and ATF4 generally control dif-

The Journal of Clinical Investigation   REVIEWferent  genes,  they  converge  on  a  set  of  common  transcriptional 
targets  related  to  apoptosis.  A  recent  paper  studied  shared  gene 
targets  of  ATF4  and  p53  transcriptional  networks  (156).  Authors 
report  that  the  p53  and  ISR  pathways  converge  to  independent-
ly  regulate  common  metabolic  and  proapoptotic  genes.  They 
demonstrate  that  these  targets  require  p53  during  DNA-damage 
response,  but  not  during  the  ISR.  In  contrast,  ATF4  is  required 
during the ISR and is dispensable under p53-activating conditions 
(156). These results provide a rationale for combined treatments 
of DNA-damaging drugs or MDM2 inhibitors with ISR inducers to 
achieve synergistic antitumor effects in WT p53 tumors. Andrysik 
et  al.  reported  that  inhibition  of  the  phosphatase  PPM1D  led  to 
activation of ATF4 through ISR (157). Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of 
HIV-1 protease and a robust ISR inducer (158). PPM1D inhibitor or 
nelfinavir synergized with MDM2 inhibitors to amplify expression 
of some p53 targets and synergistically increase cell death in vitro 
and in HCT116 tumor xenografts (157).

Conclusions
Dysregulation of and resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of can-
cer cells due to mutations in the extrinsic, intrinsic, p53, and ISR 

pathways.  Targeting  these  apoptotic  pathways  is  an  intriguing 
approach  to  identifying  new  antitumor  therapies.  The  ability  to 
target and activate apoptosis in resistant tumor cells will contin-
ue to evolve in future clinical practice. The future development of 
agents that target apoptotic pathways either directly or indirectly 
through the p53 and ISR pathways could lead to disease regression 
or cures in patients with difficult-to-treat tumors.
