Abstract 
Ferroptosis, a newform of programmed cell death, driven by peroxidative damages of polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-
containing phospholipids in cellular membranes and is extremely dependent on iron ions, which is differs characteris-
tics from traditional cell death has attracted greater attention. Based on the curiosity of this new form of regulated cell 
death, there has a tremendous progress in the field of mechanistic understanding of ferroptosis recent years. Fer-
roptosis is closely associated with the development of many diseases and involved in many diseases related signaling 
pathways. Not only a variety of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors can regulate ferroptosis, but multiple oncogenic 
signaling pathways can also have a regulatory effect on ferroptosis. Ferroptosis results in the accumulation of large 
amounts of lipid peroxides thus involving the onset of oxidative stress and energy stress responses. The MAPK path-
way plays a critical role in oxidative stress and AMPK acts as a sensor of cellular energy and is involved in the regula-
tion of the energy stress response. Moreover, activation of AMPK can induce the occurrence of autophagy-dependent 
ferroptosis and p53-activated ferroptosis. In recent years, there have been new advances in the study of molecular 
mechanisms related to the regulation of ferroptosis by both pathways. In this review, we will summarize the molecular 
mechanisms by which the MAPK-AMPK signaling pathway regulates ferroptosis. Meanwhile, we sorted out the mys-
terious relationship between MAPK and AMPK, described the crosstalk among ferroptosis and MAPK-AMPK signaling 
pathways, and summarized the relevant ferroptosis inducers targeting this regulatory network. This will provide a new 
field for future research on ferroptosis mechanisms and provide a new vision for cancer treatment strategies.

Over  the  past  few  decades,  therapies  that  induce  can-
cer  cells  to  initiate  a  regulatory  cell  death  program 
have  attracted  widespread  attention.  Regulatory  cell 
death  [1]  is  a  proactive  process  and  can  occur  through 
a  range  of  molecular  mechanisms  and  signaling  path-
ways  that  mediate  it.  Since  the  discovery  of  ferroptosis 
in  2012  [2],  the  study  of  the  mechanisms  of  regulatory 
cell death modalities has once again gained new hotness.

Ferroptosis  is  a  new  form  of  regulated  cell  death,  which 
along with elevated iron ion levels and driven by peroxi-
dative damages of polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-containing 
phospholipids  in  cellular  membranes  [2–4].  Although 
ferroptosis is morphologically, biochemically and geneti-
cally different from other death programs such as apop-
tosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Yet, it was recently found 
that  the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis  is  accompanied  by 
autophagy-like  changes  so  that  is  considered  to  be  an 
autophagy-dependent  cell  death  in  a  variety  of  cells  [5]. 
The  fact  that  autophagy-related  factors  (e.g.,  BECN1, 
mTOR,  AMPK)  can  regulate  specific  regulatory  ferrop-
tosis  networks  also  provides  us  with  a  new  idea  as  to 
whether the occurrence of ferroptosis is somehow related 
to the signaling pathways that regulate autophagy.

Ferroptosis  occurs  with  the  development  of  oxidative 
stress  and  energy  stress  [6],  and  the  activity  of  cancer-
related  signaling  pathways  can  regulate  these  two  stress 
responses.  The  dysregulation  of  the  mitogen-activated 
protein  kinase  (MAPK)  and  AMP-activated  protein 
kinase  (AMPK)  pathways,  which  represent  the  regula-
tion  of  oxidative  stress  and  energy  stress,  is  critical  for 
ferroptosis.  Mitogen-activated  protein  kinases  (MAPKs) 
family which include extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
(ERK),  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinase  (JNK)  and  p38mitogen-
activated  protein  kinase  (p38  MAPK),  are  a  group  of 
signaling  molecules  that  play  a  critical  role  in  the  regu-
lation  of  cell  growth,  differentiation,  apoptosis  and  oxi-
dative  stress  response.  The  study  found  that  the  high 
ROS  environment  will  mediate  MAPK  signaling  path-
way,  inducing  ferroptosis  [7].  Aberrant  activation  of  the 
MAPK  pathway  is  prominently  implicated  in  cancer 
development and progression. The occurrence of ferrop-
tosis is accompanied by the accumulation of lipid perox-
ides,  which  can  induce  energy  stress  that  depletes  ATP 
to cause cell death. AMPK is a sensor of cellular energy 
status, affects cellular redox homeostasis and iron metab-
olism,  and  related  studies  have  found  that  promoting 
AMPK  activation  through  energy  stress  can  inhibit  fer-
roptosis [6]. Under physiological conditions, AMPK plays 
a  major  role  in  biological  processes  such  as  cell  growth, 
autophagy, and apoptosis. While it is interesting that the 
effects of AMPK activation on ferroptosis involve modu-
lation  of  autophagy,  mTORC1  signaling,  p53  activation, 
cystine  uptake,  or  iron  metabolism  which  can  induce 
ferroptosis. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated 
that inhibition of MAPK pathway activity can activate the 
LKB1-AMPK  signaling  pathway  [8]. These  intricate  net-
works make MAPK and AMPK pathways to be enigmatic 
in regulating the onset of ferroptosis.

An overview of ferroptosis
Dolma’s  et  al.  [9]  discovered  a  new  compound  eras-
tin  which  can  induce  cancer  cell  death  differently  from 
apoptosis  in  2003.  Furthermore,  in  2008,  Stockwell’s 
et al. found that this unique mode of cell death appeared 
when treating cancer cells with two compounds, erastin 
and RSLs, in a high-throughput screening study of onco-
genes  molecules  [10].  Dixon  et  al.  named  this  unique 
new  modality  of  regulated  cell  death  (RCD)  ferroptosis 
in  2012  [2],  which  is  characterized  by  the  accumulation 
of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron-depend-
ent. The morphological change is manifested with mito-
chondrial  atrophy,  cristae  disappearance  or  reduction, 
increased  membrane  density,  and  outer  membrane  rup-
ture.  Compared  to  normal  cells,  cells  in  ferroptosis  are 
much smaller, which differs from apoptosis, necrosis and 
autophagy  [2].  However,  recent  studies  have  shown  that 

under  certain  conditions,  other  forms  of  cell  death  can 
occur along with ferroptosis. In addition, various studies 
have  confirmed  the  critical  role  of  the  MAPK  signaling 
pathway  in  regulating  ferroptosis.  The  active  factors  of 
ferroptosis can affect glutathione peroxidase through dif-
ferent  pathways,  leading  to  decreased  intracellular  anti-
oxidant capacity and accumulation of lipid ROS [11].

An overview of MAPK
The  exact  mechanism  of  MAPK  pathway  regulating 
ferroptosis  has  not  been  elucidated.  Here,  we  mainly 
describe  the  molecular  mechanism  of  MAPK  signal-
ing  pathway  involved  in  iron  ion,  lipid  and  amino  acid 
metabolism to regulate ferroptosis. (Fig. 1).

As  one  of  the  highly  conserved  signaling  pathways 
involved in various biological functions, the MAPK cas-
cade plays an important part in the signaling module of 
eukaryotes  [12].  The  MAPK  kinase  kinase  (MAPKKK 
or  MEKK),  a  MAPK  kinase  (MAPKK  or  MEK),  and  a 
MAPK  (MPK)  have  constituted  a  complete  MAPK  cas-
cade. It is known that MAPK kinases can be activated by 
tandem phosphorylation of three or more protein kinases 
to  regulate  the  activity  of  transcription  factors  and  the 
expression  of  corresponding  genes,  thereby  causing  cel-
lular responses and participating in the regulation of cell 
proliferation, differentiation, transformation and apopto-
sis, and that the activation of MAPKs is closely associated 
with  various  diseases  such  as  inflammation  and  tumors 
[12].  Four  MAPK  signaling  pathways  have  been  identi-
fied in mammalian cells, including the ERK 1/2 signaling 
pathway,  the  JNK  signaling  pathway,  the  p38  signaling 
pathway and the ERK5 significant mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase pathway [13].

Related  studies  have  confirmed  that  the  MAPK  sign-
aling  pathway  plays  an  important  role  in  the  sensitivity 
of  some  cancer  cells  to  ferroptosis  [2].  RAS-RAF-MEK-
ERK  is  the  most  classical  signaling  pathway  of  MAPK. 
MEK  activity  is  one  of  the  determinants  of  ferroptosis, 
and the activation of ERK1/2 is the characteristic of fer-
roptosis.  As  an  upstream  protein  of  ERK1/2  activation 
[2],  there  is  a  complex  relationship  between  RAS  activ-
ity  and  ferroptosis.  When  examining  the  correlation 
between RAS mutation status and the potential of eras-
tin-induced  ferroptosis,  erastin  can  induce  ferroptosis 
in  RAS-activated  cancer  cell  lines,  not  RAS  wild-type 
group. Compared with BJ-TERT/LT/ST cells lacking the 
oncogene  RAS  gene,  erastin  induced  stronger  ferropto-
sis  in  HRAS-mutated  BJ-TERT/LT/ST/RASV12cells  [14]. 
Furthermore,  it  was  confirmed  that  HL-60/NRAS  Q61L 
(NRAS high expression) cells are more sensitive to eras-
tin-induced ferroptosis than HL-60 (RAS wild-type) cells 
[15]. Moreover, sensitivity to erastin-induced ferroptosis 
was  also  reduced  in  shRNA-mediated  KRAS-silenced

Calu-1 lung cancer cells, and inhibition of BRAF activity 
was also found to reduce sensitivity to erastin in BRAF-
silenced A-673 cells [16]. In addition, diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma  (DLBCL)  and  renal  cell  carcinoma  cell  lines 
(RCC)  without  mutations  in  the  RAS  signaling  pathway 
showed  a  higher  sensitivity  to  ferroptosis  [14].  These 
findings have confirmed that the activity of MAPK sign-
aling pathway can regulate ferroptosis.

MAPK regulates ferroptosis through iron ion metabolism

The metabolism of iron ions is closely related to ferrop-
tosis,  the  massive  accumulation  of  free  iron  ions  is  also 
the causative factor and manifestation of the occurrence 
of ferroptosis [2, 17]. By controlling both the input of iron 
ions  and  the  storage  capacity  of  ferritin  can  affect  the 
iron ion in a metabolic pathway, which ultimately ripples 
through the occurrence of ferroptosis [18].

The  transferrin  receptor  1  (TfR1)  acts  as  a  "trans-
port  vehicle"  for  iron  ions,  in  which  the  TF-Fe3+ 
complex  "rides"  and  binds  to  TfR1,  leading  to  ferrop-
tosis by transferring extracellular iron into the cell and 
increasing  intracellular  iron  ion  content  [19,  20].  As 
an  essential  iron  regulatory  protein,  TfR1  overexpres-
sion induces ROS generation through the Fenton reac-
tion  and  ultimately  promotes  ferroptosis  [21,  22].  A 
related study concluded that RAS activation can enrich 
the  intracellular  iron  pool  through  the  upregulation  of 
TfR1  [10].  Furthermore,  it  was  found  that  a  mitogen 
response  element  in  the  5’  untranslated  region  (UTR) 
of TfR1 mRNA, indicating that RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK 

signaling  pathway  may  upregulate  the  expression  of 
TfR1 [23, 24]. In addition, in the fibroblast-derived cell 
lines  BJ-TERT,  BJ-TERT/LT/ST,  and  BJ-TERT/LT  /ST/
RAS V12 (HRAS activated), it was found that the mRNA 
expression  of  TfR1  increased  gradually  in  these  three 
cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of TfR1 in BJ-TERT/
LT/ST/RAS  V12  cells  partially  inhibited  ferroptosis 
induced by erastin [10] Related studies have confirmed 
that  the  JNK/p38MAPK  pathway  plays  a  role  in  eras-
tin-induced  ferroptosis  in  HL-60/NRAS  Q61L  cells 
and  that  activation  of  JNK/p38MAPK,  an  upstream 
signaling  pathway  of  TfR1,  can  upregulate  the  expres-
sion level of TfR1 [25]. Moreover, during ascorbic acid 
(AA)-induced  apoptosis  in  human  gastric  cancer  cells 
AGS,  it  was  found  that  inhibition  of  p38-MAPK  could 
inhibit  the  upregulation  of  TfR1,  thus  reducing  intra-
cellular iron ion storage. This also reinforces the impor-
tant  role  of  MAPK  signaling  pathway  activity  on  TfR1 
regulation.  In  conclusion,  the  activation  of  the  MAPK 
signaling  pathway  stimulates  expression  of  TfR1,  lead-
ing to increased intracellular iron ions, ultimately lead-
ing to ferroptosis.

In addition to the TfR1-mediated iron uptake pathway, 
intracellular  iron  homeostasis  can  be  regulated  by  ferri-
tin  phagocytosis  [26].  Ferritin  consists  of  ferritin  heavy 
chain 1 (FTH1) and ferritin light chain (FTL), which are 
in  charge  of  the  storage  of  free  intracellular  iron  ions 
[27]. FTH1 can convert Fe 2+ into Fe 3+, binds to FTL to 
reduce the toxicity of intracellular Fe 2+, thus preventing 
ferroptosis to occur. Therefore, inhibiting the expression 

 Wang et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2023) 21:200 

Page 4 of 17

of  FTH1  can  effectively  induce  the  occurrence  of  fer-
roptosis  [28].  Related  studies  have  confirmed  that  over-
expression  of  nuclear  receptor  coactivator  (NCOA4) 
suppresses the expression level of FTH1, thereby enhanc-
ing the autophagic degradation of ferritin [26, 29], which 
provided a substrate for ferroptosis [30, 31]. Related stud-
ies  have  confirmed  that  over  expression  of  NCOA4  in 
PANC1  cells  inhibited  FTH1  expression,  thereby  induc-
ing  ferritin  degradation  and  ferroptosis  [26].  Therefore, 
inhibition  of  FTH1  expression  levels  can  induce  ferrop-
tosis  [32].  Meanwhile,  reduced  levels  of  FTH1  expres-
sion  were  found  in  the  RAS-mutated  BJ-TERT/LT/ST/
RAS V12 cell line, indicating that mutations in RAS can 
suppress  the  expression  of  FTH1  [10].  In  the  mecha-
nism  of  Cadmium  telluride  quantum  dots  (CdTe  QDs) 
induced inflammation in macrophages, it was found that 
the  action  of  CdTe  QDs  promoted  the  phosphorylation 
of  ERK1/2  and  the  degradation  of  FTH1  in  lysosomes, 
which in turn activated the autophagy of ferritin [33]. In 
summary,  activation  of  the  MAPK  pathway  induces  fer-
roptosis by enhancing the degradation of FTH1 and thus 
the autophagic process of ferritin.

Ferroportin1 (Fpn1) is the unique iron export protein 
that regulates intracellular iron [34]. Deficiency of Fpn1 
leads  to  the  accumulation  of  iron  in  cells,  and  excess 
iron causes Fenton reaction, which increases lipid ROS 
accumulation,  thereby  inducing  ferroptosis.  Distur-
bances  in iron  metabolism  are  typical  of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage  (ASH),  and  in  the  treatment  of  ASH  with 
oncostatin  M  (OSM,  an  iron-regulator  inducer)  it  was 
found  that  the  expression  of  hepcidin  was  increased 
and the  expression  level  of  Fpn1  was  decreased by the 
action of OSM, enhancing the sensitivity to ferroptosis 
[35].  Meanwhile,  the  study  has  found  that  the  knock-
down  of  Fpn1  could  enhance  erastin-induced  fer-
roptosis  in  neuroblastoma  [36].  Related  studies  have 
verified that activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway can 
induce  Fpn1  expression  [37].  Meanwhile,  it  was  found 
that using a MAPK inhibitor (U0126) can inhibit Fpn1 
expression in a study of fasting [38]. Therefore, inhibi-
tion  of  the  MAPK  signaling  pathway  can  reduce  the 
expression  level  of  Fpn1,  which  mediates  impaired 
iron  export  and  thus  induces  the  development  of 
ferroptosis.

MAPK regulates ferroptosis through lipid metabolism

Another  characteristic  of  ferroptosis  is  the  accumula-
tion  of  lipid  peroxides  [2].  On  the  one  hand,  ferroptosis 
is induced by the  Fe2 + dependent Fenton reaction, which 
reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate highly reactive 
hydroxyl radicals by oxidizing  Fe2+ to  Fe3+. On the other 
hand, the oxidation of free PUFA, phosphatidylethanola-
mine (PE), cardiolipin, and phosphatidylcholine through 

the  enzymatic  reactions  leads  to  the  accumulation  of 
lethal reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydro-
gen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxides which 
leads to the occurrence of ferroptosis [4, 39]. Free PUFA 
is  present  in  the  cell  membrane,  lysosome  membranes 
and  the  endoparasitic  reticulum  that  containing  arachi-
donic  acid  (AA),  epinephrine  acid  and  ω-6  fatty  acids 
which  containing  PE.  Acyl-CoA  synthetase  long-chain 
family  member  4  (ACLS4)  and  lysophosphatidylcholine 
acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) are responsible for the inte-
gration of PUFA into the cell membrane [40], which are 
two key players in the regulation of PUFA synthesis and 
remodeling  [41].  In  the  process  of  ferroptosis,  AA  can 
be  esterified  to  AA-PE  under  the  action  of  ACSL4  and 
LPCAT3,  which  is  then  oxidized  to  lipid  peroxides  by 
arachidonate  lipoxygenase  15  (ALOX15)  [41].  ALOX15- 
induced phospholipid oxidationacts as a “burning point” 
to ignite ferroptosis signals.

ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) is a fellow of the RAS 
superfamily,  which  encodes  a  small  guanine  nucleotide-
binding  protein  (GTP-binding  protein)  involved  in  the 
regulation of cancer cell invasion, metastasis and prolif-
eration  [42].  A  related  study  found  that  knockdown  of 
ARF6  in  pancreatic  cancer  cell  lines  strongly  enhanced 
the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell lines to 
RSL3-induced  ferroptosis  and  was  accompanied  by  an 
increase  in  the  protein  expression  level  of  ACSL4  [43]. 
Meanwhile,  a  negative  correlation  between  ARF6  and 
ACSL4  expression  was  also  confirmed  in  tissue  speci-
mens  from  pancreatic  cancer  patients.  Interestingly, 
although ARF6 silencing upregulated the protein level of 
ACSL4, it did not inhibit the mRNA level of ACSL4, sug-
gesting that ARF6 regulates ACSL4 by acting at the post-
translational  level  [43].  Thus,  the  RAS/MAPK  pathway 
can  induce  ferroptosis  by  enhancing  the  expression  of 
ACSL4, which in turn affects the PUFA oxidation process 
and  ultimately  leads  to  the  accumulation  of  lipid  perox-
ides.  In  addition,  the  small  scaffold  protein  Raf1  kinase 
inhibitory  protein  (RKIP1)  as  the  inhibitory  protein  of 
the Raf1 kinase cascade reaction could bind to ALOX15 
[44],  and  enhance  the  oxidation  of  AA-PE  by  ALOX15, 
thereby  promoting  lipid  peroxidation  and  ferroptosis 
[45].  Taken  together,  inhibition  of  MAPK  pathway  can 
induce  ferroptosis  by  regulating  factors  related  to  lipid 
metabolism.

MAPK regulates ferroptosis through amino acid 
metabolism

Another  characteristic  manifestation  of  ferroptosis  is 
the  impaired  synthesis  of  the  antioxidant  and  free  radi-
cal  scavenger  glutathione  (GSH)  in  vivo  [46].  The  cys-
tine/glutamate 
(system  Xc-)  maintains 
glutathione  homeostasis  by  regulating  glutathione  and 

transporter 

Wang et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2023) 21:200 

Page 5 of 17

by transporting glutamate, it is known that inhibition of 
its activity can lead to imbalance in amino acid metabo-
lism, preventing the normal entry of extracellular cystine 
into the cell, thus affecting GSH synthesis, causing inhi-
bition of GPX4 activity, reduction of cellular antioxidant 
capacity and accumulation of lipid ROS thereby inducing 
ferroptosis  [47].  System  Xc  −  is  a  disulfide-bonded  het-
erodimer  composed  of  a  non-glycosylated  light  chain 
xCT (SLC7A11) and a glycosylated heavy chain CD98hc 
(SLC3A2) [48]. We can know that transcriptional regula-
tion of light chain SLC7A11 is essential for systemic Xc- 
activity [49, 50], while heavy chain SLC3A2 is responsible 
for anchoring SLC7A11 to the cell membrane and main-
taining  the  stability  of  SLC7A11  protein  [51].  It  was 
found  that  the  inactivation  of  SLC7A11  can  induce  the 
occurrence of ferroptosis. In contrast, overexpression of 
SLC7A11  increases  the  activity  of  system   Xc−  and  pro-
motes  GSH  biosynthesis,  resulting  in  ferroptosis  resist-
ance in cancer cells [2, 52, 53].

It  was  noted  that  the  RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK  signaling 
pathway,  a  classical  signaling  pathway  of  MAPK,  can 
regulate  the  transcription  of  SLC7A11.  In  the  chimeric 
tyrosine  kinase  (3T3  EN)  transformed  3T3  KRAS  V12 
cell  line  [54,  55],  and  under  exogenous  oxidative  stress 
conditions  when  tracking  SLC7A11  expression  using 
the  system  Xc-  tracer  (18)F-5-fluoroaminosuberic  acid 
((18)F-FASu)  [56,  57],  it  was  found  that  the  expression 
and  activity  of  SLC7A11  appeared  upregulated  in  the 
3T3  KRAS  V12  cell  line  compared  to  the  normal  cell 
line  [58].  Meanwhile,  ERK  activity  was  inhibited  using 
MAPK  pathway  inhibitors,  SLC7A11  expression  levels 
were found to be reduced [58]. Taken together, activation 
of MAPK pathway can upregulate the expression level of 
SLC7A11.  More  interestingly,  gene  enrichment  analysis 
(GSEA) revealed that the regulation of SLC7A11 by RAS-
RAF-MER-ERK  acts  through  an  ERK  substrate,  Ets-1 
[58].  And  the  immunoprecipitation  (ChIP)  results  also 
validated  this  prediction.  Correlated  studies  confirmed 
that under exogenous oxidative stress conditions, endog-
enous Ets-1 regulates the expression level of SLC7A11 by 
binding through the promoter region of SLC7A11 [58]. In 
addition,  luciferase  trans-activation  assays  showed  that 
exogenous  Ets  -1  activated  the  luciferase  reporter  gene 
containing  the  SLC7A11  promoter  in  a  concentration-
dependent  manner. Thus,  Inhibition  of  MAPK  signaling 
pathway  may  inhibit  SLC7A11  expression  through  the 
action of Est1, impairs the transport activity of systemic 
 Xc−, and thus induces ferroptosis.

Other

The MAPK pathway can affect the occurrence of ferrop-
tosis by regulating the metabolism of iron ions, lipids and 

amino acids, but it can also regulate ferroptosis through 
other factors.

(HO-1), 

The  nuclear 

factor  erythrocyte-related 

factor  2 
(Nrf2)  is  the  critical  transcription  factors  of  the  anti-
oxidant  response,  prevents  lipid  peroxidation  and  fer-
roptosis  by  increasing  the  transcription  of  a  series  of 
antioxidant-responsive  genes  [59],  such  as  NAD(P)
H,  quinone  oxidoreductase  1  (NQO1),  heme  oxyge-
nase-1 
glutathioneS-transferaseA1(GSTA1), 
glutamate-cysteineligase(γGCS)  [60].  Related  studies 
have  demonstrated  that  activation  of  Nrf2/HO-1  can 
effectively  mitigate  ferroptosis,  thus  inhibition  of  the 
Nrf2/HO-1 activity can be a potential target in ferropto-
sis  [61,  62].  Keap1  is  one  of  the  major  upstream  regula-
tors  of  Nrf2  which  is  mainly  responsible  for  regulating 
the subcellular localization and homeostasis of Nrf2 [63]. 
It was found that overexpression of Keap1 can repress the 
nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 
[64]. The tight binding of Keap1 to Nrf2 prevents the acti-
vation  of  Nrf2,  while  in  the  presence  of  external  stimuli 
or oxidative stress, p62 protein accumulates on the mito-
chondrial  membrane  and  binds  to  Keap1,  p62-mediated 
Keap1 degradation to promote phosphorylation of Nrf2, 
translocate  it  into  the  nucleus,  and  then  bind  to  anti-
oxidative  stress  genetic  elements  to  resistance  ferropto-
sis  [65].  Taken  together,  inhibition  of  p62-Keap1-Nrf2 
system  may  represent  an  attractive  approach  for  induce 
ferroptosis.

Nrf2  activation  has  turned  out  to  be  regulated  by  the 
mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK), including ERK, JNK 
and  p38  MAPK  [66,  67].  Related  studies  have  demon-
strated that Nrf2 is a novel substrate for pERK and pERK 
can  directly  phosphorylate  Nrf2,  promoting  activity  and 
nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 [68]. Realgar is a traditional 
Chinese  medicine  (TCM),  which  can  induce  neuronal 
cell  damage  through  activation  of  ERK  and  p38  signal-
ing  pathways.  In  this  mechanistic  study,  it  was  found 
that  inhibition  of  the  activity  of  p38  and  ERK  signaling 
pathways resulted in enhanced binding of p62 to Keap1, 
which inhibited Nrf2 activity to some extent [69]. In the 
study of the mechanism of action of β-Phenethyl Isothio-
cyanate  (PEITC)  induces  cell  death  in  human  osteosar-
coma  through,  activation  of  MAPK  signaling  pathways, 
PEITC  decreased  p62  expression  which  promoting 
nuclear  accumulation  of  Nrf2  [70].  The  physically-made 
gold nanoparticle (GNP) can induce cytosolic Nrf2 trans-
location  into  the  nucleus,  while  the  GNP-induced  Nrf2 
activation will reduce by JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors 
[66].  Nrf2  is  phosphorylated  in  vivo  at  multiple  sites  by 
MAPKs, while it is interesting that the MAPKs does not 
affect  the  interaction  between  Nrf2  and  Keap1  in  vivo. 
However,  MAPK  regulation  of  Nrf2  is  not  achieved 
through direct phosphorylation of Nrf2, and the possible

pathway  is  through  translational  regulation  of  protein 
synthesis  of  Nrf2  [71].  In  summary,  activation  of  the 
MAPK pathway can inhibit ferroptosis by promoting the 
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

The  MAPK  signaling  pathway  can  also  regulate  fer-
roptosis by regulating voltage-dependent anion channels 
(VDAC)  between  the  mitochondria  and  the  cytoplasm 
[3]. VDAC plays an important role in mitochondrial dys-
function and accumulation of lipid peroxides [2, 16, 72]. 
In  the  quiet  state,  VDACs  are  blocked  by  tubulin,  and 
erastin can reverse the blocking of VDACs by liberating 
tubulin, thereby opening VDACs and leading to a consid-
erable accumulation of ROS. Furthermore, cells in which 
the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is activated, the open-
ing level of VDACs increases, thereby enhancing the sen-
sitivity of ferroptosis induced by erastin [16, 73].

Inhibition of MAPK induces ferroptosis 
through an intermediate bridge AMPK
As  a  widespread  energy  sensor  in  eukaryotes,  AMPK 
is  a  heterotrimeric  complex  composed  of  a  catalytic 
α  subunit  and  two  regulatory  subunits,  β  and  γ  which 
is  responsible  for  regulating  cellular  metabolism.  The 
intracellular  ADP/ATP  ratio  regulates  the  activation  of 
AMPK, ADP or AMP binds to the γ subunit and phos-
phorylates  the  threonine  (Thr)  172  residue  on  the  α 
catalytic subunit through upstream protein kinases [74]. 
Activation  of  AMPK  can  phosphorylates  downstream 
signaling factors and inactivate the ATP anabolic path-
way;  conversely,  inhibition  of  AMPK  will  activate  the 
catabolism  of  ATP  [75].  Related  studies  confirm  that 
activation of AMPK enhances GPX4-dependent ferrop-
tosis [76].

Live  kinase  B1  (LKB1)  and  Ca  (2 +)/calmodulin-
dependent  protein  kinase  kinase  2  (CAMKK2)  are  two 
crucial  upstream  kinases  for  activating  AMPK  by  phos-
phorylating the Thr172 residue of AMPK [77, 78]. LKB1 
positively regulates AMP-activated  protein  kinase. After 
forming a complex with Strad and MO25, LKB1 is trans-
located from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, regulates the 
activity  of  AMPK-related  downstream  kinases,  which 
participates in cell growth metabolism and energy regu-
lation.  Moreover,  MO25α  plays  a  key  role  in  stabilizing 
the LKB1 activation loop in a conformation required for 
phosphorylation  of  substrates  [79].  Concerning  regu-
lation  of  AMPK  by  LKB1-mediated  phosphorylation 
[80],when energy utilization changes, in other words the 
ratio  of  ATP  /ADP  or  ADP/AMP  changes,  excess  AMP 
binds  to  the  γ  -subunit  of  AMPK,  and  LKB1  activates 
AMPK  kinase  activity  by  phosphorylating  Thr-172  in 
the  α-subunit  of  AMPK  [81].  Related  studies  have  dem-
onstrated  that  the  LKB1-AMPK  pathway  has  an  impor-
tant role in promoting cellular perception of bioenergetic 

contingencies  and  adapting  to  promote  tumor  cell  sur-
vival.  LKB1  acts  as  a  critical  factor  to  activate  AMPK, 
while there is ample evidence that inhibiting the MAPK 
can  activate  the  LKB1-AMPK  signaling  pathway.  The 
study  indicated  that  ERK  and  AMPK  activities  were 
found to be negatively correlated in melanoma cells har-
boring the B-RAF V600E. The phosphorylation of LKB1 
by  ERK  and  ribosomal  protein  S6  kinase  (RSK)  which 
are  the  kinases  downstream  of  B-RAF  impairs  the  abil-
ity  of  LKB1  to  associate  with  and  phosphorylate  AMPK 
at  Thr172,  so  that  the  activation  of  AMPK  is  blocked. 
Meanwhile,  AMPK  activity  increases  when  using  MEK 
inhibitors  on  the  B-RAF-activated  melanoma  cells  [82]. 
Some experiments have shown that following the use of 
MEK inhibitors in immortalized mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (MEFs) of  LKB1+/+ and  LKB1−/−, it was found that 
MEFs of  LKB1+/+ lead to activation of AMPK, MEFs of 
 LKB1−/− did not show this phenomenon [82]. This indi-
cates  that  inhibition  of  the  MAPK  pathway  activation 
of  AMPK  is  mediated  through  LKB1.  In  the  study  on 
the  pathogenesis  of  nasopharyngeal  carcinoma  (NPC), 
it  was  found  that  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)  plays  a  vital 
role  as  the  prominent  oncogene  encoded  by  EBV,  latent 
membrane  protein  1  (LMP1),which 
inhibits  LKB1-
AMPK activity through ERK-MAPK activated by CTAR1 
domain  of  LMP1  [83].  HRAS  hyperactivation  inhibits 
the  LKB1/AMPK  pathway,  the  mutant  HRas  p.G12A 
and  p.G12S  stimulates  HRas  activation  and  inhibits  the 
expression of the AMPKα2, which in turn leads to inhi-
bition  of  AMPK  activity,  this  process  is  accompanied 
by  a  decrease  in  LKB1  protein  levels  [84].  In  summary, 
inhibiting  the  activity  of  the  MAPK  pathway  can  acti-
vate the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway, thereby induce 
ferroptosis.

AMPK induces ferroptosis through autophagy

Although  ferroptosis  has  been  defined  as  a  new  regu-
latory  cell  death  mode  different  from  apoptosis  and 
autophagy,  recent  studies  have  shown  that  activation  of 
autophagy  can  induce  ferroptosis  in  normal  and  can-
cer cells [32, 85]. Autophagy can promote ferroptosis by 
selectively  degrading  anti-ferroptosis  regulators  and  fer-
ritin  in  cancer  cells  [32].  Excessive  autophagy  can  pro-
mote ferroptosis by increasing iron ion content and lipid 
peroxide  accumulation  [86].  Autophagy  can  also  induce 
ferroptosis by regulating iron metabolism or lipid metab-
olism  through  degradation  of  GPX4,  lipid  droplets  and 
ARNTL/BMAL1  (aryl  hydrocarbon  receptor  nuclear 
translocator-like).

Inhibition  of  the  MAPK  signaling  pathway  can  acti-
vate  the  LKB1-AMPK  signaling  pathway,  then  activate 
autophagy. A related study revealed that activated AMPK 
maintains cellular amino acid homeostasis by controlling 

Wang et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2023) 21:200 

Page 7 of 17

the  mechanistic  target  of  the  central  sensor  of  cellu-
lar  amino  acids,  rapamycin  complex  1  (mTORC1)  [87]. 
While  the  mTORC1  is  composed  of  three  core  compo-
nents:  mTOR,  mLST8  (mammalian  lethal  with  SEC13 
protein  8)  and  RAPTOR  (a  mTOR-associated  regula-
tory  protein)  [88].  A  related  study  found  that  Sirtuin  3 
(SIRT3),  a  typical   NAD+-dependent  mitochondrial  pro-
tein  deacetylase,  plays  an  important  role  in  ROS  gen-
eration  and  cell  death  [89].  SIRT3  can  directly  inhibit 
the  activity  of  GPX4  to  induce  the  onset  of  ferroptosis. 
Meanwhile, when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, the 
increase  in  SIRT3  expression  level  promotes  autophagy 
through  activation  of  AMPK-mTOR  pathway,  which 
ultimately  induces  ferroptosis  in  trophoblast  cells  [90]. 
Meanwhile,  it  was  found  that  the  benzopyran  derivative 
2-imino-6-methoxy-2H-chromene-3-carbothioamide 
(IMCA)  induced  ferroptosis  in  colorectal  cancer  (CRC) 
by  activating  the  AMPK  signaling  pathway  and  inhibit-
ing the mTOR/p70S6k signaling pathway activity, down-
regulation of SLC7A11 expression and reduce of Cys and 
glutathione, ultimately leading to ROS accumulation and 
ferroptosis  [91].  Meanwhile,  we  found  that  ERK  activa-
tion  inhibited  LKB1/AMPK  activity  and  thus  increased 
mTOR  activity  by  phosphorylating  LKB1,  which  also 
demonstrated  that  LKB1/AMPK  activity  was  negatively 
correlated  with  mTOR,  in  our  study  of  the  mechanism 
of ERK-dependent myofibrillar transformation caused by 
IL11 [92]. Other related studies also confirmed the nega-
tive relationship between AMPK and mTOR [93]. It was 
found  that  when  cellular  energy  level  is  low,  the  LKB1 
phosphorylates and activates AMPK to inhibit mTORC1. 
The inhibitory effect of AMPK on mTORC1 is mediated 
by activation of mTORC1, a negative regulator of TSC2, 
or inhibition of the mTORC1 subunit RAPTOR 5 [94]. A 
related study found that sterol response element binding 
protein 1 (SREBP1), a downstream effector of mTORC1, 
has  a  regulatory  role  in  the  development  of  ferroptosis 
[95].  SREBP1  acts  as  a  transcription  factor  that  regu-
lates  the  transcription  of  several  genes  involved  in  lipid 
metabolism,  including  stearoyl-CoA  desaturase  (SCD1) 
[96].  SCD1catalyzes  the  formation  of  monounsaturated 
fatty  acids  (MUFA)  from  saturated  fatty  acids,  and  the 
production  of  MUFA  can  specifically  inhibit  the  accu-
mulation  of  lipid  ROS  on  the  plasma  membrane,  pro-
ducing  ferroptosis  resistance  [97].  Study  confirms  that 
inhibition of mTORC1 suppresses SREBP1 transcription 
and promotes ferroptosis sensitivity of cells [96]. In sum-
mary, inhibition of SREBP-SCD1 activity downstream of 
mTORC1 inhibits MUFA synthesis and thus induces fer-
roptosis.  Taken  together,  MAPK  inhibition  can  activate 
the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway and induce ferropto-
sis by inhibiting mTORC1 activity.

In  the  process  of  regulating  autophagy,  there  is  a  cru-
cial protein of vesicle formation-BECN1 [98]. As the core 
component  of  class  III  phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase 
complex I (PtdIns3K) [99], BECN1 triggers different cell 
death by cooperating with different partners, and it is also 
a factor for occurrence of ferroptosis [100]. It was found 
that in the absence of glucose, AMPK was activated, and 
phosphorylated  BECN1  at  Thr388  to  promoted  the  for-
mation  of  the  BECN1-PIK3C3  complex  in  autophagy, 
thereby  inducing  autophagy  [100].  Meanwhile,  activa-
tion  of  AMPK  promotes  phosphorylation  of  BECN1  at 
Ser90/93/96,  which  leads  to  the  binding  of  BECN1  to 
the core component of system  Xc−- SLC7A11 [101]. The 
formation  of  the  BECN1-SLC7A11  complex  blocks  the 
activity  of  system   Xc−,  which  leads  to  the  inhibition  of 
GSH synthesis and consequently the imbalance of amino 
acid metabolism, then inhibits the activity of GPX4 and 
thus  induces  ferroptosis  [100].  In  conclusion,  inhibiting 
the  MAPK  pathway  activates  the  LKB1-AMPK  signal-
ing pathway and thus promotes the binding of BECN1 to 
SLC7A11, inducing ferroptosis by blocking the activity of 
system  Xc−.

AMPK activates p53 to regulate ferroptosis

The  tumor  suppressor  protein  p53  (TP53),  plays  a  criti-
cal  role  in  the  cellular  response  to  stress,  and  different 
stress  conditions  that  cause  different  states  of  p53  can 
lead to cancer cell survival or death. AMPK, an intracel-
lular energy-sensing kinase, activates p53 through phos-
phorylation  [102],  while  AMPK  silencing  attenuates  the 
phosphorylation  level  of  p53.  In  a  study  of  the  effect  of 
aspartate  (Asp)-asparagine  (Asn)  homeostasis  on  cell 
survival status, a positive feedback loop between p53 and 
asparagine  metabolism  was  found.  p53  inhibits  ASNS 
expression by binding to the asparagine synthase (ASNS) 
gene,  decreasing  the  Asp-Asn  ratio,  and  direct  binding 
of Asp to LKB1 activates AMPK while leading to higher 
activation  of  p53  [103].  Related  studies  have  confirmed 
that LKB1 can be activated by AMPK and that sustained 
activation of AMPK can accelerate p53-dependent cellu-
lar senescence [102, 104]. While p53 has been classically 
recognized to impede cancer development by mediating 
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, new evidence 
suggests  that  p53  can  induce  ferroptosis  in  cancer  cells 
by  regulating  metabolic  activities.  Traditionally,  we  are 
familiar with the idea that ferroptosis is mainly controlled 
by  GPX4,  but  p53-mediated  ferroptosis  is  GPX4-inde-
pendent  [105,  106].  As  a  new  target  for  tumor  therapy, 
the link between p53 and ferroptosis has attracted signifi-
cant attention.

SLC7A11  is  not  only  one  of  the  critical  factors  in  the 
development of ferroptosis but also one of the targets of 
p53 [52]. Related studies demonstrated that p53 inhibits 

 Wang et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2023) 21:200 

Page 8 of 17

system   Xc−  activity  by  suppressing  the  expression  of 
key  protein  SLC7A11,  which  leading  to  impaired  cys-
tine  uptake  and  affecting  the  biosynthesis  of  GSH,  and 
inhibiting GPX4 and ultimately leading to cell ferroptosis 
[52, 107]. The study has shown that p53, a novel regula-
tor  of  histone  H2B  lysine  120  (H2Bub1),  negatively  reg-
ulates  the  level  of  (H2Bub1)  by  promoting  the  nuclear 
allosteric  site  of  ubiquitin-specific  processing  protease 
7  (USP7),H2Bub1  is  enriched  in  the  gene  regulatory 
region  of  the  SLC7A11  gene,  the  deletion  of  H2Bub1 
significantly  downregulates  the  mRNA  and  protein  lev-
els  of  SLC7A11,  which  increases  the  sensitivity  of  cells 
to  ferroptosis  [108].  Regulation  of  H2Bub1  by  p53  also 
provides us with a novel mechanism for the induction of 
ferroptosis.

Maintenance  of  normal  glutamate  transport  is  also  an 
important  mode  to  avoid  the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis. 
Glutamine  is  converted  to  glutamate  by  glutaminases 
(GLS1  and  GLS2),  which  drive  ferroptosis  through  glu-
taminolysis [20]. As a critical enzyme in converting glu-
tamine  to  glutamate,  GLS2  (glutaminase  2)  promotes 
the  production  of  glutamate  and  α-Ketoglutaric  acid  by 
regulating  glutamine  metabolism,  increasing  mitochon-
drial  oxidative  phosphorylation  and  the  generation  of 
ATP  [109].  High  concentrations  of  glutamate  inhibited 
system  Xc−, a key transport system for ferroptosis, which 
make  the  synthesis  of  glutathione  GSH  inhibited,  lead-
ing  to  a  large  accumulation  of  lipid  peroxides  and  thus 
inducing the development of ferroptosis. Related studies 
reveal  that  the  hepatocarcinogenesis  was  accompanied 
by  reduced  levels  of  GLS2  and  found  a  reduced  suscep-
tibility  to  ferroptosis  in  GLS2  knockout  cell  lines,  while 
the  overexpression  of  GLS2  enhanced  sensitivity  to  fer-
roptosis  [110].  Decreased  mRNA  and  protein  levels  of 
GLS2  were  found  in  the  WT  cell  line  of  SK  Hep1,  but 
not elevated in the p53KO cell line, giving us a hint of the 
relationship between p53 and GLS2 [110]. Related stud-
ies  has  confirmed  that  GSL2  is  a  target  of  p53-induced 
glutamine metabolism and that the GSL2 gene contains a 
binding element for functional p53 DNA in the promoter 
region,  p53  binds  to  the  GLS2  promoter  and  increases 
GLS2 expression under non-stress and stress conditions 
thereby  enhancing  mitochondrial  respiration  and  ATP 
production [109, 111]. Thus, p53 enhances the expression 
of  GLS2  and  promotes  the  conversion  of  glutamate  to 
α-ketoglutarate,  which  increases  the  production  of  lipid 
reactive oxygen species so that induce ferroptosis.

P53  can  not  only  affect  ferroptosis  by  directly  act-
ing  on  ferroptosis  key  transporter  proteins  and  con-
trolling  GSH  synthesis,  but  recently  it  was  found  that 
p53  can  also  induce  ferroptosis  by  regulating  poly-
amine  metabolism  [112].  The  presence  of  polyamines 

is  essential  for  the  growth  and  survival  of  eukaryotic 
cells.  As  a  rate-limiting  enzyme  in  the  catabolism  of 
polyamines, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 
1(SAT1) is mainly responsible for catalyzing the acety-
lation  of  spermidine  and  spermine  to  form   N1  -acetyl 
spermidine and  N1-acetyl spermine, which is eventually 
converted back to putrescine or spermidine [112]. The 
process of polyamine catabolism is closely linked to the 
stress response to ROS, the reaction between SAT1 and 
polyamine oxidase (PAO) produces  H2O2 and increases 
oxidative  stress  [113,  114].  Nutlin,  a  small  molecule 
antagonist  of  MDM2,  was  found  to  activate  p53  tran-
scription,  and  mRNA  expression  of  SAT1  was  found 
to  be  significantly  upregulated  after  using  Nutlin  on 
wild-type p53 melanoma cell line A375 [115]. Upregu-
lation of SAT1 mRNA was also observed in p53 overex-
pressing  cell  lines  [112].  Interestingly,  in  nutlin-acting 
SAT1 knockdown cell lines, the expression level of ara-
chidonic  acid  lipoxygenase  15  (ALOX15)  was  radically 
found  to  be  reduced,  suggesting  that  ALOX15  may  be 
a  downstream  effector  of  SAT1  acted  by  p53  [112].  It 
has been shown that ALOX15 acts as an "intermediate 
catalyst"  to  affect  the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis.  Free 
PUFA  is  esterified  to  AA-PE,  and  ALOX15  can  oxi-
dize  the  esterified  AA-PE  to  lipid  peroxides,  causing 
the  accumulation  of  lipid  peroxides  and  thus  inducing 
the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis  [41].  Ferroptosis  occurs 
in  response  to  dual  induction  of  SAT1  and  ROS,  and 
this  process  is  accompanied  by  increased  expression 
of  ALOX15.  In  conclusion,  the  action  of  p53  activates 
the  expression  of  SAT1  and  increases  the  expression 
of  ALOX15,  which  greatly  promotes  the  oxidation  of 
AA-PE  and  increases  the  production  of  lipid  perox-
ides which causing ferroptosis [45, 112]. The activity of 
ALOX12,  another  member  of  the  lipoxygenase  family, 
has  an  influential  role  in  the  development  of  ferrop-
tosis,  and  related  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the 
chromosomal  locus  of  the  ALOX12  gene  is  very  close 
to the p53 locus and that defects in the ALOX12 allele 
have  been  identified  in  human  cancers  [116].  U2OS 
cells  treated  with  Nutlin  and  tert-butyl  hydroperoxide 
(TBH),  which  can  produce  p53-dependent  ferroptosis, 
but this ferroptosis was suppressed in ALOX12 knock-
out U2OS cells, suggesting that ALOX12 is required for 
p53-dependentferroptosis.  ALOX12  specifically  inter-
acts  with  SLC7A11,  to  some  extent  also  showing  that 
p53 targeting of SLC7A11 induces ferroptosis depend-
ent on ALOX12. Therefore, p53 can induce ferroptosis 
by inhibiting SLC711 and dependent on ALOX12 [105]. 
Calcium non-dependent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β)-
mediated  lipid  peroxide  detoxification  was  found  to 
independently  of 
inhibit  ROS-induced 

ferroptosis

the  GPX4  pathway,  and  inhibition  of  iPLA2β  activity 
resulted in greater sensitivity of tumor cells to p53-pro-
moted ferroptosis [106]. This also suggests that iPLA2β 
as a new target for the onset of p53-induced ferroptosis  
in  cancer  cells  may  provide  a  new  entry  point  for  
cancer  therapy.  It  is  well  known  that  p53  can  induce 
the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis,  but  ferroptosis  nega-
tively  regulates  p53.  In  the  study  of  the  mechanism 
related  to  the  occurrence  of  p53-induced  ferroptosis, 
it  was  found  that  p53  can  inhibit  the  erastin-induced 
ferroptosis  by  inhibiting  the  localization  and  activity 
of  dipeptidyl  peptidase-4  (DPP4).  Meanwhile,  pro-
moting the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A) which is mediated by p53 also 
plays  an  essential  role  in  inhibiting  the  occurrence  of 
ferroptosis [117].

In  conclusion,  inhibition  of  the  MAPK  activates  the 
activity of the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway, which in 
turn activates p53 and induces ferroptosis. (Fig. 2).

Ferroptosis activator
Numerous studies have confirmed that ferroptosis is cru-
cial  in  killing  tumor  cells  and  inhibiting  tumor  growth, 
induction  of  ferroptosis  has  been  widely  recognized  as 
a  new  cancer  treatment  strategy.  Inhibiting  the  activ-
ity  of  the  MAPK  to  active  LKB1-  AMPK  can  regulate 
the occurrence of ferroptosis through multiple signaling 
pathways,  this  ferroptosis  regulatory  network  has  great 
significance  in  cancer  therapy,  especially  in  drug-resist-
ant tumors therapy. Here, we summarize some drugs that 
target this network to induce ferroptosis (Tables 1 and 2).

Drugs induce ferroptosis by inhibiting the activity 
of the MAPK signaling pathway
As  an  upstream  signaling  molecule  of  MAPK,  the  EGF 
receptor  (EGFR)  activates  the  RAS-ERK1/2  signal-
ing  pathway  [132].  EGFR  activates  the  MAPK  signaling 
pathway  through  two  "arms",  the  C-terminal  domain  of 
EGFR binds to growth factor receptor binding protein-2

Table 1  Chemical structure of some ferroptosis activators

(Grb2)  [133],  the  SH3  domain  of  Grb2  actively  binds  to 
the  proline-rich  carboxy-terminal  tail  phase  of  SOS, 
which  is  known  that  SOS  is  a  RAS  guanine  nucleotide 
exchange  factor,  and  EGFR  binds  to  SOS  by  binding  to 
Grb  [134].  GTP-RAS  recruits  RAF  kinases  to  the  mem-
brane and activates them, which activates the RAF-MEK-
ERK-MAPK  signaling  pathway  [135].  Furthermore,  it 
was  found  that  the  activation  of  EGFR  can  enhance  the 
expression  of  SLC7A11  in  glioma  cells,  thereby  enhanc-
ing the transport activity of system  Xc−, resulting in fer-
roptosis  resistance  [136].  Thus,  the  selection  of  drugs 
targeting  EGFR  can  inhibit  the  activation  of  the  MAPK 
pathway and induce cell ferroptosis.

It  was  found  that  the  anti-EGFR  antibody  cetuximab 
combined  with  β-Elemene  can  induce  iron-dependent 
ROS accumulation, GSH depletion to induce ferroptosis

mutated  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  cells  [123].  Lapa-
tinib,  a  dual  kinase  inhibitor  of  EGFR  and  HER2  [137], 
which was used in combination with Siramesine to block 
the  iron  transport  in  treating  breast  cancer  cells,  which 
leads  to  an  increase  in  ROS  and  the  occurrence  of  fer-
roptosis  [118].  The  EGFR  kinase  inhibitor-Vorinostat 
can  promote  ferroptosis  in  EGFR-mutant  lung  adeno-
carcinoma  cells  by  inhibiting  SLC7A11  expression  and 
enhancing the efficacy of ferroptosis activator [119].

Activating AMPK signaling pathway to induce ferroptosis

A  derivative  of  artemisinin,  dihydroartemisinin  (DHA), 
induces  ferroptosis  in  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML) 
cells. It was found that DHA induces autophagy by acti-
vating  AMPK  and  regulating  the  activity  of  the  mTOR/
p70S6k  signaling  pathway.  By  accelerating  the  degra-
dation  of  ferritin  and  increasing  unstable  iron  pools, 
DHA  promotes  the  accumulation  of  ROS  in  AML  cells 
and  ultimately  leads  to  ferroptosis  [121].  DHA  can  also 
induce lysosomal degradation of ferritin in an autophagy-
independent manner, thereby increasing free iron in cells 
and making cells more sensitive to ferroptosis [138].

The 

2-imino-6-methoxy-
benzopyran  derivative 
2H-chromene-3-carbothioamide  (IMCA) 
inhibits  the 
mTOR-p70S6K  signaling  pathway  by  activating  AMPK. 
By down-regulating the expression of SLC7A11, inhibit-
ing  the  activity  of  System   Xc−,  reducing  the  content  of 
cysteine and glutathione, leading to the accumulation of 
reactive oxygen species and inducing ferroptosis in colo-
rectal cancer cells [91].

Targeting system  Xc− to induce ferroptosis

Sorafenib  is  a  BRAF  inhibitor  that  targets  Raf-1  and 
B-Raf kinases, and sorafenib was found to induce ferrop-

unrelated to its RAF kinase inhibition [139]. By inhibiting 
the activity of system  Xc−, sorafenib blocks the transport 
of  cystine/glutamate,  leading  to  endoplasmic  reticulum 
stress,  impaired  GSH  synthesis,  disruption  of  intracel-
lular redox homeostasis and accumulation of lipid ROS, 
thereby inducing ferroptosis [17].

The  first  ferroptosis-specific  activator,  erastin,  was 
found  to  induce  ferroptosis  by  inhibiting  the  activity  of 
System   Xc−,  which  inhibit  GSH  synthesis  [2,  16].  It  was 
found that erastin can induce mitochondrial dysfunction 
by binding to the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion 
channel  (VDAC)  and  altering  VDAC  gating,  resulting 
in  abnormal  iron  ion  metabolism  and  ultimately  induc-
ing ferroptosis [126]. The use of erastin in vivo is limited 
due to its poor water solubility and unstable metabolism, 
but its derivatives piperazine erastin (PE) and imidazole 
ketone erastin (IKE) both induce ferroptosis by inhibiting 
the activity of System  Xc− [14, 124].

Sulfasalazine  (SAS)  is  synthesized  from  the  antibi-
otic sulfasalazine and is commonly used to treat chronic 

inflammatory  diseases  [122].  It  was  found  that  SAS 
induces ferroptosis through inhibiting the uptake of cys-
tine by System  Xc−, leading to GSH depletion [125].

Lanperisone (LP) is a modified form of tolperisone that 
can  effectively  target  Ras-mutated  tumors.  It  was  found 
that LP can induce ferroptosis by inhibiting the function 
of System  Xc− [126].

High  glutamate  concentrations  induce  ferroptosis  in 

the brain and cancer cells by inhibiting System  Xc− [2].

Ibuprofen, a clinically used NSAID, induces ferroptosis 
in glioma cells through inhibiting System Xc- activity by 
down-regulating SLC7A11 expression [127].

Targeting GPX4 to induce ferroptosis

RSL3 is a RAS lethal molecule that induces ferroptosis by 
inactivating  GPX4  which  covalently  binding  to  seleno-
cysteine at the active site of GPX4 [10, 128].

FIN56 induces post-translational degradation of GPX4 
by  relying  on  Acetyl  CoA  carboxylase,  which  decreases 
GPX4 expression and ultimately leads to cell ferroptosis. 

 Wang et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2023) 21:200

FIN56 can also activate squalene synthase (SQS), result-
ing  in  the  deletion  of  coenzyme  Q10  (coenzyme  Q10, 
CoQ10), thereby enhancing the sensitivity of cells to fer-
roptosis [14].

Targeting p53 to induce ferroptosis

Eprenetapopt (APR -246) is a p53 activator that restores 
wild-type  p53  function  in  TP53-  mutant  cells.  It  was 
found that reactivation of the mutated p53 leaded to fer-
roptosis in the clinical treatment of acute myeloid white-
head disease and various solid malignancies [129].

One  of  artemisinin’s  derivatives  is  artesunate(ART) 
can  induce  ferroptosis  in  pancreatic  ductal  adenocarci-
noma  cells  which  transformed  by  KRas,  and  the  supply 
of exogenous iron will further enhance ferroptosis which 
induced by ART [131]. Another research has found that 
ART promoted the expression and nuclear import of p53 
so  that  induces  the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis  [131].  The 
study found ART can increase the level of iron and lipid 
peroxidation products, and reduce the GSH and NADPH 
content [130]. (Fig. 3).

Conclusions and outlook
During  the  last  decade  or  so,  we  have  witnessed  the 
discovery  and  development  of  ferroptosis  and  rapid 
progress  in  its  mechanistic  understanding.  As  a  new 
potential  modality  of  programmed  cell  death,  it  shows 
great  potential  and  uniqueness  in  tumor  therapy,  and 
as  a  vast  integrator  of  biological  processes,  this  intri-
cate  web  of  relationships  encompasses  the  occurrence 
of  various  pathophysiological  processes.  The  number  of 
relevant  studies  on  ferroptosis  has  grown  exponentially, 
with  many  cancer-related  genes  and  signaling  pathways 
exerting  great  potential  in  regulating  ferroptosis,  and 

mechanistic  studies  showing  the  potential  evolutionary 
origin of ferroptosis.

There is growing evidence that ferroptosis is a complex 
network  system,  and  the  importance  of  MAPK  as  a  key 
component of most signal transduction pathways and the 
most  important  common  pathway  for  ferroptosis  can-
not be overstated. Here we enhance metabolic regulation 
with the help of LKB1 though linking MAPK to AMPK, 
followed by the effect of activating AMPK and thus p53 
and  mTORC1  signaling  to  influence  the  occurrence  of 
autophagy-dependent  ferroptosis  and  p53-activated  fer-
roptosis.  However,  in  a  mechanistic  study  in  the  pres-
ence  of  cisplatin,  we  found  that  AMPK  is  not  involved 
in  LKB1-mediated  p53  activation  and  that  there  is  also 
a  negative  regulation  of  p53  activation  through  other 
mechanisms  [140].  At  the  same  time,  but  ignoring  this 
complex  process  and  focusing  only  on  the  direct  rela-
tionship  between  LKB1-AMPK  and  ferroptosis,  AMPK 
activation by the upstream kinase LKB1 can protect cells 
from  lipid  hydroperoxide  accumulation  and  ferroptosis 
by inhibiting cellular lipid synthesis [141], which in turn 
gives  a  sense  of  contradiction  in  direction  at  the  same 
time. We can see that in this complex network of signal-
ing  pathways,  MAPK  and  AMPK  are  like  double-edged 
swords  controlling  the  direction  of  ferroptosis,  and  the 
summary of this complex network provides us with new 
ideas to study the mechanism of ferroptosis.

The existence of a complex network of MAPK-AMPK-
ferroptosis provides a new vision for tumor therapy. The 
rapid development of ferroptosis-related research makes 
ferroptosis drugs promising as a promising cancer treat-
ment,  and  the  induction  of  ferroptosis  can  also  reverse 
the phenomenon of drug resistance. We summarized var-
ious  representative  drugs  for  MAPK-AMPK-ferroptosis

regulatory network, and also summarized targeted drugs 
for  upstream  of  MAPK  and  downstream  of  AMPK.  We 
considered  that  although  inhibiting  EGFR  can  inhibit 
the  activity  of  MAPK  pathway,  the  problem  of  acquired 
drug  resistance  of  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(EGFR-TKI)  has  become  a  major  clinical  challenge,  and 
overcoming  the  occurrence  of  drug  resistance  will  also 
contribute  to  the  induction  of  ferroptosis  by  MAPK-
AMPK  network.  Ferroptosis-inducing  drugs  and  other 
small-molecule compounds have the potential to become 
the  pioneering  force  in  tumor  therapy.  However,  some 
of  the  drugs  at  this  stage  suffer  from  low  bioavailability, 
insufficient targeting and poor stability, and the potential 
applications of these drugs need to be better understood. 
Further elucidation of the mechanism of action and char-
acteristics of drugs targeting this regulatory network will 
have a profound impact on tumor therapy.

In conclusion, ferroptosis is like a compass in the desert 
that  can  show  us  the  right  path  to  the  end  of  the  road, 
and  the  complex  mechanisms  involved  in  deciphering 
these mechanisms are particularly important because of 
their uncertainty, and the discovery of these mechanisms 
will  lead  to  appropriate  and  targeted  therapeutic  strate-
gies. There is a long road ahead in the study of ferroptosis 
mechanisms, and these studies will eventually shed light 
on the unique significance of ferroptosis in nature.
