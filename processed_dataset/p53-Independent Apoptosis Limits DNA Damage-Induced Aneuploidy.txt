ABSTRACT
DNA damage or unprotected telomeres can trigger apoptosis via signaling pathways that directly sense
abnormal DNA structures and activate the p53 transcription factor. We describe a p53-independent
mechanism that acts in parallel to the canonical DNA damage response pathway in Drosophila to induce
apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Following recovery from damage-induced cell cycle arrest,
p53 mutant cells activate the JNK pathway and expression of the pro-apoptotic gene hid. Mutations in grp,
a cell cycle checkpoint gene, and puc, a negative regulator of the JNK pathway, sensitize p53 mutant cells to
ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis. Induction of chromosome aberrations by DNA damage generates
cells with segmental aneuploidy and heterozygous for mutations in ribosomal protein genes. p53-
independent apoptosis limits the formation of these aneuploid cells following DNA damage. We propose
that reduced copy number of haploinsufﬁcient genes following chromosome damage activates apoptosis
and helps maintain genomic integrity.

EUKARYOTIC cells employ diverse mechanisms to

preserve the structure and function of
their
genome following chromosome damage. Unicellular
organisms rely on DNA repair systems and cell cycle
arrest to prevent propagation of genome damage, while
multicellular organisms can also activate programmed
cell death pathways to eliminate cells following damage
(Sancar et al. 2004; Roos and Kaina 2006; Bartek and
Lukas 2007; Harper and Elledge 2007). In response
to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs),
the Mre11,
Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN) complex helps process the
damage and activates the ATM and ATR kinases. ATM
and ATR phosphorylate many substrates including the
downstream kinases Chk1 and Chk2, which regulate
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The p53 transcription
factor plays an evolutionarily conserved role, connect-
ing the DNA damage signaling pathway to the core
apoptotic machinery (Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2006;
Helton and Chen 2007). Mammalian p53 is directly
phosphorylated by ATM and Chk2 and activates many
targets genes
including pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members and the cell cycle regulator p21 (Riley et al.
2008). The p53 paralogs p63 and p73 also contribute to
p53-dependent apoptosis by helping p53 bind the
promoters of pro-apoptotic genes in some, but not all
cell types (Flores et al. 2002; Senoo et al. 2004).

While p53 is required for normal induction of cell
death following DNA damage, p53-independent mech-
anisms can also activate a reduced or delayed response
( Yuan et al. 1999; Irwin et al. 2003; Urist et al. 2004;
Ozaki and Nakagawara 2005; reviewed in Roos and
Kaina 2006). Several studies have demonstrated that
p53-independent death can be enhanced by inactivat-
ing checkpoints that block cell cycle progression in the
presence of unrepaired DNA damage. In one example,
cancer cells lacking p53 required ATM, ATR, Chk1, and
p38MAPK/MK2 signaling for cell cycle arrest; loss of
this response led to caspase-3 activation and mitotic
catastrophe following DNA damage (Reinhardt et al.
2007). In another case, zebraﬁsh embryos lacking p53
and Chk1 function required ATM and ATR to activate
an unusual apoptotic response requiring caspase-2, but
not caspase-9 or caspase-3 (Sidi et al. 2008).

In Drosophila, rapid induction of apoptosis by
ionizing radiation (IR) or unprotected telomeres re-
quires homologs of ATM, Chk2 (TEFU, MNK, respec-
tively), and p53 (Brodsky et al. 2000a, 2004; Ollmann
et al. 2000; Xu et al. 2001; Peters et al. 2002; Oikemus
et al. 2004; Silva et al. 2004; Song et al. 2004). G2 arrest
requires ATR, ATRIP, and Chk1 (MEI-41, MUS304, and
GRP, respectively) (Hari et al. 1995; Fogarty et al. 1997;
Brodsky et al. 2000b, 2004; De Vries et al. 2005).
Transcriptional targets of p53 include the pro-apoptotic
genes reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid), and sickle
(skl ) (Brodsky et al. 2000a, 2004; Christich et al. 2002;
Akdemir et al. 2007). hid is essential for the rapid
induction of apoptosis, while rpr may play a less signiﬁcant
role (Brodsky et al. 2004; Moon et al. 2008). rpr, hid, and

424

skl encode proteins that induce apoptosis by directly
binding and inhibiting DIAP1, leading to activation
of an initiator caspase, Dronc, and effector caspases
(Bergmann et al. 2003; Chew et al. 2004; Daish et al.
2004; Waldhuber et al. 2005; Kondo et al. 2006; Xu et al.
2006; Steller 2008). Regulation of mitochondrial ultra-
structure by HID and RPR may also help induce cell
death after DNA damage (Holley et al. 2002; Olson et al.
2003; Abdelwahid et al. 2007; Goyal et al. 2007).

While rapid induction of apoptosis following IR
requires Drosophila p53, there is also p53-independent
apoptosis following chromosome damage. Mutations in
the Drosophila ATM/ATR/MRN damage signaling
pathways lead to loss of telomere protection and high
levels of spontaneous apoptosis (Bi et al. 2004, 2005;
Ciapponi et al. 2004, 2006; Oikemus et al. 2004, 2006).
The apoptosis induced by unprotected telomeres is only
partly suppressed by loss of p53 or MNK (Oikemus et al.
2004, 2006). No additional p53 family members con-
tribute to this response since Drosophila has only a
single p53 homolog. Similarly, in the absence of p53, a
delayed or reduced induction of apoptosis is observed
following IR or telomere loss (Wichmann et al. 2006;
Titen and Golic 2008). Double-mutant combinations
of tefu, mus304, and nbs also exhibit spontaneous apo-
ptosis, suggesting that the activation of apoptosis by
chromosome damage is independent of the central
upstream components of the DNA damage response
pathway (Oikemus et al. 2006).

Here, we characterize the regulation and function of
p53-independent apoptosis following IR. We show that
p53-independent apoptosis requires hid, which is a
target of IR-induced JNK signaling. Mutations in grp or
the JNK phosphatase puc sensitize p53 mutant cells to
IR-induced apoptosis, suggesting that cell cycle pro-
gression and JNK signaling are critical for this response.
We ﬁnd that this response acts to maintain genomic
stability by reducing the number of aneuploid adult
cells induced by IR. We propose that activation of JNK
and HID in response to aneuploidy induces p53-
independent apoptosis following IR.

Analysis of X-irradiation-induced changes in apoptosis, cell
cycle, and gene expression: For 4- and 8-hr time points,

wandering third instar larvae were mock treated or X-irradiated
with 4000 rad using a Faxitron RX650 X-ray cabinet system
(Faxitron X-ray Corporation). For 12-, 16-, and 24-hr time
points, larvae were treated as early third instar in Drosophila
media and dissected as wandering third instar larvae.

Immunostaining and acridine orange staining were largely
performed as described previously (Abrams et al. 1993;
Brodsky et al. 2000b; Oikemus et al. 2004). Imaginal wing
discs from wandering third instar larvae were dissected in 13
PBS and ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room
temperature. Samples were washed in 250 ml of PBS 1 0.3%
Triton X-100 ﬁve times for 5 min each and incubated in
blocking solution (PBS 1 0.3% Triton X-100 1 5% normal
goat serum) for 1 hr. Samples were incubated in primary
antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4(cid:3). The
posterior expression domain in en-Gal4 experiments was
marked by expression of endogenous En protein. Primary
antibodies were used at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:100; mouse
anti-phospho-H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:500; mouse
anti-Beta-Gal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000; mouse anti-
EN (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University
of Iowa, DSHB), 1:10; mouse anti-WG (DSHB), 1:50; mouse
anti-PTC (DSHB), 1:100; and guinea pig anti-HID (Ryoo et al.
2004) (gift from Hyung Don Ryoo, New York University
Medical Center), 1:500. Following primary antibody incuba-
tion, samples were washed ﬁve times for 5 min each and
incubated with secondary antibody in blocking solution for
2 hr at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were used at
the following dilutions: anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR), 1:2000; anti-rabbit Alexa 555 (Molecu-
lar Probes), 1:2000; anti-guinea pig Alexa 488 (Molecular
Probes), 1:2000; anti-mouse FITC ( Jackson Laboratories, for
staining with anti-phospho-histone H3 primary), 1:250; and
anti-mouse Cy5 ( Jackson Laboratories), 1:250. Imaginal wing
discs were stained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-
game, CA). Wide ﬁeld images of wing discs were acquired
with a Zeiss Axioplan ﬂuorescence microscope, an ORCA-ER
digital camera (Hamamatsu), and Axiovision 4.5 software.
Confocal images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal
microscope. At least ﬁve wing discs were scored for each
genotype and time point.

Quantitative analysis of cleaved-caspase staining: A confo-
cal z-series was taken through the entire disc at intervals of
1.42 mm with a 203 objective. A three-dimensional recon-
struction was generated using Imaris image analysis software
(version 5.0.1, Bitplane). A high-intensity threshold was used
to create isosurfaces of regions that stained positive for cleaved
caspase-3. A low-intensity threshold was used to create an
isosurface of the background staining observed throughout
the entire disc. Examples of a maximum-intensity projection,
low-threshold isosurface, and high-threshold isosurface are
shown in Figure 1E. The anti-caspase-3 index is the total
volume of high-intensity isosurfaces divided by the volume of
the low-intensity isosurface. P-values were calculated with a
two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Minute assay: Newly laid eggs were collected for 48 hr. Seven
days later, larvae were X-irradiated with 0, 500, 1000, or 2000
rad at two different stages, either wandering late third instar or
second to early third instar larvae still in the media. Late third
instar larvae were transferred to new vials following IR. For
larvae irradiated in the media, wandering third instar larvae
were picked out of the vials over the next 48 hr. After 1 week,
the numbers of normal and Minute bristles were scored in the
resulting adults as previously described (Brodsky et al.
2000b). For each genotype and treatment, bristle phenotypes
were scored in at least 60 ﬂies unless otherwise noted. Data

mwh assay: Wandering third instar larvae were irradiated
with 0, 250, or 1000 rad and transferred to new vials. After
1 week, adult wings were mounted in 1:1 methyl salicylate/
Canada balsam (Sigma, St. Louis) and individual cells were
scored for the mwh(cid:2)/(cid:2) phenotype (Brodsky et al. 2000b). For
each genotype and dose, ﬁve wings were scored. P-values were
calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t-test.

RESULTS

p53-independent apoptosis requires the pro-apoptotic
gene hid and the apical caspase gene dronc: Cell death in
Drosophila wing discs was examined following X-irradi-
ation of third instar larvae. At least ﬁve discs were
examined for every genotype and time point shown.
Mutant alleles are described in materials and methods.
Four hours after irradiation, high levels of apoptosis are
induced in wild-type discs (Figure 1A; Figure S1A and
Figure S2A). p53 or mnk mutant discs exhibit no change
at 4 hr, but a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis between 16
and 24 hr (Figure 1, B and F; Figure S2, B and C). A
previous study indicated that one or more of the pro-
apoptotic genes in the Df(3L)H99 region are likely to
contribute to p53-independent apoptosis following IR
(Wichmann et al. 2006). In hid single-mutant discs,
apoptosis is blocked at 4–8 hr following IR and is reduced
at later time points (Figure 1, A and C; Figure S2, A and
F). Twenty-four hours following IR, hid, p53 double-
mutant discs exhibit a 7- and an 11-fold reduction in
the caspase staining compared to p53 or hid single-
mutant discs (Figure 1, B–F), demonstrating that hid

contributes to p53-independent apoptosis following IR
(Figure 1, B–F).

All IR-induced acridine orange and anti-C3 staining
was blocked at both early and late time points in wing
discs mutant for the caspase-9 homolog dronc (Figure
S1B and Figure S2D), indicating that dronc is required
for both p53-dependent and p53-independent apopto-
sis. Similarly,
in discs expressing the anti-apoptotic
baculovirus protein p35, which inhibits the effector
caspases Drice and DCP-1 (Xue and Horvitz 1995;
Kondo et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006; Baum et al. 2007;
Lannan et al. 2007), no acridine orange staining was
observed at any time point (Figure S2E). Because p35
inhibits effector caspase activity after proteolytic cleav-
age, cleaved caspase-3 staining can still be observed once
these caspases are activated ( Yuet al. 2002). When p35 is
expressed in the posterior half of wild-type or p53
mutant wing discs, IR-induced caspase staining is in-
duced in both halves, but the staining is delayed in the
p35-expressing region (Figure S1, C and D).

Induction of HID by IR was examined in p53 mutant
discs expressing p35, which allows HID to accumulate
without causing cell death. HID induction is observed
16 and 24 hr following irradiation of p53 mutant cells
expressing p35 (Figure 2A, posterior cells). Overall, our
analysis of hid and caspase function indicates that p53-
independent apoptosis following IR utilizes the same
core apoptotic machinery activated in response to most
developmental and cell stress signals in Drosophila.

pathway: Following IR, JNK signaling is activated in a

reduces induction of apoptosis (McEwen and Peifer
2005). The Drosophila JNK signaling pathway also
regulates apoptosis in response to other cellular stresses,
including UV irradiation ( Jassim et al. 2003; Luo et al.
2007), abnormal expression patterns of the DPP or WG
morphogens (Adachi-Yamada et al. 1999; Adachi-
Yamada and O’Connor 2002), or reduced dosage of
ribosomal protein genes (Moreno et al. 2002).

The role of JNK signaling in p53-independent in-
duction of HID by IR was examined using puc, a JNK
target gene encoding a JNK phosphatase. puc acts in a
negative feedback loop to limit JNK signaling and can
be used to efﬁciently block JNK activity when overex-
pressed in a speciﬁc cell type or region (Martin-
Blanco et al. 1998). puc overexpression in p53 mutant
discs reduced HID induction after IR (compare poste-
rior compartments in Figure 2, A and B). puc over-
expression also reduces anti-C3 staining following IR
(Figure 2, C and D); the ratio of posterior to anterior
anti-C3 staining is 1.4 in p53 mutant discs and is reduced
to 0.3 in p53 mutant discs overexpressing puc in the
posterior. The incomplete inhibition of apoptosis in

these discs may indicate that a JNK-independent path-
way also contributes to this response.

A puc-lacZ reporter, puc A29, was used to monitor JNK
signaling in irradiated discs (Martin-Blanco et al.
1998; Kanda and Miura 2004). As previously reported
(McEwen and Peifer 2005), p53-dependent expression
of the puc reporter is observed 4 hr following IR (data
not shown). However, p53 mutant discs begin express-
ing the reporter at later time points following IR (Figure
3A). In irradiated p53 mutant wing discs expressing p35,
HID and the puc reporter are expressed in an over-
lapping set of cells (Figure 2E).

Cells heterozygous for puc mutations exhibit hyper-
activation of the JNK pathway (Martin-Blanco et al.
1998), indicating that puc gene dosage is rate limiting
for JNK activity. If the level of JNK activation determines
the amount of p53-independent apoptosis, then p53
mutant discs heterozygous for puc mutations should
exhibit increased apoptosis following irradiation. At 16
and 24 hr after IR, there is a 3- and 4-fold increase in
caspase staining in p53 mutant discs that are also
heterozygous for puc compared to p53 single-mutant

discs (Figure 3, C, D, and F). The overall correlation of
puc expression levels and apoptosis suggests that the
JNK pathway helps regulate p53-independent apoptosis
following IR.

Drosophila Chk1 is a negative regulator of p53-
independent apoptosis following IR: The induction of
p53-independent apoptosis following IR correlates with
cell cycle progression. IR-induced G2 delay in the wing
disc lasts up to 8 hr and requires the Drosophila chk1
kinase homolog grp (Fogarty et al. 1997; Brodsky et al.
2000a), even in the absence of p53 or MNK function
(Figure 4, A–D). While IR-induced apoptosis in wild-
type discs begins during the cell cycle arrest period
(within 3–4 hr), apoptosis in p53 mutant discs is largely
observed after mitosis has resumed. In grp p53 double-
mutant discs, which fail to arrest in G2, increased levels
of apoptosis are observed at 12 and 16 hr compared to
p53 single-mutant discs (Figure 4, E, F, and I). Similarly,
apoptosis is increased in grp mnk double-mutant wing
discs compared to mnk single-mutant discs (Figure 4, G,
H, and J). Previous studies have established that
mutations in mnk and grp do not affect the frequency
of chromosome breaks following IR ( Jaklevic and Su
2004; Oikemus et al. 2006), indicating that the increased
apoptosis is due to a defect in cell cycle arrest, not simply
an increase in unrepaired DNA breaks.

In mammalian cells that lack both p53 and Chk1
function, DNA damage can induce a type of mitotic
catastrophe in which the mitotic marker phosphohi-
stone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 are present simulta-
neously in the dying cells (Reinhardt et al. 2007).
However, in irradiated grp p53 mutant wing discs, these
markers label two separate cell populations: mitotic cells
stained with anti-phosphohistone H3 are predominantly
in the apical region of the disc, while apoptotic cells

stained with anti-cleaved caspase-3 are largely found in
the basal region (Figure 5, A and B). These results
suggest that these cells do not undergo apoptosis while
in M-phase.

The relationship between grp and puc during p53-
independent apoptosis was also examined. IR-induced
expression of the puc reporter is faster and stronger in
grp p53 double-mutant discs compared to p53 single-
mutant discs (Figure 3, A and B), suggesting that cell
cycle arrest normally helps delay induction of JNK
signaling. The effect of both inactivating cell cycle arrest
and reducing the level of negative feedback signaling by
puc was also examined: grp puc/1 p53 triple-mutant discs
have higher levels of apoptosis than either grp p53 or
puc/1 p53 double-mutant discs (Figure 3, D–G). Thus,
while the inactivation of cell cycle delay accelerates the
formation of cells with elevated JNK signaling, decreas-
ing the negative feedback signal from puc can further
increase the number of cells
that undergo p53-
independent apoptosis following IR.

p53-independent apoptosis reduces the number of
aneuploid cells recovered following IR: The role of
in
p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis
maintaining genomic integrity was examined using an
assay based on haploinsufﬁciency of ribosomal protein
genes. In animals exposed to IR or with mutations in
DNA repair loci, somatic mutations scored by loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) are typically accompanied by loss
of multiple genetic markers and the Minute phenotype,
caused by haploinsufﬁciency of ribosomal protein genes
(Baker et al. 1978). These results indicate that most
LOH was due to segmental aneuploidy (loss of large
chromosomal regions) rather than induction of point
mutations or mitotic recombination. To probe genetic
loss across the entire genome, we scored the frequency of

either dose, indicating that p53-dependent apoptosis is
not essential to eliminate Minute cells following IR
(Figure 6C). This result is inconsistent with a previous
study,
in which an increase in Minute bristles was
reported following IR of late third instar larvae (Lee
et al. 2003). When we repeated this experiment using
the later stage, there was still no signiﬁcant increase in
Minute bristles in p53 mutant animals (Figure S3A). To
help control for differences in genetic background,
additional wild-type and p53 mutant lines were tested.
Again, no increase in Minute bristles was observed in p53
mutants compared to wild-type lines (Figure S3B). It is
possible that the previously reported increase was due to
a second mutation on the p53 mutant chromosome.

Elimination of aneuploid cells by p53-independent
apoptosis could compensate for the apoptotic defect in
p53 mutant animals. To test if p53-independent apopto-
sis helps limit IR-induced aneuploidy, the frequency of
IR-induced Minute bristles was also examined in hid p53
double-mutant animals. At 1000 rad, the frequency
increased from 2% in p53 single-mutant animals to 5%
in double mutants (Figure 6, B and C). Thus, in a p53
mutant background, the p53-independent apoptosis
induced by IR is required to limit genomic instability
as measured by the appearance of adult cells heterozy-
gous for a Minute mutation. If bristle cells are represen-
tative of the (cid:3)50,000 cells in the developing wing, then
(cid:3)2500 (5% of 50,000) Minute cells are induced by IR
per disc and (cid:3)1500 (3% of 50,000) are eliminated by
apoptosis in a p53 single-mutant disc, but not in a p53 hid
double-mutant wing disc.

hid is a target of both p53-dependent and p53-
independent signaling following DNA damage. In hid
single mutants, IR-induced apoptosis is eliminated at
early time points, but only partly reduced at later time
points (Figures 1 and Figure S2F), a phenotype that is
intermediate between p53 single- and hid p53 double-
mutant animals. The increased frequency of Minute
cells in IR-treated hid p53 double mutants compared to
hid single mutants indicates that p53 helps limit the
appearance of aneuploid cells when p53-independent
apoptosis is also blocked (Figure 6C).

Altered brk expression following IR: To explore if IR
broadly disrupts patterned gene expression in the
developing wing, we examined the expression of several
key regulators of wing patterning. Following DNA
damage, missegregation of rearranged or broken chro-
mosomes during mitosis generates cells with segmental
aneuploidy. Reduced copy number of haploinsufﬁcient
genes, such as the Minute genes, could lead to altered
gene expression and apoptosis. Phenotypes associated
with Minute cells in the wing disc include increased
apoptosis, JNK pathway activation, and ectopic expres-
sion of the transcriptional repressor brinker (brk) due to
reduced signaling by the dpp signaling pathway (Moreno
et al. 2002; Tyler et al. 2007). Whereas both JNK and
apoptosis are activated by many different types of cellular

Minute cells following IR. Because the 65 Minute loci
are spread throughout
the euchromatic genome
(Marygold et al. 2007), reduced copy number of most
large genomic regions is likely to result in the Minute
phenotype. Previous studies have used this phenotype to
assay the genetic consequences of diverse sources of
chromosome damage, including mutations in telomere
protection genes (Oikemus et al. 2004, 2006), telomere
loss due to dicentric chromosomes (Ahmad and Golic
1999), mutations in DNA damage response and repair
genes (Brodsky et al. 2000b; Johnson-Schlitz et al.
2007), and induction of DNA breaks by P-element
mobilization (Engels et al. 1987). These studies conﬁrm
that induction of Minute bristles following IR is due to
chromosome damage rather than other types of cellular
damage. It is possible that a small percentage of defective
bristles are not due to induction of aneuploidy, but these
events would probably reﬂect other types of genetic
damage, such as Minute gene point mutations.

Minute cells were scored in adults following X-
irradiation of early third instar larvae. If apoptosis
reduces the number of IR-induced aneuploid cells,
then inhibiting apoptosis should increase the number
of these cells that survive to adulthood. Following
irradiation of wild-type larvae with 1000 rad, 2% of
bristles exhibit the Minute phenotype (Figure 6, A and
C). No difference in the number of defective bristles was
seen in p53 mutant compared to wild-type animals at

stresses,
including altered gene expression patterns
(Umemori et al. 2009), brk may be more speciﬁc for
dpp signaling. brk expression is normally repressed in
the center of developing wing discs and gradually
increases toward the anterior and posterior edges of
the disc (brk-lacZ in Figure 7, A–C). At 24 hr following
IR, individual cells in the center of p53 mutant discs
ectopically express brk and expression in the lateral
regions becomes more irregular (Figure 7, A–C). In-
hibition of apoptosis by p35 expression increases the
number of cells with ectopic brk expression. An average
of 9 cells ectopically express high levels of brk in the
center of the p53 mutant wing discs expressing p35
(SEM ¼ 2.6, n ¼ 5 discs, P-value ,0.01, treated compared
with untreated), while an average of 2.6 cells ectopically
express brk without p35 (SEM ¼ 1.7, n ¼ 5, P-value ,0.01,
treated compared with untreated). (These numbers
signiﬁcantly underestimate the total number of cells with
abnormal brk expression since we excluded cells within or
adjacent to the normal brk expression domain in our
analysis.) Ectopic brk expression following IR is also
observed in wild-type discs, suggesting that induction of
this phenotype by IR can occur in parallel to p53-
dependent apoptosis (Figure S4). In wild-type discs,
p53-dependent apoptosis is induced within 4 hr of X-
irradiation, but ectopic expression of brk is not observed
at this time point (data not shown), indicating that
altered brk expression is not a secondary consequence
of induced apoptosis. Because ectopic brk expression is
sufﬁcient to activate JNK-dependent apoptosis (Martin
et al. 2004), the observed changes in brk expression could
contribute to the elimination of Minute cells (Moreno
et al. 2002).

Although ectopic expression of brk is consistent with
the generation of Minute cells, it could alternatively
reﬂect altered expression of genes that act earlier in the
anterior–posterior patterning hierarchy or reﬂect a
widespread disruption of patterned gene expression
following cellular damage by IR. The expression patterns
of three additional gene products, two with restricted

expression along the anterior–posterior axis (EN and
PTC) and one with restricted expression along the
dorsal–ventral axis (WG), were also examined in irradi-
ated p53 mutant wing discs; no change in expression was
observed for any of these proteins (Figure 7, D–F). This
small-scale survey suggests that irradiation does not
generally disrupt developmental networks and that the
effect on brk expression is not due to loss of the anterior–
posterior compartment (reﬂected by EN expression) or
aberrant activity of the Hedgehog pathway along the
compartment boundary (reﬂected by PTC expression).

DISCUSSION

While p53 plays a conserved role connecting the DNA
damage response pathway to the core apoptotic ma-
chinery, there are also p53-independent mechanisms to
induce cell death following chromosome damage. We
ﬁnd that this p53-independent response in Drosophila
requires the pro-apoptotic gene hid, the apical caspase
dronc, and downstream effector caspases. Proper regu-
lation of the JNK phosphatase puc is required for the full
induction of hid expression and apoptosis following
irradiation of p53 mutant discs. puc and the cell cycle
checkpoint gene grp are negative regulators of this
response and mutations in these genes act additively
to sensitize p53 mutant cells to IR. This response plays
an important in vivo role in limiting the accumulation of
aneuploid cells following IR. We propose that p53-
independent apoptosis reﬂects a second, indirect mech-
anism that acts in parallel to the canonical DNA damage
response pathway to eliminate cells with altered ge-
nomes following IR (Figure 8): in this model, incorrect
repair of IR-induced chromosome breaks generates
cells with segmental aneuploidy, resulting in haploin-
sufﬁciency of genes required for cell survival.

and plays a central role in IR-induced apoptosis. In
mammalian cells lacking p53, components of the DNA
damage response pathway, such as ATR and p73, have
been implicated in damage-induced apoptosis (Roos
and Kaina 2006; Sidi et al. 2008). In this study and
previous work (Oikemus et al. 2004, 2006; Wichmann
et al. 2006; Titen and Golic 2008), genetic analysis of
single and double mutants in components of the
Drosophila DNA damage response pathway suggests
that chromosome damage can induce apoptosis
through a mechanism that does not utilize this pathway.
Consistent with these results, activation of ATM and
ATR kinases following IR (as measured by phospho-
H2Av staining) largely subsides within a few hours of IR
in embryos (Kusch et al. 2004) and discs (our un-
published results), well before increased p53-indepen-
dent apoptosis, JNK target gene expression, or HID.

Furthermore, in a recent study using dicentric chromo-
somes to induce chromosome breaks and telomere loss,
all dicentric chromosomes could induce p53-dependent
apoptosis, but only dicentric chromosomes that led to
aneuploidy could induce p53-independent apoptosis
(Titen and Golic 2008).

In p53 or mnk mutant discs, IR-induced apoptosis is
observed only after cells have recovered from damage-
induced cell cycle delay. This response is accelerated in
double-mutant discs that fail to arrest due to mutations
in the Drosophila chk1 homolog grp. Similarly, p53-
independent induction of puc by IR is observed after
resumption of cell cycle progression in single-mutant
discs and is accelerated by loss of grp. Inhibition of JNK
signaling by overexpression of puc substantially reduces
p53-independent
induction of HID and apoptosis,
suggesting that this response is partly dependent on
the JNK pathway. The remaining apoptosis may either
reﬂect incomplete inhibition of JNK signaling by puc
overexpression or suggest that an alternative pathway
acts in parallel to JNK to promote a lower level of p53-
independent apoptosis. While the only described func-
tion of puc to date is as an inhibitor of JNK signaling, we
cannot rule out the possibility that inhibition of other
pathways by puc contributes to the regulation of p53-
independent apoptosis. Overall, these results suggest
that cell cycle arrest helps delay p53-independent
activation of JNK signaling and apoptosis following IR.
Regulation of genomic stability by p53-dependent
and -independent responses: p53-dependent apoptosis
is hypothesized to help preserve genome stability by
rapidly eliminating cells with severe chromosome dam-
age. In mouse models with elevated genomic instability,
loss of p53 function further increases tumorigenesis
(Attardi 2005). However, temporal analysis of mouse
p53 function following irradiation suggests that the
DNA damage response function of p53 may not be

eliminate aneuploid cells, while p53-dependent apo-
ptosis may play a more critical role in eliminating cells
with genetic damage that is not associated with aneu-
ploidy. Consistent with this interpretation, we ﬁnd that
p53 does contribute to genomic stability in the Minute
assay when the p53-independent response is blocked
(compare hid single-mutant to hid p53 double-mutant
animals).

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant increase in the number of
aneuploid cells recovered following IR when both p53-
dependent and p53-independent apoptosis are blocked.
Inhibition of both pathways results in a 2.5-fold increase
in adult bristle cells with the Minute phenotype, resulting
in 5% of bristle cells exhibiting this severe morphological
defect. These results demonstrate that p53-independent
apoptosis plays an important functional role following IR
by substantially reducing the eventual number of adult
aneuploid cells. Because hid mutations affect both p53-
dependent and p53-independent apoptosis, we cannot
determine whether this response is required for genomic
stability in cells with the normal p53 signaling pathway.
Aneuploidy as a possible apoptotic signal following
IR: A key unresolved question in this study is what signal
activates p53-independent puc and hid expression and
apoptosis following IR. An attractive possibility is that
aneuploidy itself is the signal. In strong support of this
hypothesis,
induction of p53-independent apoptosis
following telomere loss is observed only if the resulting
broken chromosome can lead to aneuploidy (Titen and
Golic 2008). Our analysis of IR-induced Minute bristles
indicates that many aneuploid cells are generated
following IR and then eliminated by apoptosis. In
larvae, chromosome rearrangements appear shortly
after IR (Gatti et al. 1974). IR-induced changes in the
expression of brk, puc, and hid are consistent with the
production of aneuploid cells exhibiting the Minute
phenotype, although these markers are not speciﬁc for
aneuploid cells. Since haploinsufﬁciency of the widely
distributed Minute genes is sufﬁcient to induce apopto-
sis (Moreno et al. 2002; Coelho et al. 2005) and
induction of spontaneous apoptosis in Minute hetero-
zygous animals does not require p53 (L. M. McNamee,
unpublished results), this mechanism should eventually
be activated in aneuploid cells induced by IR. While
Minute genes represent the primary source of loci that
are haploinsufﬁcient for normal growth (Lindsley et al.
1972; Marygold et al. 2007), it is also possible that the
cumulative effect of reduced dosage of many genes in
aneuploid cells disrupts normal gene expression and
cell survival. On the basis of these observations, we
propose that DNA damage indirectly induces apoptosis
by creating chromosome aberrations leading to seg-
mental aneuploidy and activating JNK-dependent and
p53-independent apoptosis (Figure 8). However, we
cannot easily rule out the possibility that an additional
response to IR could kill these cells before apoptosis due
to aneuploidy is activated.

Figure 8.—Model for p53-dependent and p53-independent
apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, cells sense DNA
breaks and activate repair, cell cycle delay, and apoptosis. Fol-
lowing DNA damage, TEFU/dATM and MEI-41/dATR
kinases activate MNK/dChk2 and p53 to induce apoptosis
(orange boxes). p53 regulates the pro-apoptotic genes hid
and rpr, resulting in caspase activation (red box). GRP/dChk1
promotes cell cycle delay, allowing time for DNA repair. Incor-
rect repair of chromosome breaks followed by progression
through mitosis will result in cells with reduced copy number
of large chromosome regions (segmental aneuploidy). Hap-
loinsufﬁciency of genes encoding ribosomal proteins or other
products can induce apoptosis by ectopic brk expression, JNK
pathway activation, and induction of hid expression. Other ap-
optotic mechanisms may also act to remove aneuploid cells
(not shown).

critical for tumor suppression (Christophorou et al.
2006).

In Drosophila, the role of p53 in limiting genomic
instability appears to depend on the source of DNA
damage or the type of genetic alterations assayed. In one
study, telomere loss following dicentric chromosome
formation led to an extremely high frequency of larval
neuroblasts with abnormal karyotypes; p53 helped
reduce the number of abnormal cells over time (Titen
and Golic 2008). Another study using a genetic assay
for LOH at the multiple wing hair (mwh) locus reported
increased LOH following IR in p53 mutant animals
(Sogame et al. 2003), a result we have conﬁrmed with an
independently derived p53 allele (Figure S5). However,
when using the Minute assay to examine genomic
instability, we found that p53 function was not essential
to limit IR-induced aneuploidy, despite the very high
levels of p53-dependent apoptosis normally induced
following IR. Several factors might account for the
different conclusions reached using these assays. In
the mwh assay, two types of genetic damage not associ-
ated with aneuploidy, small deletions or mitotic re-
combination, can be recovered that may not be scored
in the Minute assay. p53-independent apoptosis may be
able to compensate in the absence of p53 function to

Haploinsufﬁciency of ribosomal genes could contrib-
ute to damage-induced apoptosis in vertebrates as well.
In mice heterozygous for ribosomal protein gene
mutations, both p53-dependent and p53-independent
signaling are induced, leading to increased apoptosis
and reduced growth (Panic et al. 2006; Danilova et al.
2008). Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is linked to
haploinsufﬁciency of human ribosomal protein genes
(Draptchinskaia et al. 1999; Gazda and Sieff 2006;
Gazda et al. 2006; Cmejla et al. 2007; Choesmel et al.
2008) and is associated with increased cell death
(Flygare and Karlsson 2007). As in Drosophila,
mammalian ribosomal protein genes are widely distrib-
uted throughout the genome. Thus, genetic or envi-
ronmental changes resulting in aneuploidy should
frequently induce the cellular responses associated with
ribosomal protein gene haploinsufﬁciency.

In summary, we have identiﬁed a p53-independent
pathway that limits the formation of aneuploid cells
through JNK- and HID-dependent apoptosis. We hy-
pothesize that rather than detect damaged chromo-
somes directly, this mechanism is activated by the
reduced dosage of critical loci, such as ribosomal pro-
tein genes, in aneuploid cells.

Inactivation of this response causes an increase in
visibly defective bristle cells following DNA damage.
Thus, in Drosophila, this mechanism helps eliminate
cells that would reduce the ﬁtness of the adult animal.
We have shown that mutations in a cell cycle checkpoint
gene and a JNK phosphatase enhance this response
following IR. These and other components of this
pathway may provide useful targets to reduce the pro-
liferation of aneuploid cancer cells or to sensitize cancer
cells to the effects of DNA-damaging agents.

FIGURE  S1.—Basal  and  apical  caspases  regulate  p53-independent  induction  of  the  apoptotic  marker  anti-C3.  In  all 
panels, anti-C3 (cleaved caspase 3) staining is used to detect apoptosis. (A) In wild type discs, p53-dependent apoptosis is 
observed 4 hours following IR. (B) Anti-C3 staining is not induced in wing discs mutant for the apical caspase Dronc. (C 
and D) The baculovirus protein p35, which blocks the activity of effector caspases following cleavage by apical caspases, is 
expressed  under  control  of  the  posterior-specific  driver  enGal4.  In  an  otherwise  wild  type  disc,  the  pattern  of  anti-C3 
staining  is  initially  altered  following  IR  treatment  and  continues  to  accumulate  over  time.  In  a  p53  mutant  wing  disc, 
more diffuse anti-C3 staining accumulates by 24 hours following IR treatment.

FIGURE  S2.—Basal  caspases,  apical  caspases  and  HID  regulate  p53-independent  induction  of  the  cell  death  marker 
acridine orange. (A) p53-dependent apoptosis is observed four hours following IR. (B and C) p53- and MNK-independent 
apoptosis begins between 8 and 16 hours following IR.  (D and E)  Acridine orange staining is not induced in wings discs 
lacking  the  apical  caspase  Dronc  or  expressing  the  baculovirus  protein  p35  (under  control  of  the  ubiquitous  actinGal4 
driver),  which  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  effector  caspases  Dcp-1  and  Drice.  (F  and  G)  The  pro-apoptotic  gene  hid 
contributes to both p53-dependent apoptosis at early time points and to p53-independent apoptosis at late time points.

FIGURE  S3.—p53-dependent  apoptosis  does  not  reduce  the  number  of  Minute  cells 
following  IR.      (A)  Wandering  third  instar  p53-  or  wild  type  animals  were  treated  with  500, 
1000, and 2000 rads of irradiation or mock treated.  This is the same stage used in a previous 
publication  (LEE  et  al.  2003).  Twenty-five  animals  were  scored  for  each  genotype  in  three 
independent experiments.  No significant difference in  Minute bristles is observed between wt 
or p53- at any dose (n = 3, P-value > 0.05). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean.  (B) 
An  additional  wild  type  chromosome  (p53+)  and  p53- allele  (p535A-1-4)  were  scored  for  Minute 
bristles after treatment with 1000 rads of irradiation during second to early third instar larvae.  
The  additional  wild  type  allele  is  an  isogenic  control  for  p5311-1B-1  isolated  in  parallel  to  the 
original  mutation.  Note  that  the  remaining  data  overlaps  data  presented  for  1000  rads  in 
Figure  6.  Sixty  animals  were  scored  for  each  genotype  in  three  independent  experiments.  
There was no significant difference in Minute bristles following IR in these alleles compared to 
wild type (n = 3, P-value > 0.05). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean.

FIGURE  S4.—brk  is  ectopically  expressed  following  irradiation  of  discs  with  wild 
type  p53  function.  (A)  Ectopic  expression  of  brk  following  IR  is  observed  following 
irradiation of discs with wild type p53 function that express p35; this result indicates 
that the absence of p53 is not required for this response.  (B) Similar levels of ectopic 
brk following IR are also observed in p53 mutant wing discs expressing p35. Scale bar 
= 50µm.

FIGURE  S5.—p53-dependent  apoptosis  limits  the  accumulation  of  mwh-/-  cells  following  IR.      Wandering  third 
instar  larvae  heterozygous  for  a  mutation  in  the  mwh  locus  were  treated  with  0,  250,  or  1000  rads.  The  average 
number of mwh-/- clones (A) or cells (B) per wing was calculated to determine rates of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as 
previously described (BAKER et al. 1978; BRODSKY et al. 2000b). p53 mutant wings had more mwh mutant clones and 
mutant  cells  than  wild  type  at  both  doses  (n  =  5,  P-value  <  0.05),  confirming  a  previously  published  conclusion 
(SOGAME et al. 2003). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean.
