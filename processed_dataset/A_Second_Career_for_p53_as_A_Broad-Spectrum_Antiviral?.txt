Abstract: As the world exits the global pandemic caused by the previously unknown SARS-CoV-2,
we also mark the 30th anniversary of p53 being named “molecule of the year” by Science based on its
role as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 was originally discovered in association with a viral protein,
studies on its role in preventing carcinogenesis have far overshadowed research related to p53(cid:48)s role in
viral infections. Nonetheless, there is an extensive body of scientiﬁc literature demonstrating that p53
is a critical component of host immune responses to viral infections. It is striking that diverse viruses
have independently developed an impressive repertoire of varied mechanisms to counter the host
defenses that are mediated by and through p53. The variety of ways developed by viruses to disrupt
p53 in their hosts attests to the protein’s importance in combatting viral pathogens. The present
perspective aims to make the case that p53 ought to be considered a virus suppressor in addition to a
tumor suppressor. It is hoped that additional research aimed at more fully understanding the role of
p53 in antiviral immunity will result in the world being better positioned for the next pandemic than
it was when SARS-CoV-2 emerged to produce COVID-19.

1. The Role of p53 in Cancer and the Potential of TP53 Gene Therapy

When p53 was named “molecule of the year” by Science in December 1993, the ac-
companying editorial stated “p53 and its fellow tumor suppressors are generating an
excitement that suggests prevention now and hope for a cure of a terrible killer in the
not-too-distant future” [1]. Although the “not-too-distant future” was not deﬁned in the
editorial, cancer is still with us, and researchers are still seeking to understand how p53
functions as a tumor suppressor and how best to translate this understanding to beneﬁt
cancer patients [2,3]. Contributing to the excitement around p53 back then were reports by
two independent groups that simultaneously published papers in Nature [4] and Science [5]
demonstrating that germline alterations in the TP53 gene explained the propensity to
develop cancers within what have come to be called Li-Fraumeni families. In the ensuing
years, p53 solidiﬁed its reputation as a tumor suppressor with more than half of sporadic
human tumors carrying some form of TP53 alteration [6]. Even in tumors that have wild-
type p53, dysregulations in pathways either upstream or downstream of p53 are frequently
seen.

Based on p53’s tumor suppressor activity, TP53 gene therapy to restore wild-type
p53 has long been envisioned as a potential approach in cancer treatment [3]. Both viral
and non-viral gene delivery technologies have been employed to achieve expression of
exogenous wild-type p53 in tumors. One example of TP53 gene therapy is found in the
investigational agent termed SGT-53, which is an immuno-lipid nanoparticle comprising a
cationic liposome targeted via a single chain antibody fragment recognizing the human
transferrin receptor and carrying as its payload a plasmid expression vector encoding
human wild-type p53 [7,8]. SGT-53 has been shown to be well tolerated by patients in two
Phase I trials [9,10] and is now being assessed in patients with advanced pancreatic cancers
in a Phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT02340117; accessed 13 November 2023).

2. The Function of p53 as a Pleiotropic Transcription Factor

One of the more useful and inﬂuential descriptions of cancer envisions the disease
as having ten hallmarks that include alterations in metabolism, angiogenesis, genetic
instability, immune evasion, cell death, replicative immortality, sustained proliferation,
invasion/metastasis, inﬂammation, and the tumor microenvironment [11]. Each of these
hallmarks have been individually linked to p53 [12], reinforcing the notion that p53(cid:48)s ability
to act as a tumor suppressor derives from its inﬂuence on multiple cellular pathways. We
now know that p53 acts as a pleiotropic transcription factor in regulating a relatively large
number of downstream target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair,
cellular metabolism, and cell death [13]. One function of p53 that has drawn considerable
attention from researchers in the ﬁeld of oncology over the last three decades is its role in
responses to the DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic
agents that are used in the treatment of cancer patients. When cells are exposed to ionizing
radiation, a frequently used stimulus of p53 activity, induction of about 500 different genes
and repression of a smaller number of genes are observed [14,15]. Both ionizing radiation
and certain chemotherapeutic agents can lead to double-strand breaks in cellular DNA
(see Figure 1, upper panel), with p53 being a major determinant of this transcriptional
response [16]. The fate of cells with damaged DNA can be either DNA repair and emergence
from cell cycle arrest or irreversible growth arrest and death via apoptosis [2,3]. Although
the cellular fate that prevails differs from one cell type to another, both of these DNA
damage responses are regulated transcriptionally by p53. The familiar moniker “guardian
of the genome” [17] derives from the DNA damage responses regulated transcriptionally by
p53. Traditional cancer treatment modalities can induce DNA damage; thus, disruption of
p53 tends to render tumors less sensitive to radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies [18].
The resultant radio- and chemoresistance of tumors contributes to the association seen
between p53 disruption and poorer patient outcomes in a number of cancer types [19–21].
Restoration of p53 in tumors via gene therapy has long been seen as a way of sensitizing
cancers to these traditional treatment modalities [22], and TP53 gene therapy has been
most often envisioned in the context of a combination therapy involving chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy. For example, the previously mentioned Phase II trial of SGT-53
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT02340117; accessed 13 November 2023) combines TP53
gene therapy with the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced pancreatic
cancers.

As the age of immunotherapies in oncology has emerged, it has become clear that
disruption of p53 can also affect the immune system’s ability to identify and destroy tu-
mors [23,24], which is central to effective cancer immunotherapy. A current mainstay of
immunotherapy against tumors is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [25,26]. The
ability of tumor-targeted TP53 gene therapy to augment the antitumor efﬁcacy of ICIs has
now been documented in several preclinical models [27–31]. As with the more traditional
cancer treatment modalities, the response (or lack thereof) of tumors to immunotherapy
is governed by an elaborate network of expressed genes, many of which are regulated
directly or indirectly by p53, the pleiotropic transcription factor. Available data suggest
that restoration of p53 via gene therapy alters the expression of a number of immunogenic
markers on the surface of tumor cells and induces immunogenic cell death to render tumors
more immunologically “hot”, i.e., responsive to immunotherapy (see Figure 1, middle
panel) [27–31]. The pleiotropic nature of p53 as a transcription factor means that the loss
or alteration of p53 would be expected to impact multiple cellular pathways involved in
antitumor immune responses. It follows that any restoration of p53 function could move
cancer cells back toward normalcy on multiple fronts, including not only their response
to traditional therapies (i.e., radiotherapy and chemotherapy) but also to immunotherapy
based on ICIs. Indeed, it appears that multiple p53-regulated genes participate in turning
an immunologically “cold” tumor “hot” [27–31]. An attractive aspect of p53 restoration via
gene therapy is that one can actually be agnostic as to which of the many p53-regulated
genes are contributing to enhanced responses of tumors expressing exogenous p53. With

p53 restoration comes all of the downstream genes and pathways that appear to play an
important role in improving responsiveness to both more traditional therapeutic regimens
and antitumor immunotherapies.

Figure 1. P53 serves as both “guardian of the genome” and “guardian of immune integrity”. Upper
panel: Double-strand DNA breaks can occur when cells are exposed to environmental stresses,
including ionizing radiation or DNA-modifying chemicals used in cancer treatments. In response
to the DNA damage, p53 modulates the expression of many genes, including those involved in cell
cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The fate of the damaged cell can either be an exit from
cell cycle arrest with its DNA repaired or apoptotic death. In either case, the genome is effectively
“guarded” [17]. Middle panel: Tumor cells with disruption of p53-mediated pathways can evade
immune surveillance to qualify as an immunologically “cold” tumor, i.e., one that does not trigger a
robust immune response and is refractory to cancer immunotherapy. Restoration of p53 (e.g., via gene
therapy) can convert the “cold” tumor into an immunologically “hot” tumor that is more responsive
to the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer immunotherapy. Lower panel: Infecting
viruses of diverse types seek to disrupt p53-mediated host pathways to create an environment that is
more “virus-friendly”, i.e., favoring their replication and spread [32]. Maintaining or elevating p53
(e.g., via gene therapy) would be expected to enhance host antiviral responses mediated by interferons
(IFNs) and/or trigger apoptosis (“altruistic suicide” [33]), thereby limiting viral propagation.

3. The Role of p53 in Host Defenses against Viral Infections

The same p53 that generated all the excitement three decades ago as a tumor suppres-
sor is also a virus suppressor, and this fact should generate some excitement of its own.
The discovery of p53 in 1979 was in the context of its association with a viral protein (SV40
large T-antigen) [2]. In addition, a linkage between p53 and infectious diseases was evident
in early studies with p53 knockout mice. These mice developed tumors as anticipated,

Viruses 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 10   in turning an immunologically “cold” tumor “hot” [27–31]. An attractive aspect of p53 restoration via gene therapy is that one can actually be agnostic as to which of the many p53-regulated genes are contributing to enhanced responses of tumors expressing exoge-nous p53. With p53 restoration comes all of the downstream genes and pathways that appear to play an important role in improving responsiveness to both more traditional therapeutic regimens and antitumor immunotherapies.  Figure 1. P53 serves as both “guardian of the genome” and “guardian of immune integrity”. Upper panel: Double-strand DNA breaks can occur when cells are exposed to environmental stresses, in-cluding ionizing radiation or DNA-modifying chemicals used in cancer treatments. In response to the DNA damage, p53 modulates the expression of many genes, including those involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The fate of the damaged cell can either be an exit from cell cycle arrest with its DNA repaired or apoptotic death. In either case, the genome is eﬀectively “guarded” [17]. Middle panel: Tumor cells with disruption of p53-mediated pathways can evade immune surveillance to qualify as an immunologically “cold” tumor, i.e., one that does not trigger a robust immune response and is refractory to cancer immunotherapy. Restoration of p53 (e.g., via gene therapy) can convert the “cold” tumor into an immunologically “hot” tumor that is more re-sponsive to the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer immunotherapy. Lower panel: Infecting viruses of diverse types seek to disrupt p53-mediated host pathways to create an environ-ment that is more “virus-friendly”, i.e., favoring their replication and spread [32]. Maintaining or elevating p53 (e.g., via gene therapy) would be expected to enhance host antiviral responses medi-ated by interferons (IFNs) and/or trigger apoptosis (“altruistic suicide” [33]), thereby limiting viral propagation.   Viruses 2023, 15, 2377

but about one-quarter of them died of unresolved infections prior to the appearance of
tumors, suggesting that the loss of p53 resulted in a compromised immune system [34].
Subsequently, p53 knockout mice were shown to exhibit more severe disease after infec-
tions by inﬂuenza viruses [35]. In contrast, ﬁbroblasts derived from “super p53 mice”
having an extra copy of p53 exhibited higher resistance to the vesicular stomatitis virus [36],
suggesting that even a rather modest increase in the TP53 copy number can render cells
more resistant to viral infections.

Viruses and their hosts do battle at the molecular level with the host using its gene
products to detect viral infection and to suppress viral propagation. On the other hand,
viruses employ diverse strategies to counter any mechanisms of their would-be host that
impede viral replication. From the perspective of the virus, p53 is a defensive weapon of
the host that needs to be neutralized or circumvented in some way. Why do viruses ﬁnd it
so necessary to oppose host p53? The answer appears to be in the many genes and cellular
pathways that are downstream of p53. Triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis or
ferroptosis) in response to “stresses” is considered a “canonical” function of p53 that is
central to its tumor suppressor activity. Viral infections are also stressful, and apoptosis
can be triggered by the incoming viral genomic DNA or RNA. This cell death in response
to foreign viral nucleic acids may accomplish “altruistic suicide” that is a component
of innate immunity [33], whereby the early death of the initially infected cells impedes
viral replication and limits the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In addition, the
antiviral activity of p53 involves the regulation of diverse pathways producing interferons
(IFNs). Regulation of type 1 IFNs is complicated and involves several p53-regulated cellular
pathways, including increases in interferon regulatory factors IRF5, IRF7, and IRF9, each of
which is transcriptionally regulated by p53 [37–39]. Signaling mediated by IFNs induces
expression of a number of genes collectively referred to as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).
These ISGs are varied, with some recognizing viral RNA replicative intermediates and
others impeding viral replication by degrading viral RNA or inhibiting its translation to
reduce the levels of viral proteins in the infected cell [40,41].

All available evidence suggests that p53 is a key participant in innate as well as
adaptive antiviral immune responses [42,43]. Because p53 transcriptionally regulates many
downstream genes=, viruses can negate a plethora of cellular defensive pathways by
focusing their mechanisms for host evasion on p53. A virus with the ability to disable host
p53 would reduce cellular levels of type 1 IFNs and thereby evade the range of its antiviral
effects, including protection of uninfected bystander cells [40]. In analogy to its role as a
tumor suppressor, it is likely there is more to p53’s viral suppressor activity than driving
apoptosis and production of type 1 IFNs. Just as it has proven difﬁcult to determine which
of p53’s various activities is most crucial for its tumor suppressor functions [44], it will
also likely prove challenging to distinguish which of the many p53-regulated genes and
pathways are most critical for its viral suppressor activity. Nonetheless, the role of p53 in
immune responses is generally now very well documented [23,43]. Disruption of p53 in
tumors can affect the recruitment as well as the activity of myeloid and T cells, contributing
to immune evasion by cancer cells. The growing appreciation of the role of p53 in immune
responses has led to the suggestion that p53 be given the additional moniker “guardian of
immune integrity” [32].

During evolutionary adaptation to their hosts, diverse viruses have developed a wide
range of strategies to reduce p53 levels or attenuate its activity [43,45–48]. Many viruses
encode subversive proteins that, in analogy to SV40 large T-antigen, directly interact with
p53 to affect its activities, whereas other viruses use more indirect means of disrupting
p53-mediated cellular processes. A detailed description of the various strategies by which
viruses target and circumvent p53-mediated antiviral pathways is beyond the scope of
this perspective. Sufﬁce to say that, in order to thrive, viruses must subvert host defense
mechanisms in which p53 participates, and some viruses employ more than one anti-p53
strategy. Dr. Arnold Levine, one of the discoverers of p53, has stated that “almost every
successful virus has developed ways to inactivate p53” [43]. The very diversity of the

Viruses 2023, 15, 2377

5 of 9

repertoire of mechanisms used by viruses to disable p53 clearly attests to the importance of
p53 in host antiviral defenses.

Among the viruses with countermeasures against p53 are the coronaviruses that
include SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent in the COVID-19 pandemic, which sadly has
been a very successful virus in terms of its ability to infect humans. Two cell types that
are part of the ﬁrst line of defense against airborne viruses are lung alveolar macrophages
and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the latter being a major source of type 1 IFNs. Alveolar
macrophages appear to be the ﬁrst immune cells encountered by incoming respiratory
viruses [49], and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in alveolar macrophages [50]. Several
reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a relatively weak expression of IFNs in the
lungs [50,51]. Use of type 1 IFNs against the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has
been studied [52], and vapor inhalation of IFN-alpha in combination with ribavirin has
been used against COVID-19 in China [53]. Although the interplay between coronaviruses
and the type 1 IFN response is complicated [54], coronaviruses encode a protease with
deubiquitinating activity that effectively reduces the level of p53 present in host cells
following viral infection [46]. The weak IFN response in the lungs of COVID-19 patients
would be consistent with the virus using this protease to reduce the p53 levels in the
lung cells that would otherwise combat the infection via p53-regulated IFN pathways.
Would alveolar macrophages be more effective in halting a SARS-CoV-2 infection if their
p53 levels could be increased via TP53 gene therapy? The investigational agent SGT-53
was designed to treat cancers that overexpress transferrin receptors. The rationale for
repurposing this investigational agent to boost innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has
been described [55] and is schematically depicted in Figure 2. Of particular relevance is the
fact that both alveolar macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells express transferrin
receptors [56,57], and so both of these critical defensive cell types should be targeted by
SGT-53 that uses cellular transferrin receptors to achieve TP53 gene delivery.

Figure 2. The potential use of TP53 gene therapy against coronaviruses infections. Coronaviruses, like
other viruses, seek to thwart host defenses by decreasing p53 levels in the infected host cells. In the
case of coronaviruses, this is accomplished via a protease that degrades p53 (upper panel). SGT-53 is
a nanocomplex for TP53 gene therapy that was developed for oncology applications. SGT-53 has been
proposed as an antiviral agent to combat coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 [55] by virtue of enhancing
host innate immune responses regulated by p53 (lower panel). SGT-53 is a nanocomplex carrying a
plasmid with the gene for wild-type human p53 within a cationic liposome that is decorated with
a targeting moiety in the form of a single-chain monoclonal antibody fragment that recognizes the
human transferrin receptor. SGT-53 was developed as a cancer therapeutic agent [7,8].

The Next Pandemic In the next pandemic caused by a hypothetical unknown virus that will emerge in the future, an approach based on enhancing innate antiviral immunity might prove ad-vantageous over those strategies based on vaccines, since prophylactic vaccines require isolation and identiﬁcation of the infectious agent and will take considerable time and eﬀort to develop, test, and dispense. Moreover, success in producing antiviral vaccines is far from guaranteed—there is still no available HIV vaccine nearly 40 years after this virus was identiﬁed as the etiological agent in AIDS. The eﬀectiveness of a vaccine is generally restricted to the virus for which it was designed (and perhaps some closely related vari-ants), so vaccines tend not to be broad-spectrum protectors.

Boosting innate immunity has the potential to protect against any virus that might come along in the future, even if that virus is being encountered by humans for the very ﬁrst time. In addition to the possibility of another viral pandemic beyond COVID-19 caused by an unknown virus, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has identiﬁed cer-tain viruses as potential weapons of mass destruction or agents with potential use in bio-logical terrorism [58]. The very nature of bioterrorism would predict that the identiﬁcation of a potentially deadly virus being employed by the terrorists would likely come only sometime after the ﬁrst victims have been exposed. Warﬁghters facing an adversary using potentially deadly biological agents are also likely to be exposed to initially unidentiﬁed viruses.

4. The Next Pandemic

In the next pandemic caused by a hypothetical unknown virus that will emerge
in the future, an approach based on enhancing innate antiviral immunity might prove
advantageous over those strategies based on vaccines, since prophylactic vaccines require
isolation and identiﬁcation of the infectious agent and will take considerable time and
effort to develop, test, and dispense. Moreover, success in producing antiviral vaccines
is far from guaranteed—there is still no available HIV vaccine nearly 40 years after this
virus was identiﬁed as the etiological agent in AIDS. The effectiveness of a vaccine is
generally restricted to the virus for which it was designed (and perhaps some closely
related variants), so vaccines tend not to be broad-spectrum protectors. In contrast, the
innate immune system is poised to oppose any and all infectious agents whether known
or unknown. Boosting innate immunity has the potential to protect against any virus that
might come along in the future, even if that virus is being encountered by humans for the
very ﬁrst time.

In addition to the possibility of another viral pandemic beyond COVID-19 caused by
an unknown virus, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has identiﬁed certain
viruses as potential weapons of mass destruction or agents with potential use in biological
terrorism [58]. The very nature of bioterrorism would predict that the identiﬁcation of a
potentially deadly virus being employed by the terrorists would likely come only sometime
after the ﬁrst victims have been exposed. Warﬁghters facing an adversary using potentially
deadly biological agents are also likely to be exposed to initially unidentiﬁed viruses. In
either scenario, it would be desirable to have a life-saving option that could be more rapidly
beneﬁcial to virus-exposed individuals than is afforded by the lengthy path of identifying
the culprit pathogen and developing a vaccine. The ideal therapeutic to address emerging
or even newly created viruses that are released either unintentionally or intentionally by a
malicious party engaging in biowarfare of bioterrorism would be a countermeasure that
provides post-exposure protection against a broad spectrum of potential infectious agents,
thereby allowing ﬁrst responders and caregivers to remain agnostic regarding the precise
nature of the infectious agent being employed. Increasing the level of cellular expression of
a general virus suppressor like p53 may well be a means of achieving such broad-spectrum
protection for individuals exposed to an unidentiﬁed viral threat agent.

Therapeutic targeting of p53 and certainly TP53 gene therapy as an antiviral strategy
are unorthodox notions. Antiviral drug development has historically been driven by
the viral life cycle, with most antiviral agents being small chemical compounds (e.g.,
nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, etc.) that directly target either
viral replication per se or inhibit a cellular process required for viral replication [59,60].
Viruses replicate intracellularly and rely on the host’s synthetic machinery; thus, ﬁnding
drugs capable of targeting viral replication without affecting critical processes of the host
cell has proven challenging. The overlap between processes involved in viral replication
and those used by our own cells can lead to untoward side effects of antiviral drugs. For
example, nucleoside analogs are being used as antivirals, but these drugs can be toxic
and/or mutagenic to host cells [61]. The product labels for approved antiviral drugs
tend to list numerous potential serious side effects, and concerns about adverse events
associated with these drugs are heightened when they are given to certain individuals (e.g.,
children, the elderly, pregnant women, immune-compromised individuals, or those with
other pre-existing conditions). TP53 gene therapy as an antiviral strategy differs from more
traditional antiviral drugs in that it aims to boost innate immunity by increasing the level
of a normal human protein that is already being expressed at some level in every cell of the
body. Thus, restoring p53 expression in cells where its level or activity has been diminished
by viral infection offers the possibility of broad-spectrum, pathogen-agnostic protection
with minimal toxicity. It should be noted that very good safety proﬁles were observed in
the Phase I SGT-53 oncology trials [9,10]. The extensive body of evidence of successful
viruses with mechanisms to combat host p53-based defenses certainly makes exploring p53
maintenance and/or its restoration worthy of additional research in virology.

5. Summary and Perspectives

Not all cellular organisms face the threat of developing a tumor, but all such organisms
do encounter infectious agents. It would therefore appear likely that the role of p53 (and
closely related proteins p63 and p73) in innate immunity predates its better-known function
as a tumor suppressor that earned it the distinction of “molecule of the year” back in 1993.
Indeed, the DNA-binding domains that enable p53 and its relatives to function as tran-
scription factors have been preserved over large evolutionary timeframes [2], suggesting
functions in gene regulation that predate the need to suppress tumors. Nonetheless, in a
word-association game, if participants are given the prompt of “p53”, the most common
response would likely be “tumor suppressor”. A response of “virus suppressor” would
be equally valid. The antiviral roles played by p53 in innate immunity have undoubtedly
taken a back seat to its role in cancers in terms of research efforts. Since 1993, research on
p53 has accelerated and the vast majority of this effort has focused on oncology. A crude
bibliometric analysis using “p53” as a search term to probe for publications indexed in
PubMed® (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; accessed on 13 November 2023) revealed
over 5000 p53 papers published in 2022 compared to under 1000 back in 1993. This anal-
ysis found a total of over 115,000 publications using “p53” as a search term. Of these
papers, over 100,000 (~87%) were also hits for “p53 AND tumor”. This compares to under
10,000 papers (~8%) that were hits with “p53 AND virus”. It appears that research on the
connection between p53 and viral infections may actually be diminishing over time. In
2022, over 5000 publications emerge from PubMed® with “p53” as a search term and less
than 300 (~5%) of these papers are hits with “p53 AND virus”. Whereas annual “p53” as
well as “p53 AND tumor” publications have increased dramatically between 2000 and
2022, papers on “p53 AND virus” have decreased by ~40% over that same period. As
we exit the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a formerly unknown virus, it seems
paradoxical that the interest in p53(cid:48)s antiviral activity among researchers (as reﬂected in
publication numbers) would be waning. Since the list of viruses that interfere with p53 in
one way or another is long [45–48], restoration of p53 might very well be useful in aborting
infections by a broad spectrum of viruses, including that newly emerging virus that will
bring on the next pandemic. Our ﬁrst line of defense against that pathogen (and the one
after that one) will be innate immunity. There remains much to be learned by exploring the
mechanisms by which p53 opposes viral infections and probing the variety of means used
by different viruses to evade p53-mediated host defenses. This understanding may help
equip the world to handle the next viral pandemic more effectively than it did the last. In
the not-too-distant future, p53 may regain its title as “molecule of the year” on the basis of
its second career as a broad-spectrum virus suppressor.
