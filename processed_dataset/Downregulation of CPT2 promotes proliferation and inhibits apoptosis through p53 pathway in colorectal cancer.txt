Background: Downregulation of Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 (CPT2) has been shown to be highly associated 
with the progression of several cancers, but little known about its expression, biological functions and mecha-
nisms in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Methods: Bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data 
sets was used to explore the expression of CPT2, the relationship between CPT2 expression and clinicopathologic 
features, as well as the overall survival of CRC. Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze 
independent prognostic factors of CRC. In vitro, CRC tissues were analyzed by RT-qPCR, IHC, IF and western 
blotting to verify CPT2 expression. Colony formation, CCK-8, cell cycle, apoptosis, transwell and wound healing 
assays were performed to examine the functions of CPT2 in CRC. In vivo, nude mouse xenograft experiment was 
used to further examine the effect of CPT2 on tumorigenesis. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
was  conducted  to  explore  the  downstream  pathway  of  CPT2.  The  regulation  of  p53  pathway  by  CPT2  was 
verified by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. 
Results: CPT2 expression was frequently downregulated in CRC and correlated with poor prognosis. Low CPT2 
expression  was  significantly  associated  with  age,  lymph  node  metastasis,  distant  metastasis  and  TMN  stage. 
Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that low CPT2 expression was an independent prognostic factor 
for poorer overall survival. Functionally, overexpression of CPT2 in CRC cells induced growth suppression, cell 
cycle arrest at the G1 phase, enhanced apoptosis and reduced cell migration and invasion. Conversely, knock-
down of CPT2 contributed to cell proliferation, migration and invasion, increased the proportion of S phase cells, 
decreased  the  proportion  of  G1  phase  cells  and  inhibited  apoptosis.  Mechanistically,  we  found  that  CPT2 
overexpression can increase p53 expression by activating p-p53, leading to p21, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved 
caspase-3 and cleaved PARP activation and Bcl2, MDM2 deactivation, thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation and 
promoting apoptosis. CPT2 knockdown yielded opposite results. 
Conclusion: These findings suggest that CPT2 may be a novel prognostic marker of CRC and downregulation of 
CPT2 can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis through p53 pathway in CRC. Strategies targeting CPT2 
may be developed as therapies for CRC.   

1. Introduction 

Colorectal cancer is the commonest gastrointestinal malignancy and 
seriously  harms  human  health.  In  2020,  more  than  1.9  million  new 
colorectal cancer patients were diagnosed worldwide, and the disease 
caused  935,  000  deaths.  All  in  all,  colorectal  cancer  ranks  third  in 

incidence,  but  second  in  mortality  only  to  lung  cancer  [1].  Although 
considerable advances have been made in diagnosis and treatment, the 
mortality  rate  among  CRC  patients  remains  very  high  and  induces  a 
major health burden in the world [2,3]. Therefore, it is very important to 
explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CRC progression and 
find new biomarkers or therapeutic targets for CRC.

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, which is essential to 
basic  human  development  and  physiology  [4].  Dysregulation  of 
apoptosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of various human dis-
eases including cancer [5]. Evasion of apoptosis is a natural barrier to 
cancer  development  [6].  Cells  undergo  apoptosis  includes  two  major 
pathways:  the  extrinsic  pathway  (death  receptor  pathway)  and  the 
intrinsic  pathway  (the  mitochondrial  pathway)  [7].  Mitochondrial 
involves  mitochondrial  outer  membrane  per-
apoptosis,  which 
meabilization (MOMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore 
opening, plays a critical role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [8,9]. In 
mammalian cells, the balance of Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins 
and the proapoptotic proteins is universally acknowledged as a cellular 
rheostat that controls the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic stresses [10]. 
The  Bcl-2  family  of  proteins  controls  cell  death  primarily  by  direct 
binding  interactions  that  regulate  MOMP  leading  to  the  irreversible 
release of intermembrane space proteins, subsequent caspase activation 
and  apoptosis  [11].  Notably,  p53-mediated  apoptosis  employs  this 
mitochondrial cell death pathway [12]. Evidence suggests that the anti- 
apoptotic and proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family are important 
effectors of p53-mediated MOMP [13]. p53 is a tumor suppressor pro-
tein that limits cellular proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis [14]. Dysregulation of p53 plays a crucial role in the occur-
rence and development of colorectal cancer [15]. 

Carnitine  palmitoyltransferase  (CPT)  is  a  kind  of  acyltransferase 
existing in the inner membrane of mitochondria and plays an essential 
role in the process of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) [16]. The CPT system is 
made up of two genetically different mitochondrial membrane binding 
enzymes  CPT1  and  CPT2  [16,17].  CPT1  is  located  in  the  outer  of 
mitochondrial membrane, includes three tissue-specific subtypes: liver 
subtype CPT1A, muscle subtype CPT1B and brain subtype CPT1C, while 
CPT2 is located in the inner of the mitochondrial membrane and is a 
widespread  protein  [17].  CPT2  gene  is  located  at  human  1p32  and 
consisted of 658 amino acids (74 ku) [17]. The deficiency or dysfunction 
of CPT2 usually induces some lipid metabolic diseases, such as obesity, 
diabetes,  NAFLD  and  Cardiac  hypertrophy  [18–20].  Currently,  abun-
dant studies have reported that CPT1 was closely related to the occur-
rence and development of tumor cells in breast cancer [21], lung cancer 
[22],  CRC  [23],  gastric  cancer  [24],  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC) 
[25], prostate cancer [26] and ovarian cancer (OC) [27]. While, CPT2 is 
rarely  studied  in  cancer  compared  with  CPT1.  Recently,  increasing 
studies  have  demonstrated  that  CPT2  plays  an  important  role  in  the 
progression of HCC [28,29], triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [30] 
and  OC  [31].  However,  the  role  of  CPT2  in  CRC  remains  largely  un-
known.  Therefore,  our  research  focuses  on  the  biological  effects  and 
potential mechanisms of CPT2 in CRC. 

In this study, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological 
correlation  of  CPT2  in  primary  CRC  and  its  biological  functions.  We 
further  explored  the  possible  molecular  mechanisms  of  CPT2  in  CRC 
cells. 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Bioinformatics analysis 

To determine the mRNA expression of CPT2 in colorectal cancer, 612 
Transcriptome Profiling RNA-Seqs of 544 cases that included 449 colon 
cancer  and  95  rectal  cancer  patients  and  corresponding  548  clinico-
pathological  data  were  downloaded  from  TCGA  database.  The  612 
transcripts included 44 normal samples and 568 tumor samples. After 
data  analysis,  446  complete  clinicopathological  characteristics, 
including  survival  time  (follow-up  ≥30  days),  survival  status,  age, 
gender, TMN stage, T stage, M stage and lymph node status were ob-
tained and the 102 samples with incomplete clinical information were 
removed. The data sets GSE87211 and GSE44076 associated with CRC 
were downloaded from GEO database. Differences were compared using 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests in unpaired samples of TCGA and GEO data and 

the paired samples were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Cate-
gorical data were analyzed by logistic regression and χ2 test. Kaplan- 
Meier  analysis  of  CPT2  expression  and  survival  probability  in  the 
GSE17536  and  GSE14333  datasets  were  obtained  from  the  online 
database PrognoScan. Kaplan–Meier and Log rank tests were also per-
formed on the TCGA data. Cox's proportional hazards regression model 
was used to analyze independent prognostic factors. To further reveal 
the molecular mechanisms of CPT2 in CRC. We used Pearson correlation 
to calculate the correlation of CPT2 with other genes in the TCGA data. 
GSEA version 4.0.3 (Broad Institute, USA) was also used to analyze the 
TCGA  data.  The  gene  set  “c2.cp.kegg.v7.3.symbols.gmt”  was  down-
loaded  from  the  Molecular  Signatures  Database  and  used  for  the 
enrichment  analysis. 1000 permutations were chosen to  calculate the 
normalized enrichment score (NES), normal p-value, and false discovery 
rate (FDR q-value) [32]. 

2.2. Patient sample collection 

In this study, 30 fresh CRC tissues and paired cancer-adjacent normal 
tissues  were  randomly  collected  from  the  First  Affiliated  Hospital  of 
Chongqing  Medical  University  (Chongqing,  China,  from  June  to 
September  2020),  with  no  radiotherapy  or  chemotherapy  before  the 
operation.  Upon  collection,  all  specimens  were  snap-frozen  in  liquid 
nitrogen  and  stored  at  (cid:0) 80 
C  until  use.  We  collected  40  cases  of 
paraffin-embedded CRC tissues and paired cancer-adjacent normal tis-
sues from the Department of Pathology of Chongqing Medical University 
(April  2017  to  February  2019),  which  were  used  to  measure  protein 
levels. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and performed 
in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Informed consent was signed by all patients.

Human CRC cell lines HCT116, HT29, HCT15, SW480, LOVO were 
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, 
USA),  NCM460  cell  line  was  donated  by  Dr.  Yongyu  Chen  from  the 
Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. HCT116, 
HT29,  HCT15,  SW480  and  NCM460  were  cultured  in  high  glucose 
DMEM  (Gibco,  NY,  USA)  containing  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS) 
(Biological Industries, Israel). LOVO was cultured in F12/DMEM (Gibco, 
NY, USA) medium containing 10% FBS. All the cells were cultured at 
37 
C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Puromycin-resistant lenti-
virus-CPT2 and blank lentivirus-Vector were purchased from Genechem 
(Genechem,  shanghai,  China).  HCT116  and  SW480  cells  were  trans-
fected with the lentivirus according to the manufacturer instructions, 2

40 cycles at 95 
C for 30 s. 
C for 5 s, with annealing and extension at 60 
β-actin was used as a control [33]. Gene expression level was calculated 
by  the  2  (cid:0) ΔΔCt  method  [34].  The  primer  pairs  used  are  listed  in 
Table 1. 

2.5. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) 

◦

IHC  staining  was  performed  according  to  a  previously  described 
procedure [35]. Tissue sections were incubated overnight with primary 
antibody  CPT2  (ab181114;  1:50,  Abcam),  Ki67  (WL0280a;  1:100, 
Wanleibio) at 4 
C. Then, the sections were incubated with secondary 
antibody (HRP-labeled Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L), 1:50, Beyotime) for 
30 min. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The 
tissue  sections  were  imaged  with  a  Leica  microscope  imaging  system 
(Leica  Microsystems,  Germany).  To  evaluate  CPT2  expression,  all 
immunohistochemical images were analyzed using Image Pro Plus (IPP, 
version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), as described 
previously [36]. The mean optical density (MOD), a quantitative mea-
sure  of  stain  intensity,  was  analyzed  to  determine  average  protein 
expression. 

For IF staining, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. 
Antigen retrieval was achieved by microwave treatment in EDTA buffer, 
pH  9.0  (Beyotime,  Shanghai,  China),  and  blockage  of  non-specific 
antibody  binding  was  carried  out with  5%  BSA (Beyotime,  Shanghai, 
China).  Then,  sections  were  incubated  with  primary  antibody  CPT2 
(ab181114,  1:100,  Abcam)  overnight  at  4 
C.  After  treatment  with 
secondary antibody (Cy3-labeled Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L), 1:500, 
Beyotime), sections were counterstained with 2 μg/ml DAPI (Beyotime, 
Shanghai,  China).  Images  were  obtained  under  a  fluorescence  micro-
scope (Leica Microsystems GmbH).

2.6. Cell proliferation assays 

2.8. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays 

◦

For  cell  cycle  analysis,  the  stably  transfected  CRC  cells  were  first 
digested with trypsin, and fixed in 75% ice-cold ethanol for more than 
C. Next, cells were washed with PBS twice and then incubated 
24 h at 4
◦
C for 20 min. Then, 2 μl propi-
with 100 μl RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) at 37
dium  iodide  was  added  to  the  suspension  and  incubated  at  37
C  for 
another 20 min. The cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometry (BD 
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) [33]. 

◦

For apoptosis analysis, collected cells were washed twice with PBS 
and resuspended in 100 ul PBS. Cells were stained in the dark with an 
Annexin  V-fluorescein  isothiocyanate  (FITC)/PI  kit  (BD  Biosciences, 
USA)  for  15  min  at  room  temperature.  Apoptosis  was  immediately 
examined by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) [33]. 
The CRC cells were pretreated with 50 μM of the caspase inhibitor Z- 
VAD-FMK  (Beyotime,  shanghai,  China)  for  24  h.  After  treatment,  the 
apoptosis levels were determined using the same methodology described 
above. 

2.9. Cell migration and invasion assays 

The 8 μm pore size chambers (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were 
used  to  evaluate  cell  migration  and  invasion  capacities  as  described 
previously [37]. For migration assay, collected cells were resuspended in 
serum-free medium and added to the upper compartment (5 × 104 cells). 
The lower chamber contained 700 μl DMEM medium containing 10% 
fetal  bovine  serum.  For  invasion  assay,  the  Matrigel  (BD  Biosciences, 
diluted  at  1:8)  was  precoated  on  the  upper  compartment.  After  incu-
bation (LOVO for 36 h, HCT116 and SW480 for 48 h), cells were fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained for 30 min with 1% 
crystal violet. Cells on the upper side of the chamber were wiped away 
gently.  Photographed  with  a  phase-contrast  microscope  (Leica  Micro-
systems,  Germany)  after  fixation  and  staining,  migrated  cells  were 
counted. 

Cell proliferation was measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) 
(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Stably transfected CRC cells were inocu-
lated into 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells per well and cultured 
◦
at 37 
C in 5% CO2. The CCK-8 reagent was added at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, 
and the samples were incubated for 2 h. Each sample's absorbance value 
was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Infinite 2000 PRO, 
TECAN, Switzerland) [37]. 

2.10. Wound healing assays 

Cells  were  cultured  in  6-well  plates  at  a  density  of  5  × 105/well. 
When  the  degree  of  cell  confluence  reached  90%,  cell  layers  were 
carefully wounded with pipette tips. Cells were washed with PBS and 
added serum-free medium. Cell migration distance was photographed 
with a phase-contrast micrographs (Leica Microsystems, Germany) at 0, 
24 and 48 h [38]. 

2.7. Colony formation assays 

2.11. Western blotting 

Colony  formation  assays  were  performed  as  previously  describe 
[33]. The stably transfected CRC cells were inoculated into 6-well plates 
at a density of 1000 per well and cultured at 37 
C in 5% CO2 for two 
weeks.  The  cells  were  fixed  with  4%  paraformaldehyde  (Beyotime, 
Shanghai, China) for 30 min, stained with 1% crystal violet blue solution 
(Beyotime,  Shanghai,  China)  at  room  temperature  for  30 min,  and 
washed three times with PBS. The numbers of clones (> 50 cells/colony) 
were  counted  with  an  inverted  phase  contrast  microscope  (Leica 
Microsystems, Germany). 

◦

Western blot assays were carried out as described previously [37]. 
Cell lysing was accomplished with the RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, 
China)  containing  1  mM  PMSF  (Beyotime,  Shanghai,  China)  (RIPA: 
PMSF = 100:1) and then total protein extracted. The protein concen-
trations were measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Beyotime, 
Shanghai,  China).  Next,  equal  amounts  of  protein  were  separated  by 
10–12%  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE)  and  transferred  onto  polyvinylidene  difluoride  (PVDF) 
membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes, were firstly

China)  and  raised  in  the  Animal  Experimental  Center  of  Chongqing 
Medical  University  (Chongqing,  China).  Animal  experiments  were 
approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hos-
pital of Chongqing Medical University and conformed with the guide-
lines of the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of 
laboratory animals. The stably transfected HCT116 cells and vector cells 
(5 × 106  cells were resuspended in 200ul PBS) were injected into sub-
cutaneous tissues of nude mice and primary tumor size was measured 
every 3 days after 7 days of injection. Tumor volumes were calculated by 
the following formula: V = (length × width2)/2. The mice were sacri-
ficed after 28 days and tumors removed for further analysis [32]. 

2.13. Data statistics 

Statistical analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 software 
and SPSS 20.0 (USA). Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA)  was  used  to  analyze  the  differences  between  groups.  All  in 
vitro experiments were independently performed at least three times. 
Data are shown as mean ± SD. P-value<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 

3. Results 

3.1. In vitro data 

3.1.1. CPT2 is frequently downregulated in human CRC tissues 

In  order  to  determine  CPT2  expression  in  CRC,  the  data  sets 
GSE87211 and GSE44076 associated with CRC were downloaded from 
GEO  database,  as  well  as  the  CRC  data  set  from  TCGA  database. 

Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the CPT2 mRNA level was signif-
icantly lower in the cancer tissues compared to the normal tissues (P <
0.001)  (Fig.  1A-D).  To  validate  this,  IHC  staining  found  that  the 
immunoreactivity of CPT2 was lower on CRC tissues (n = 40) compared 
to cancer-adjacent normal tissues (n = 40) (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1E, G) and 
IF staining showed that CPT2 expression location was in the cytoplasm 
(Fig. 1F). Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis performed on our own sam-
ples indicated that CPT2 mRNA was lower in CRC tissues (n = 30) than 
paired cancer-adjacent normal tissues (n = 30) (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1H). 
Finally, western blotting also showed that CPT2 protein was obviously 
lower in CRC tissues (n = 20) than paired cancer-adjacent normal tissues 
(n = 20) (Fig. 1I). These results showed that mRNA and protein levels of 
CPT2 were significantly downregulated in CRC tissues. 

3.1.2. Downregulated CPT2 is correlated with clinicopathologic features 
and is an independent predictor of CRC patient prognosis 

To evaluate the clinical significance of CPT2, we analyzed the rela-
tionship between CPT2 expression and clinicopathological characteris-
tics of CRC patients from TCGA. The results demonstrated that the CPT2 
mRNA levels in tumor tissues were significantly different in different age 
(P  = 0.038) (Fig.  2A),  distant  metastasis  (P = 0.002) (Fig.  2C),  TMN 
stages  (P  = 0.003)  (Fig.  2D),  lymph  node  metastasis  (P  = 0.004) 
(Fig.  2E).  However,  it  was  not  associated  with  gender  (P  = 0.969) 
(Fig.  2B)  and  T  stage  (P  = 0.17)  (Fig.  2F).  CPT2  expression  was 
decreased  in  advanced  CRC  and  was  negatively  associated  with  age, 
distant  metastasis,  TNM  stage  and  lymph  node  metastasis,  indicating 
CPT2 may be related to the progression of CRC. In GSE14333 (P = 0.01) 
(Fig. 2G), GSE17536 (P = 0.0241) (Fig. 2H) and TCGA (P = 0.0127) 
(Fig.  2I),  Kaplan-Meier  analysis  showed  that  patients  with  low

expression  of  CPT2  had  a  shorter  survival  time  than  those  with  high 
expression. The results from Chi-square test demonstrated that age (P =
0.038),  lymph  node  metastasis  (P  = 0.007),  distant  metastasis  (P  =
0.031) and TMN stage (P = 0.006) were associated with CPT2 mRNA 
expression  (Table  2).  Subsequently,  univariate  and  multivariate  ana-
lyses  were  conducted  to  identify  the  risk  factors  correlated  with  the 
prognosis  of  CRC  patients  (Table  3).  Univariate  analysis  showed  that 
age, TNM stage, T stage, distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis and 
CPT2 expression were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate Cox 
regression analyses indicated that CPT2 expression, age and T stage can 
be independent predictors for CRC patients and that low CPT2 expres-
sion may be associated with a poorer OS. Together, these results indi-
cated  a  significant  correlation  of  the  expression  of  CPT2  with  the 
prognosis of CRC. 

3.1.3. CPT2 suppresses the proliferation of CRC cells 

To explore the biological functions of CPT2 in CRC cells processes, 
we verified the differential expression of CPT2 mRNA and protein levels 
in five CRC cell lines and NCM460 cell line by RT-qPCR (Fig. 3A) and 
western blotting (Fig. 3B, C). Because of the relative lower expression of 
CPT2, the lentivirus-CPT2 and blank lentivirus-vector were transfected 
into  HCT116  and  SW480  cells  to  overexpress  CPT2.  The  transfection 
efficiency was confirmed by RT-qPCR (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3D) and western 
blotting (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3E, F). CCK-8 assay demonstrated that over-
expression  CPT2  markedly  inhibited  the  proliferation  of  HCT116  and 
SW480  cells (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3G). The colony formation experiment 
showed that the number of colonies in the CPT2 groups was much lower 
than that in the Vector groups (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3H). These results indi-
cated that CPT2 may play a tumor suppressor to suppress proliferation in 
CRC cells. 

3.1.4. CPT2 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells 

Cell  proliferation  inhibition  is  affected  by  cell  cycle  arrest  and 
apoptosis. To explore the underlying mechanism which CPT2 inhibits 
CRC cells growth, we analyzed the effects of CPT2 on cell cycle distri-
bution  by  flow  cytometry  using  stably  overexpressed  HCT116  and 
SW480  cells.  Results  found  that  stably  overexpressed  CPT2  groups 
significantly increased the proportion of G1 phase cells of the HCT116 
(P < 0.001) and SW480 cell lines (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3I). Flow cytometry

analysis also showed that the CPT2 groups significantly increased the 
percentage of apoptotic cells in the HCT116 (P < 0.01) and SW480 cell 
lines (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3J), compared with the Vector groups. 

3.1.5. CPT2 represses migration and invasion of CRC cells through 
inhibition of EMT 

To determine whether CPT2 can affect CRC cells migration and in-
vasion. Firstly, we observed that the cell morphology was changed in the 
stably overexpressed HCT116 and SW480 cells (Fig. 4A), presenting a 
more adhesive contact pattern while the Vector groups cells still showed 
scattered distribution, which indicating that CPT2 may be involved in 
tumor  cells  epithelial  mesenchymal  transition  (EMT).  The  effects  of 
CPT2  on  CRC  cells  migration  and  invasion  abilities  were  further 
analyzed  by  transwell  assays.  The  results  showed  that  CPT2  over-
expression  significantly  decreased  the  numbers  of  migrating  and 
invading cells (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4C). Then, we performed wound healing 
assays. Results showed that stably transfected CPT2 cells migrated into 
wounded areas more slowly than the Vector groups cells at 48 h (P <
0.001) (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we further analyzed the correlation be-
tween the mRNA expression of CPT2 and EMT signaling pathway target 
genes using TCGA data. We found that there was significantly positive 
correlation  of  CPT2  with  CDH1  (P  < 0.001)  and  were  the  negative 
correlation of CPT2 with CDH2 (P < 0.001), VIM (P < 0.001) and SNAI1 
(P < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Western blotting showed that the inhibitory effect 
of CPT2 on CRC cells metastasis was mediated by the upregulation of E- 
cadherin (CDH1) and downregulation of N-cadherin (CDH2), Vimentin 
(VIM) and Snail (SNAI1) (Fig. 4E, F). In order to explore whether the 
effect  of  cell  migration  and  invasion  come  from  apoptosis,  we  added 
apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) to CRC cells that 
stably overexpressed CPT2 and found that the effect of CPT2 induced 
apoptosis could be restored by Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. S1, A). Then, we per-
formed transwell assays. After migrating 24 h, we found that the number 
of penetrating cells in both the CPT2 group and the CPT2 + Z-DAV-FMK 
group  were  significantly  lower  than  that  cells  in  the  Vector  group 
(Fig. S1, B, C). Interestingly, CCK-8 assays showed that overexpression 
of CPT2 did not significantly change the absorbance of CRC cells at 24 h 
compared  with  the  control  group,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3G.  In  summary, 
these results indicated that the changes of CRC cell migration and in-
vasion are mainly regulated by CPT2 inhibiting EMT, rather than from 
the effects of proliferation and apoptosis. 

3.1.6. Knockdown of CPT2 promotes growth, metastasis, invasion and 
inhibits apoptosis of CRC cells 

To further assess the function of CPT2 on CRC cells, we assessed the 
effect of CPT2 through siRNA knockdown of CPT2 in LOVO cell line. RT- 
qPCR (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5A) and western blotting (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5B, C) 
showed  that  the  highest  knockdown  efficiency  was  exhibited  by 
siCPT2–3. Knockdown of CPT2, compared with siCtrl treatment, mark-
edly increased LOVO cell viability, as examined by CCK8 (P < 0.001) 
(Fig. 5D) and colony formation assays (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5E). We further 
used  flow  cytometry  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  CPT2  on  cell  cycle  and 
apoptosis. Knockdown of CPT2 significantly decreased the proportion of 
G1 phase cells and increased S phase cells of LOVO cell line (P < 0.001) 
(Fig. 5F). The percentage of apoptosis in LOVO cells was significantly 
decreased after CPT2 knockdown (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5G). Then, transwell 
assay showed that the number of migrated and invaded LOVO cells was 
dramatically higher after CPT2 knockdown, compared with that in the 
siCtrl group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5H, I). Moreover, we performed wound 
healing  assay. The results  showed that  CPT2 knockdown  groups cells 
migrated into wounded areas more quickly than the siCtrl groups cells at 
48 h (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5J, K). Western blotting showed that knockdown of 
CPT2 in LOVO cells upregulated the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin 
and  Snail,  concurrently  downregulated  the  expression  of  E-cadherin 
(Fig.  5L,  M).  These  results  indicated  that  knockdown  of  CPT2  was 
beneficial to the progression of CRC.

3.1.7. Effect of CPT2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis is related to p53 
pathway 

(p  = 0.048) 

The crucial role of CPT2 in CRC progression energized us to find the 
downstream  genes  regulated  by  CPT2.  Firstly,  in  order  to  determine 
which  pathway  may  be  involved  in  CPT2-mediated  CRC  progression, 
GSEA  analysis  was  applied  in  TCGA  data.  Results  revealed  that 
(Fig.  6A),  KEGG_-
KEGG_COLORECTAL_CANCER 
P53_SINGALING_PATHWAY (p = 0.024) (Fig. 6B), KEGG_APOPTOSIS (p 
= 0.012) (Fig. 6C), KEGG_NUCLEOTIDE_EXCISION_REPAIR (p = 0.033) 
(Fig. 6D) gene sets were enriched in the high-CPT2-expression group. As 
the p53 signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of 
tumor  progression,  we  speculated  that  CPT2  may  regulate  colorectal 
tumorigenesis by the p53 signaling pathway. So, we further analyzed the 
correlation between the mRNA expression of CPT2 and p53 signaling 
target  genes  using  TCGA  data  (Fig.  6E).  We  found  that  there  was 
significantly positive correlation of CPT2 with p53 (P < 0.001) and the 
correlation between CPT2 and p53 signaling downstream target genes, 
such as p21 (P = 0.004), MDM2 (P < 0.001), BAX (P < 0.001), BCL2 (P 
< 0.001),  CASP3  (P  < 0.001),  CASP9  (P  < 0.001)  and  PARP1  (P  <
0.001),  were  also  very  significant.  To  explore  how  CPT2  affects  the 
expression  and  activity  of  p53,  we  performed  RT-qPCR  and  western 
blotting analyses. The results showed that p53 expression was signifi-
cantly increased at mRNA levels following overexpression of CPT2 in 
HCT116 (P < 0.05) and SW480 (P < 0.01) cells, decreased in LOVO cells 
after  knockdown  of  CPT2  expression  (P  < 0.05)  (Fig.  6F).Western 
blotting  showed  CPT2  transfection  elevated  the  total  p53  and  phos-
phorylated  p53  (p-p53)  expression  remarkably  (P  < 0.05),  while 
knockdown of CPT2 obtained the opposite results (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6G, 
H). These results indicated that the interference of CPT2 activated the 
phosphorylation activity of p53 and increased the expression of p53. We 
also  found the expression  of p21 was dramatically increased  in CPT2 
group,  which  is  the  key  G1  cell  cycle  regulator  and  p53  downstream 
target  gene  [39].  In  the  CPT2  groups,  the  expression  of  MDM2,  an 
important  negative  regulator  of  p53,  was  lower  than  that  in  Vector 
groups.  To  further  explore  the  apoptotic  effect  of  CPT2  in  CRC  cells, 
western  blotting  showed  that  CPT2  overexpression  significantly 
increased expressions  of Bax, cleaved caspase9, cleaved caspase3 and 
cleaved PARP, and decreased expression of Bcl2. The total caspase9 and 
total  caspase3  protein  levels  were  unaffected  compared  with  Vector 
groups. Whereas, the knockdown of CPT2 in LOVO cells produced the 
opposite changes the expression of p53 target genes (Fig. 6I, J). These 
results  revealed  that  CPT2  influenced  CRC  cells  proliferation  and 
apoptosis through p53 pathway. 

3.2. In vivo data 

3.2.1. CPT2 inhibits xenograft tumor growth 

showed that the average volume (P < 0.001) (Fig. 7C) and weight (P <
0.01) (Fig. 7D) of tumors in Vector group were significantly higher than 
the CPT2 group. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and IHC staining were carried 
out to analyze tumor features and CPT2 expression of the xenografts in 
nude  mice.  Ki-67  staining  and  TUNEL  analyses  were  carried  out  to 
evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. We observed that 
tumor cells with frequent nuclear fragmentation in CPT2 group, along 
with  increased  in  CPT2  staining,  decreased  in  Ki-67  staining  and 
increased  in  cell  apoptosis  (Fig.  7E,  F).  Finally,  western  blotting 
demonstrated  an  increase  in  the  expression  of  apoptosis-related  pro-
teins,  including  p53,  Bax,  Cleaved  caspase-9,  Cleaved  caspase-3  and 
Cleaved  PARP  in  CPT2  group,  while  Bcl2  was  decreased  (Fig.  7G). 
Together, these results indicated that CPT2 may partially inhibit CRC 
tumorigenesis via p53 pathway in vivo. 

4. Discussion 

CRC development is characterized by a multistep process involving a 
series  of  histological  and  morphological  changes  triggered  by  a 
sequential accumulation of specific genomic alterations [40]. Therefore, 
identification of genes associated with the occurrence and development 
of colorectal cancer may contribute to diagnosis and treatment. Previous 
studies have reported that CPT2 was frequently downregulated in HCC 
tissues and promoted the occurrence, development and chemoresistance 
of  HCC  [28,29].  Consistently,  CPT2  was  downregulation  in  OC  and 
significantly  associated  with  poor  survival.  In  addition,  the  down-
regulation  of  CPT2  promotes  OC  proliferation  and  metastasis  via 
inducing  ROS/NFκB  pathway  [31].  So,  CPT2  is  an  important  gene 
associated with several cancers. However, the biological functions and 
molecular mechanisms of CPT2 in CRC remains unknown. 

In  this  study,  we  demonstrated  that  CPT2  was  frequently  down-
regulated in CRC tissues and was highly correlated with several clini-
copathological  indicators  such  as  distant  metastasis,  lymph  node 
metastasis  and  TNM  stage.  Downregulated  CPT2  was  significantly 
associated with poor survival for CRC patients and CPT2 expression can 
be an independent predictor of CRC. Consistently, a previous study on 
rectal cancer pointed out that CPT2 was a protective prognostic factor 
for CRC patients [41]. Moreover, we further investigated the function of 
CPT2 as a tumor suppressor in CRC growth and metastasis. Functional 
studies  had  shown  that  CPT2  overexpression  inhibited  cell  growth, 
colony formation, migration, invasion and xenotransplantation of CRC 
cells,  as  well  as  induced  cell  cycle  arrest  in  G1  phase  and  apoptosis. 
While CPT2 knockdown contributed to cell proliferation, migration and 
invasion, increased the proportion of S phase cells, decreased the pro-
portion  of  G1  phase  cells  and  inhibited  apoptosis.  All  these  results 
indicated that CPT2 may play a very important role in the occurrence 
and development of CRC. 

To  investigate  whether  CPT2  plays  an  anti-oncogene  role  in  vivo, 
nude mice were subcutaneously injected with HCT116 cells treated with 
either CPT2 overexpression vector or empty vector (Fig. 7A, B). Results 

EMT is a biological process in which epithelial cells are transformed 
into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype through specific procedures 
[42]. EMT plays a crucial role in the metastasis of CRC [43]. E-cadherin,

N-cadherin and Vimentin are important epithelial markers and Snail is a 
key transcription factor of EMT [44,45]. Most EMT transcription factors 
are  transcriptional  repressors  including  Snail,  Slug  and  Twist.  They 
repress  epithelial-specific  genes  involved  in  stabilizing  cell–cell  junc-
tions  (such  as  E-cadherin),  and  increase  components  of  the  mesen-
chymal migratory machinery [46].In this study, we demonstrated that 
CPT2 overexpression inhibited the invasion and migration of CRC cells 

and markedly increased E-cadherin expression and reduced N-cadherin, 
Vimentin, and Snail expression, while CPT2 knockdown yielded oppo-
site results. As a master regulator of metastasis, p53 directly controls the 
transcription  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  key  metastasis  pathways, 
including  cell  adhesion,  motility,  invasion,  EMT,  stemness,  ECM  in-
teractions,  and  anoikis  [46].  We  also  found  that  CPT2  activated  p53 
expression.  Activation  of  p53  in  colorectal  cells  acquires  a  more

epithelial  phenotype  by  initiating  mesenchymal  epithelial  transition 
(MET). Furthermore, p53 has been found to play an important role in the 
maintenance of the epithelial phenotype by regulated independently the 
expression of E-cadherin and cell invasion [47]. p53 signaling impacts 
transcription  factors  levels  to  negatively  regulate  EMT.  For  example, 
activation of p53 down-regulates Snail by inducing miR-34 expression 
[48].  In  addition,  p53  also  promotes  MDM2-mediated  degradation  of 
Slug to increase E-cadherin expression and oppose EMT [49]. All in all, 
these  results  suggested  that  CPT2  might  negatively  regulate  EMT  by 
activating  p53,  thereby  inhibiting  the  migration  and  invasion of  CRC 
cells. 

Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying 
effects of CPT2 on CRC. We found that p53 pathway may be involved in 
the function of CPT2 in CRC cells. As a master regulator of DNA repli-
cation  and  cell division,  p53 arrests  cell  cycle and  induces apoptosis, 
thereby inhibiting cancer development [50]. p21 is a major target of p53 
activity and can be directly activated to induce the cell cycle arrest at G1 
phase [39,51]. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase enzyme of the p53 pro-
tein and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination can promotes p53 degradation 
[52]. Study pointed that inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction may be a 
new  strategy  for  cancer  treatment  [53,54].  Interestingly,  our  results 
showed  that  CPT2  markedly  upregulated  p53  and  P21,  inactivated 

CellularSignalling92(2022)11026712F. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

MDM2 in CPT2 overexpression CRC cells. Meanwhile, the opposite re-
sults were obtained in CPT2 knockdown CRC cells. These results sug-
gested that CPT2 inhibited cancer cell proliferation may involve in p53 
pathway activation. 

In  multicellular organisms,  apoptosis is  the  universal  form of  pro-
grammed  cell  death  and  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  development  and 
homeostasis [55]. Two major apoptotic pathways have been described 
in  cells,  including  the  death  receptor  pathway  and  the  mitochondrial 
pathway, and p53 has been shown to contribute to the activation of both 
[7,56].  Mitochondrial  apoptosis  pathways  are  controlled  by  the  large 
family of Bcl-2-related proteins, enclosing antiapoptotic (such as Bcl-2, 
Bcl-xl, Bcl-w, Mcl-1), proapoptotic (such as Bax, Bak, Bok) and proap-
optotic  BH3-only  proteins  (such  as  Bad,  Bik,  Bid,  Bim,  Noxa,  Puma) 
[57]. Bax and Bak central effectors of apoptosis as they form macropores 
in the mitochondria outer membrane causing MOMP, while Bcl-2 can 
block membrane recruitment and integration of Bax, even in the pres-
ence of a Bax-activating signal [58,59]. Previous study has shown that 
the  ratio  of Bcl-2/Bax  constituted a  rheostat that set  the  threshold of 
susceptibility  to  apoptosis  for  the  intrinsic  pathway,  which  amplified 
death signals by utilizing organelles such as the mitochondrion [55]. In 
vitro  and  vivo,  we  examined  and  found  that  overexpression  of  CPT2 
increased  the  p53  expression,  leading  to  proapoptotic  proteins  Bax, 
cleaved  caspase-9,  cleaved  caspase-3  and  cleaved  PARP  upregulated, 
but antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 repressed. Proapoptotic protein Bax is the 
classical target for direct regulation by the p53 tumor suppressor protein 
and mediates MOMP and apoptosis [60,61]. The activation of Bax causes 
the MOMP and the cytochrome C release. Then, cytochrome C combines 
with Apaf–1 and procaspase-9 to produce apoptosome. Apoptosome is a 
multimeric complex involving Apaf-1, cytochrome C, and the cofactor 
dATP/ATP,  which  triggers  caspase  9  and  leads  to  caspase  cascade 
[8,62,63]. Caspase-3 is cleaved and activated by caspase-9. Caspase-3 
act as executioners in apoptosis, and once it was activated, cleavage of 
its precursor forms occurs [14]. PARP is the target protein of caspase-3, 
affecting  the  DNA  repair  of  cancer  cells.  PARP  cleavage  is  frequently 
observed in cells undergoing apoptosis and is recognized as a marker for 
caspase-3  activation  [14,64].  Activated  caspase-3  cleaves  PARP  and 
prevents  DNA  from  repairing  itself  and  finally  leads  to  apoptosis.  In 
vitro, knockdown of CPT2 downregulated of Bax and upregulated Bcl2 
by  regulating the  transcription  of  p53, thereby  inhibiting  MOMP  and 
apoptosis in CRC cells. Based on the good in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor 
effects of CPT2 in CRC cells, which suggested that CPT2 may be a po-
tential  anti-colorectal  cancer  agent  by  the  p53-dependent  apoptotic 
pathway. 

In  conclusion,  we  provide  evidences  showing  that  CPT2,  which  is 
lowly expressed in CRC tissues and can be an independent predictor of 
CRC patient prognosis. Overexpression of CPT2 inhibited the prolifera-
tion, migration, and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of 
CRC cells in vitro, knockdown of CPT2 produced the opposite results. 
Similarly, overexpression of CPT2 reduced tumor growth in vivo. More 
importantly,  we  found  that  CPT2  can  regulate  the  proliferation  and 
apoptosis  of  CRC  cells  via  p53  pathway.  CPT2  may  be  a  diagnostic 
marker  of  CRC  and  strategies  targeting  CPT2  may  be  developed  as 
therapies for CRC.
