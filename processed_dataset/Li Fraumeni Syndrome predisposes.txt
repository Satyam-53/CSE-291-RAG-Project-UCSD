Abstract
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), caused by germline pathogenic variants in TP53, predisposes to a wide range of young-onset 
malignancies, particularly sarcoma, breast and brain cancer. More recently, an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma 
has been recognised, although uptake of surveillance upper endoscopy is unclear. Our retrospective review of 65 patients 
with LFS, of whom 53.8% had undergone endoscopy, identified four patients (6.2%) with gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) 
adenocarcinomas. Two cases were found on asymptomatic screening and were early stage. No cases had family history of 
gastrointestinal malignancy. Reviewing genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, 76.4% of sporadic esophageal 
adenocarcinomas harboured somatic TP53 pathogenic variants, compared with 39.9% of non-cardia gastric cancers. This 
similar pattern observed in germline and sporadic cases warrants further investigation. We propose that upper endoscopy be 
recommended to all patients with LFS, with a focus on appropriate surveillance of the GEJ.

Introduction

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is defined by germline patho-
genic variants in the tumour suppressor gene TP53 and is 
associated with increased rates of many different malignan-
cies, some with up to 100% lifetime risk without appropriate 
intervention [1]. While the strongest associations have been 
demonstrated with sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumours 
and adrenocortical carcinomas, the increased risk of colo-
rectal and, more recently, gastric adenocarcinomas have 
also been acknowledged [2]. The relative risk of esophageal 
cancer is less well characterised with conflicting reports [1, 
3]. An analysis of the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer database identified 0.5% of individuals with esopha-
geal cancer (15/3043) and 3.3% (101/3043) with gastric can-
cer [3, 4]. Gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) tumours arise at

the histological transition between esophagus and stomach, 
and the commonly used Siewert classification divides GEJ 
adenocarcinomas into three categories for which oncological 
management differs: Type 1 arising from distal esophagus 
(1 to 5 cm proximal to GEJ), Type 2 located at the true junc-
tion (between 1 cm proximal to 2 cm distal of the GEJ) and 
Type 3 located 2 to 5 cm distal to the GEJ [5]. In contrast, 
the American Joint Committee on Cancer stages all GEJ 
tumors with epicentre ≤ 2 cm into the proximal stomach as 
esophageal cancers and those > 2 cm as gastric cancers [5]. 
Consequently, GEJ tumors have been variably categorised 
in the literature as esophageal, gastric or a separate entity.

In this context, expert consensus guidelines differ in their 
recommendations for upper endoscopy, or esophagogas-
troduodenoscopy, screening in LFS: North American guide-
lines support upper endoscopy every 2–5 years from the age 
of 25 alongside colonoscopy, while European guidelines do 
not routinely recommend upper endoscopy screening [2, 6]. 
The uptake of these recommendation is also unclear.

There is a biological basis to suspect pathogenic vari-
ants in TP53 as a driver of upper gastrointestinal cancers. 
The Cancer Genome Atlas Program classified 559 sporadic 
esophageal and gastric cancers into distinct molecular phe-
notypes. When analysing adenocarcinoma, four subclasses 
were identified, but only one, a chromosomal instability

(CIN) subclass, accounted for the vast majority of lower 
esophagus and GEJ tumours [7]. CIN molecular subgroup 
accounted for 49% of adenocarcinomas from esophagus and 
stomach and was characterised by ERBB2 amplification, 
VEGFA amplification and, importantly, pathogenic variants 
in TP53.

The familial cancer centre at our institution offers a dedi-
cated gastrointestinal risk management clinic for patients 
with  high-risk  genetic  predisposition  to  gastrointestinal 
malignancy, and we routinely offer upper endoscopy at the 
same time as colonoscopy to patients with LFS. We sought 
to assess the rates of upper gastrointestinal cancers and their 
characteristics in our cohort, with comparison to results 
from the TCGA cohort.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of adult patients 
with clinical class 4 or 5 germline pathogenic variants in 
TP53 managed by our centre between January 2000 to May 
2023. Data regarding demographics, personal and family 
history of malignancy, duration of follow-up, and endo-
scopic/histologic results of upper and lower endoscopies 
were collected. Further clinical details were collated for 
cases of GEJ tumours. Ethical approval was obtained from 
the institutional human ethics committee (Project number: 
PMC97246, 29 May 2023).

Separately, data of each subject analysed in the TCGA 
study to characterise the molecular characteristics of spo-
radic esophageal and gastric cancers was obtained from 
the supplementary table in the initial publication. Corre-
sponding details of pathogenic variants in TP53 were then 
obtained from the openly available dataset on cBioportal 
(accessed 27 June 2023) [7, 8]. From 559 subjects, 90 esoph-
ageal squamous cell cancers, 13 gastric adenocarcinomas of

decision was made for early repeat surveillance at 18 months 
revealing subsequent carcinoma in situ. No cases of can-
cer were associated with prior family history of digestive 
tract malignancy, or abdominal radiotherapy. Furthermore, 
five patients undergoing screening (14.3% of those who 
had upper endoscopy) were diagnosed with a premalignant 
lesion (Barrett’s esophagus, non-Helicobacter associated 
gastric intestinal metaplasia and a proximal fundic gland 
polyp with low grade dysplasia).

On review of the data for these patients from the TCGA 
paper via cBioportal, we found that amongst esophageal 
or probable esophageal adenocarcinomas, 76.4% (55/72) 
had somatic pathogenic variants in TP53, with decreasing 
prevalence in the indeterminate GEJ (22/36, 61.1%), gastric/
probable gastric GEJ (29/63, 46.0%) and gastric non-cardia 
(113/283, 39.9%) adenocarcinoma groups (Fig. 2).

Discussion

It  is  still  not  globally  recognised  that  upper  endoscopy 
should  be  a  routine  component  of  surveillance  in  LFS. 
Moreover, in most guidelines recommending upper endos-
copy, the focus has been on gastric adenocarcinoma, per-
haps because some reports have presumably grouped GEJ 
cancers with gastric cancers [9], even though some cases 
are better characterised as esophageal or a distinct entity [5, 
7]. The distinction is important as inspection of the gastric 
mucosa is performed within the stomach and on retroflexion 
during upper endoscopy, while the GEJ is best assessed in 
forward-view.

Our findings suggest that the GEJ and lower esophagus 
may be a particularly vulnerable region in LFS, in keep-
ing with the molecular phenotyping seen in sporadic GEJ 
tumours. While it has been suggested that Asian carriers 
may be at higher risk than non-Asian carriers, and that risk 
of both gastric and colon cancers may run in families [9, 
10], the risk in our cohort was not isolated to these specific 
groups. Both cases seen on surveillance were early stage, 
facilitating likely curative resection. This data suggests a 
harmonisation of germline and somatic observations that 
are highly suggestive of a biological effect of p53 involv-
ing the GEJ. There are limitations to the data given this 
is a retrospective analysis of a cohort of LFS, but the high 
prevalence of GEJ cancer in this group is compelling and 
warrants a prospective evaluation in patients who carry ger-
mline pathogenic variants of TP53.

Additionally, premalignant lesions in the upper gastro-
intestinal tract appeared relatively frequently in our cohort. 
Given the presence of gastric intestinal metaplasia in four 
of the five individuals with premalignant lesions, we would 
also endorse routine biopsy of the gastric antrum and body

unclear location and 2 undifferentiated esophageal tumours 
were excluded. The remaining 454 cases of adenocarcinoma 
were then subdivided based on subtype (esophageal/prob-
able esophageal GEJ adenocarcinoma, indeterminate GEJ 
adenocarcinoma, gastric/probable gastric GEJ adenocar-
cinoma) and proportion of cases with somatic pathogenic 
variants in TP53 calculated.

Results

Sixty-five with LFS (57% female, mean at diagnosis 34.5, 
median follow-up 51 months) seen via the high-risk cancer 
genetics clinic over the study period, 35 (53.8%) of whom 
had at least one upper endoscopy. Four patients (6.2%) were 
diagnosed with cancer at the GEJ (Table 1), with no cancers 
elsewhere in the upper digestive tract and one separate case 
of colorectal cancer on colonoscopy. Two cases, a White 
man and North-East Asian woman in their 30s, were asymp-
tomatic and undergoing screening, at their second and first 
procedures respectively. Both cancers were at early stage 
allowing for resection with curative intent. The lesions were 
subtle and best appreciated on close inspection of the GEJ 
in forward-view (Fig. 1). In the former case, index upper 
endoscopy revealed moderate reflux esophagitis (Los Ange-
les Classification grade B) with no dysplasia on biopsy, but a

Li Fraumeni Syndrome predisposes to gastro-esophageal junction tumours  

33

and eradication of Helicobacter pylori if present, similar to 
recommendations for Lynch Syndrome [11].

The optimal interval for upper endoscopy also requires 
further study. The progression from reflux esophagitis to 
carcinoma in situ occurred in 18 months in one case, and 
a longer surveillance interval may have led to a later stage 
diagnosis. Notably, this finding would not have been rou-
tinely followed-up in a patient with no germline pathogenic 
variant in TP53. It may therefore be reasonable for any endo-
scopic finding at index procedure to be followed-up at two 
years, and subsequent follow-up guided by the progression 
or resolution of the changes. Our practice, in the absence 
of data, is for patients with other risk factors such as family 
history of gastrointestinal malignancy or abdominal radio-
therapy to undergo two to three yearly surveillance, gen-
erally coinciding with colonoscopy. Patients with normal 
index upper endoscopy and no other risk factors undergo 
surveillance every five years.

We believe our novel clinical observations provide prac-
tice-changing evidence for all clinicians caring for patients 
with germline pathogenic variants of TP53 and we would 
advocate for routine endoscopic surveillance in all cases, 
with particular focus on the GEJ.
