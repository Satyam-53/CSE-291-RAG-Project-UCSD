The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor involved in a variety of crucial
cellular functions, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. Still, a
growing number of studies indicate that p53 plays multiple roles in
spermatogenesis, as well as in the occurrence and development of male
infertility. The representative functions of p53 in spermatogenesis include the
proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), spermatogonial differentiation,
spontaneous apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. p53 is involved in various male
infertility-related diseases. Innovative therapeutic strategies targeting p53 have
emerged in recent years. This review focuses on the role of p53 in
spermatogenesis and male infertility and analyses the possible underlying
mechanism involved. All these conclusions may provide a new perspective on
drug intervention targeting p53 for male infertility treatment.

1 Introduction

Infertility is deﬁned as the failure to conceive after 12 months or more of regular,
unprotected sexual intercourse (1). Infertility is a major health problem and social
challenge, particularly in an era of low fertility and an aging society (2). The incidence
of infertility is estimated to be 12.6%-17.5% among reproductive-aged couples worldwide,
and males are responsible for approximately half of all infertility problems (3). In recent
years, the increasing prevalence of male infertility has attracted global attention. An
analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 showed that the global prevalence of
male infertility increased signiﬁcantly, by 76.9%, from 1990 to 2019, along with a steady
growth trend in the global burden of male infertility diseases (4). Multiple studies have
shown worldwide decreases in sperm counts (5–7). A recent systematic review by Levine
et al. (8) revealed that the total sperm count declined by 62.3% between 1973 and 2018, and
this decrease has accelerated since 2000. Various causes involved in male infertility have
been discussed, mainly including congenital factors (e.g., genetic abnormalities, congenital
bilateral absence of the vas deferens, and cryptorchidism), acquired factors (e.g., varicocele,
testicular torsion, and genital inﬂammation), and idiopathic risk factors (e.g., smoking,
obesity, and aging) (9). Although signiﬁcant progress has been made within the past few

decades, a considerable proportion of cases of male infertility are
diagnosed as idiopathic or unexplained, which means that the
underlying mechanisms have not yet been revealed (10). There
has also been little progress in drug therapy in the past decade (11).
Although the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) can
bring dawn to infertile men, it is not always a panacea, and its
safety has been questioned because of comorbidities in the offspring
(12). Therefore, research on male infertility has become a
global endeavor.

The tumor suppressor protein p53, encoded by TP53 in human
and by Tp53 in mice, is a vital regulator of the cellular stress
response and a crucial controller of cell fate (13). p53 contains ﬁve
domains: (1) the transactivation domain (TAD), which is
responsible for gene transcription; (2) the proline-rich domain
(PRD), which is crucial for p53 stability; (3) the DNA-binding
domain (DBD), which is required for DNA binding activity; (4) the
tetramerization domain (TD), which is needed for tetramerization
of p53; and (5) the C-terminal domain, which is responsible for
regulating the binding activity between p53 and the DBD and is
inﬂuenced by posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs) of p53 (14).
Among these modiﬁcations, phosphorylation and acetylation
stabilize p53 and increase transcriptional activation, while the
effect of methylation on p53 transcriptional activity varies with
lysine residues (15). Under physiological conditions, p53 is
maintained at a low level mainly due to E3 ligase Mdm2-
mediated ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Under stress
conditions, p53 can be activated by PTMs or reduced degradation
(16). As a transcription factor, p53 is involved in a variety of crucial
cellular functions, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis,
autophagy, senescence, and oxidative stress (14).

Multiple studies have shown that p53 is closely related to many
developmental disorders or diseases, such as stem cell
differentiation, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative
diseases (17–19). In recent years, abundant evidence has indicated
the crucial role of p53 in spermatogenesis and the pathogenesis of
male infertility (20, 21). Excitingly, p53 has proven to be druggable,
and efforts toward the development of p53-based therapy are
emerging (22). Therefore, we summarized the roles of p53 in
spermatogenesis and the mechanisms of p53 in male infertility
diseases, which may provide new strategies for male
infertility therapies.

2 p53 and spermatogenesis

Spermatogenesis is a unique and complex cell cycle process that
is characterized by ﬁne regulation to ensure high-ﬁdelity
transmission of genetic material (23). Three stages are involved in
spermatogenesis (Figure 1): spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)
differentiate into spermatocytes via mitotic proliferation,
spermatocytes transform into spermatids via meiotic division, and
spermatids differentiate into spermatozoa (24). p53 appears to be
indispensable for normal spermatogenesis, a process that includes a
great deal of DNA replication and DNA packaging (25). Here, we
clariﬁed the role of p53 in spermatogenesis (Figure 1).

2.1 The role of p53 in spermatogonia

The maintenance of spermatogenesis throughout the male’s
lifetime relies on SSCs, which possess the ability to self-renew and
differentiate into committed spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs)
(26). SSCs are undifferentiated spermatogonia and a heterogeneous
population. In rodent testes, SSCs can be subdivided into Asingle
(As), Apaired (Apr) and Aaligned (Aal) spermatogonia and can be
distinguished by several genes, including Ngn3, Sox3, Gfra1 and Plzf
(27). Gfra1+ cells (mainly As, Apr, and some Aal) are stem cells that
can transform into Ngn3/Sox3+ (mainly Aal and some Apr)
committed SPCs. The latter differentiate into differentiating
spermatogonia (type A1-A4, intermediate spermatogonia, type B),
thereby entering meiosis after undergoing rapid mitotic division
(28). PLZF (As, Apr, and Aal), whose key function is to maintain an
undifferentiated state by directly repressing the expression of Kit, a
hallmark of spermatogonial differentiation, is crucial for the self-
renewal of SSCs (29, 30). By contrast, human testes contain two
types of distinct A spermatogonia, identiﬁed as Adark and Apale,
based on nuclear morphology. Apale are characterized by self-
renewal and regular proliferation, while Adark are slow cycling.
There are 5 transit amplifying divisions in humans form Adark/Apale
undifferentiated spermatogonia to terminally differentiated sperm,
while 12 transit amplifying divisions exist in rodents from As
spermatogonia to terminally differentiated sperm. However, the
larger pool of stem/progenitor cells partly compensates for fewer
transit-amplifying cell divisions in human testis. Markers of
undifferentiated spermatogonia in human also include GFRa1 and
PLZF. And cKIT is a marker of differentiated spermatogonia in
human testes, too (31).

It has been proven that p53 has multiple effects on
spermatogonia. First, p53 has been shown to participate in the
regulation of SSC proliferation and spermatogonial differentiation
by regulating PLZF. Increased p53 can bind to the Plzf promoter
and negatively regulate Plzf,
leading to a reduction in Plzf
expression and the number of Plzf+ SSCs in mouse testes,
resulting in a decrease in male fertility (32). Interestingly, it has
been reported that PLZF could also act as a transcription repressor
to decrease p53 levels by inhibiting TP53 transcription and
promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 in several
cell lines (33). The interaction between the two proteins might
indicate the ﬁne regulation of p53 in spermatogenesis. Second, p53
plays an important role in the maintenance of SPCs. A study
showed that Csnk1a1, the gene encoded Casein kinase I isoform
alpha (CKI-a), knockout accelerated nuclear p53 protein
expression by disrupting Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in
mouse spermatogonia. Subsequently, activated p53 negatively
regulates Sox3 by binding to the Sox3 promoter, resulting in
decreased Sox3+ progenitor spermatogonia, blocked meiosis, and
ultimately male infertility. As expected, the p53 inhibitor piﬁthrin-a
partially rescued spermatogenesis in CKI-a-null mice (34). Finally,
p53 has been shown to play a role in spermatogonial proliferation
and apoptosis. Germ cells expand through mitosis, and p53-
mediated apoptosis maintains germline homeostasis. Increased
production of differentiating type spermatogonia and decreased

FIGURE 1
The role of p53 in rodent spermatogenesis. SSCs differentiate into progenitor cells, and the latter subsequently differentiate into differentiating
spermatogonia. Differentiating spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes, and spermatocytes produce spermatids via meiotic division.
Afterwards, round spermatids undergo maturation via spermiogenesis to form spermatozoa. Activated p53 can bind to the Plzf promoter and the
Sox3 promoter to negatively regulate Plzf and Sox3, leading to a reduction in the number of Plzf+ SSCs and Sox3+ progenitor spermatogonia.
During normal spermatogenesis, ATM/p53/Bax pathway or ATM/p53/p21 pathway are activated in DNA-damaged germ cells to induce spontaneous
apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, respectively. SSCs, spermatogonial stem cells; DSBs, DNA double-strand breaks.

clearance of lethally damaged differentiating type spermatogonia
can be observed in Tp53 knockout C57BL/6 mouse testes, indicating
the key role of p53 in the regulation of cell proliferation and
apoptosis in normal spermatogonia (35). Mechanistically,
accelerated p53 ubiquitination-mediated degradation and reduced
p53 activity result in a decrease in target molecules cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and apoptosis regulator Bax
levels, and an increase in Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)
level, thereby accelerating the G2/M phase transition, inhibiting
apoptosis and promoting spermatogonial proliferation (36).
However, inconsistent results exist. A study by Dai et al. (25)
revealed a normal and unaffected undifferentiated spermatogonial
population and SSC proliferation rate, accompanied by elevated
spermatocyte death and testicular atrophy in Tp53 knockout rats on
a Sprague-Dawley background. This inconsistency may be related
to the different genetic backgrounds of the animals. In addition, p53
and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor C (p18-INK4c, encoded by
Cdkn2c in mice) collaborate to control the time from the mitosis
phase to meiosis in spermatogonia. p18-INK4c acts as a negative
regulator of the cell cycle at the early G1 phase (37). A study has
shown that Cdkn2c/Tp53 double knockout mice displayed higher
percentage of PCNA (a marker of proliferation expressed in S
phase) -positive tubules compared with that in wild type and
Cdkn2c-null mice, which indicated Cdkn2c/Tp53 double knockout
mice existed active proliferation and continuation of the mitosis
phase in spermatogonia, and thus a delay in meiosis entry (20).
Besides, in this study, Cdkn2c null mice showed a signiﬁcantly
increased sperm counts as compared to Tp53 null or wild type,
while Cdkn2c/Tp53 double knockout mice had much lower sperm

counts, which might attributed to the increased apoptosis induced
by DNA damage secondary to prolongation of meiosis entry (20).
Overall, p53 plays an important role in the differentiation,
proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation of SSCs
and spermatogonia.

2.2 The role of p53 in spermatocytes

A1-type spermatogonia are transformed into preleptotene
spermatocytes after six divisions and subsequently enter meiosis
(38). After meiotic prophase, a prolonged G2 phase that allows a
series of chromosome events with active genetic recombination,
primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I to form secondary
spermatocytes (39). Subsequently, secondary spermatocytes
undergo meiosis II to produce spermatids. The meiosis process
can be divided into the following steps: DNA replication, crossover
recombination, reductional division and equational division (40).
Notably, meiosis is accompanied by DNA replication, DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA damage repair (41). Consequently,
ﬁne control to maintain genomic stability and prevent mutagenesis
is needed to avoid meiotic defects.

As the guardian of the genome, p53 appears to be duty-bound to
respond to DNA damage during spermatogenesis. In contrast to those
in other tissues, p53 levels are signiﬁcantly greater in the testis. The
expression of p53 is observed in the spermatogonium stage, peaks in
primary spermatocytes, and slightly decreases in the sperm stage,
which is consistent with DNA damage and recombination repair in
the meiotic process (42). The high level of p53 in primary

Frontiers in Endocrinology

10.3389/fendo.2024.1457985

spermatocytes emphasizes its role in DNA repair at low DNA damage-
dependent premeiotic checkpoints (43). Indeed, failure to resolve DSBs
in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes in Tp53 knockout mice prior
to synapsis leads to increased spermatocyte death and testis atrophy
(25). Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) acts as a sensor of
DSBs. As an upstream regulator, activated ATM stabilizes p53 through
direct or indirect phosphorylation by activating checkpoint kinase 2
(CHK2) (44). The response of activated p53 to damaged DNA is
bidirectional. On the one hand, for repairable DNA damage, activated
p53 can initiate cell cycle arrest via the downstream target p21, which
arrests the cell cycle in G1/S or G2/M, to provide time for correcting
DNA damage to promote cell entry into the next normal cell cycle (45).
On the other hand, for DNA damage beyond cell repair, p53
induces apoptosis by activating proapoptotic factors (e.g., Bax and
Caspase3) and inhibiting the antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma-2
(Bcl-2) (44, 46).

Previous studies have shown that the level of p53 is the key
factor that determines whether a cell undergoes growth arrest or
apoptosis; that is,
low p53 levels lead to growth arrest, while
increased p53 levels result in apoptosis (47). Thus, the level of
p53 must be precisely regulated. The Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin
ligase (CRL) is an ubiquitin ligase complex that can recognize
substrates and then ubiquitinate and degrade them (48). CRL4 is a
member of CRL family, which consists of Cullin4, a RING ﬁnger
and DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1)-Cullin4 associated
substrate receptors (49). CRL4 is involved in regulating the level of
p53 to determine whether p53 induces growth arrest during
spermatogenesis (42). It has been reported that Cullin4 promotes
p53 ubiquitin degradation, followed by p21 transcriptional
inactivation (46). Furthermore, p21 is also a substrate of Cullin.
Inactivating the CRL E3 ligase by MLN4924, an inhibitor of Cullin
neddylation, results in p21 accumulation. Interestingly, Cullin4, p53

and p21 exhibit similar expression patterns and intensities during
spermatogenesis, and they are all highly expressed in primary
spermatocytes (42). These ﬁndings indicate the critical role of
Cullin4 in maintaining p53 homeostasis in primary spermatocytes.

2.3 p53 and germ cell death
in spermatogenesis

The apoptosis of germ cells is a normal phenomenon in
spermatogenesis and has been widely observed in SSCs,
spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. Approximately
75% of germ cells will undergo spontaneous apoptosis (35).
Spontaneous apoptosis occurs in all types of human male germ
cells (50). The physiological signiﬁcance of spontaneous apoptosis
is, on the one hand, maintaining the appropriate number of sperm
cells to adapt to the limited support capacity of Sertoli cells and, on
the other hand, eliminating abnormal germ cells (51). Indeed, p53-
mediated germ cell apoptosis is a crucial quality control
mechanism. Multiple studies have shown that p53 overexpression
or underexpression can impair spermatogenesis (Table 1). p53
e l i m i n a t e s D N A - d a m a g e d g e r m c e l l s d u r i n g n o r m a l
spermatogenesis by inducing apoptosis, especially during the
progression of meiosis, as we described in Section 2.2. Tp53
knockout (Tp53-/-) mice exhibit decreased spontaneous apoptosis
and increased germ numbers, along with an increased percentage of
defective sperm and decreased fertility (56). In addition to
spontaneous apoptosis, spermatogenesis also involves
programmed necroptosis (57). A study by Napoletano et al. (52)
have shown that p53 is required to regulate programmed necrosis in
spermatogonia during Drosophila spermatogenesis to control germ
cell number under physiological conditions. Furthermore, blocking

this process can lead to hyperplasia of the Drosophila testes.
However, spontaneous germ cell necrosis takes place very
sporadically in the testes of wild type or Tp53-/- mutant mice at
6-8 weeks of age (52).

In addition, p53-mediated cell death is important for the
response to adverse external stimuli. After irradiation, germ cell
death in wild-type rat testes increased. However, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the germ cell apoptotic response between
irradiated or unirradiated Tp53 knockout rats, which suggested that
radiation-induced germ cell apoptosis is p53 dependent (25).
Similarly, exposure to Ti3C2 nanosheets, a type of 2D
nanomaterial,
led to increased oxidative DNA damage and
subsequent irreversible apoptosis mediated by the ATM/p53
signaling pathway in spermatogonia (58). Additionally, heat
induced programmed necrosis in mouse testes is p53-dependent.
Germ cell programmed necrosis was induced after heat shock at 42°C
for 30 min, while Tp53-/- male mice were resistant to heat-induced
necrosis (52).

Taken together, p53-dependent apoptosis and germ cell
necroptosis are essential for maintaining appropriate sperm
counts and ensuring sperm quality, which ensures successful
spermatogenesis progression.

3 Signaling pathways of p53
in infertility

3.1 p53, oxidative stress and infertility

Oxidative stress, which occurs when the antioxidant defense
system fails to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS),
is
considered a primary cause of male infertility. A meta-analysis of
65 studies (3819 male infertility patients and 2012 controls)
revealed elevated oxidative stress markers and decreased
antioxidant defense in seminal plasma from patients with
infertility (59). ROS are a kind of normal metabolic byproducts.
An appropriate amount of ROS participates in several important
physiological processes, including capacitation, hyperactivation and
the acrosome reaction. Excessive ROS damage male reproduction
via mechanisms related to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, protein
leading to decreased
oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction,
reproductive capacity (60). p53 is involved in oxidative stress
through several mechanisms (Figure 2).

First, p53 can directly affect oxidative stress or be affected by
oxidative stress. On the one hand, p53 directly regulates redox
signals by modulating multiple transcriptional targets associated
with redox homeostasis and exerts bidirectional effects. p53 exerts
prooxidant activity by upregulating its downstream targets, such as
p53-inducible genes (Pigs) and the cytosolic subunit of the NADPH
oxidase enzyme complex (P67phox), or repressing the expression of
peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3) and sulﬁredoxin (Srx). While p53 exerts
antioxidant effects by upregulating several antioxidant genes, such
as glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3), or
repressing the expression of dcyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) and nitric
oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) (61). In addition, under oxidative stimuli,
p53 upregulates the downstream gene TP53-induced glycolysis and

apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) to promote the conversion of the
glycolysis pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby
enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) production to counteract ROS. However,
in an
environment of excessive stimulation, persistent Tigar expression
suppresses phosphofructokinase-1 activity and glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity, resulting in the shutdown of the
glycolysis pathway without activating the pentose phosphate
pathway, ultimately leading to testicular germ cell apoptosis and
infertility (62, 63). The complex role of p53 in oxidative stress is not
contradictory and is associated with the conditions of the cell.
When the cell is in an uncontrollable state, p53 promotes oxidation
to initiate programmed cell death. When the cell is in a normal state
or a mild stress state, p53 induces antioxidant defense to maintain
ROS at a low level to promote cell survival (64).

On the other hand, p53 is sensitive to redox conditions. This
can be ascribed to 10 cysteine residues being easily oxidized by ROS
(61). A reducing environment is required for the binding of p53 to
DNA, in which the thioredoxin (Trx)/thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)
system plays a vital role. The Trx/TrxR system is one of the major
pathways involved in the regulation of redox homeostasis in male
reproduction and can maintain the reduction of its substrates
during sperm maturation (65). Ueno et al. (66) reported that Trx
functions as a collaborator in p53 binding with DNA. A survey of 80
semen samples revealed that lower TrxR activity is accompanied by
a reduction in the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and in the
number of thiol groups, which means that suppressed TrxR activity
leads to a deteriorating oxidative status. In parallel, an obvious
inverse correlation between p53 levels and TrxR activity was
observed (67). In another study, Cordycepin (3’-deoxyadenosine),
a nucleotide analogue from Cordyceps militaris L., reversed the
increase in p53 and Bax in aged rats by restoring antioxidant
defense status through increasing the levels of enzymes (SOD,
CAT, GPx, etc.) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (GSH, vitamin C,
vitamin E, etc.), resulting in the amelioration of aging-mediated
testicular impairment (68). All of these ﬁndings suggest an
association between the activity of p53 and the redox state.

Second, p53 can be activated by DNA damage induced by ROS.
For example, a study by Mu et al. (69) showed that Dendrobium
ofﬁcinale polysaccharides reduced p53-dependent apoptosis in
mouse testicular cells induced by oxidative DNA damage, thereby
ameliorating testicular injury and decreasing sperm quality. The
decrease in the p53 level paralleled the degree of oxidative stress,
and the degree of oxidative stress was dose-dependent (69). DNA
damage mainly promotes p53 nuclear stability through three
pathways to activate downstream targets (e.g., p21, p19, Bax, and
Puma) to determine cell fate. Upon DNA DSBs, p53 is activated by
the ATM/p53 pathway (70). Similarly, upon DNA single-strand
breaks (SSBs), p53 is activated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-
and Rad3-related kinase (ATR)/p53 pathway. In addition, the
DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK) complex can
phosphorylate p53 when the DNA strand breaks (71).

Third, p53 can be activated by oxidative stress-induced sirtuin
(SIRT) suppression. There are seven types of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase enzymes in
including SIRT1- SIRT7 (72). SIRTs can suppress the
SIRTs,

activity of p53 through posttranscriptional deacetylation of the p53
protein. SIRT1 in murine spermatogonia can be suppressed by
oxidative stress of palmitic acid (PA) origin, resulting in elevated
acetylated p53, which partly contributes to apoptotic cell death in
spermatogonia and subfertility. Melatonin protects against PA-
induced damage by restoring acetylated p53 to normal
levels
through the activation of the SIRT1/p53 pathway (73). Mir-34a is
an oxidative stress-responsive RNA that is induced by oxidative
stress (74). Mir-34a can directly bind to Sirt1 mRNA, resulting in a
decrease in the SIRT1 protein. It has been observed that acetylation
of p53 increases via oxidative stress-induced activation of the miR-
34a/SIRT1/p53 pathway, resulting in increased testicular cell
apoptosis in a type 2 diabetic rat model (75). This observation is
in accordance with the ﬁndings of Heydari et al. (76) in the testes of
mice fed a high-fat diet. Similarly, SIRT3 can deacetylate and
inactivate p53 in response to oxidative stress and DNA damage.
Melatonin reversed PM2.5-induced GC-2 cell apoptosis through
activating the SIRT3/p53 deacetylation pathway. The ameliorating
effect of melatonin can be reversed by a speciﬁc inhibitor of SIRT3
(3-TYP) (71). Furthermore, it has been reported that SIRT6 is
oxidized and suppressed under oxidative stress conditions (77). The

BaZiBuShen formula, a Chinese herbal prescription, ameliorated
sperm quality in D-galactose (D-gal)/NaNO2-induced aging mice
by activating the SIRT6/p53 pathway via its antioxidant
properties (78).

In addition, ionizing radiation triggers not only oxidative DNA
damage but also ribosomal stress. Rpl5, a ribosomal protein, acts as
both sensor and effector of ribosomal stress, which can bind to
Mdm2 to inhibit its E3 ligase activity towards p53, thereby
stabilizing p53 (79). Rpl27a, another ribosomal protein, may bind
to both Mdm2 and Rpl5 to regulate p53 through Mdm2-Rpl5
complex. Under ribosomal stress, the expression of Rpl27a is
down-regulated. Decreased Rpl27a weakens its ability to bind to
Rpl5 and Mdm2 but promotes the binding of Rpl5 and Mdm2,
resulting in the increased stability and activation of p53 and
subsequent p53-dependent apoptosis, resulting in testicular
structure abnormality and infertility (80, 81). Furthermore, the
elimination of oxidative stress signiﬁcantly inhibits p53-induced
apoptosis (80).

In conclusion, p53 can directly regulate oxidative stress through
downstream targets, and oxidative stress can subsequently affect
p53 activity. Moreover, p53 can be activated by oxidative stress-

induced DNA damage, SIRT suppression or ribosomal stress. These
mechanisms link oxidative stress, p53 and impaired
fertility together.

3.2 p53, apoptosis and infertility

The apoptosis of germ cells is essential

for normal
spermatogenesis, and p53 plays a key role in this process, as
discussed in Section 2.3. Spontaneous apoptosis is characterized
by relatively frequency in spermatocytes, a low frequency in
spermatogonia, and infrequency in spermatids (67). However,
deregulation of apoptosis in male germ cells is signiﬁcantly
related to male infertility (82). Under some pathological
conditions and external stimuli, such as irradiation and toxicants,
p53-dependent germ cell apoptosis increases dramatically, resulting
in germ cell loss and infertility. For example, compared with those
in normal controls, signiﬁcantly greater expression of Tp53 and
Casp3 and lower expression of the Bcl-2 gene were detected in the
testes of cyclopiazonic acid-exposed mice. Correspondingly,
histomorphological abnormalities and decreased sperm numbers
were observed in the testes of experimental mice (83).

p53 triggers apoptosis in male germ cells through several
pathways (Figure 3). (1) Activated p53 induces apoptosis by
promoting the transcription of downstream proapoptotic genes,
including Puma, Bax and Noxa. (2) p53 triggers transcription-
independent apoptosis by binding directly to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 at
the site of the BH3 binding pocket. The binding sites of p53 in Bcl-2
are the same as those of Bax for binding to Bcl-2, leading to the
release of Bax and activation of apoptosis (84). (3) p53 can induce
apoptosis by promoting the expression of the downstream
transcriptional target Perp (p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-
22). It has been reported that Mkrn2 (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase
makorin-2) gene KO in mice leads to impaired spermatogenesis
mediated by p53/PERP-mediated apoptosis (85). In parallel, a
greater level of PERP expression has been detected in the semen

of patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) than in that
of normal individuals (85). PERP stimulates apoptosis by activating
Caspase-8 to trigger the mitochondrion-Cytochrome c-caspase
protease pathway or facilitating extracellular calcium loading into
the endoplasmic reticulum (86). Interestingly, there is a positive
feedback loop between PERP and p53. PERP promotes p53
phosphorylation and hinders Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination-
mediated degradation of p53, leading to the subsequent stability
and activation of p53 (87). (4) p53 drives miR34c expression to
promote apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of the antiapoptotic
genes Bcl-2 or c-Myc (88). Like other miRNAs, miR34c can inhibit
the transcription or initiate the degradation of target gene mRNAs
by binding to the 3′UTR (89). A study showed signiﬁcantly
increased levels of miR-34c and p53 in semen from patients with
nonobstructive azoospermia and moderate OAT (90). (5) Testicular
cell apoptosis can be mediated by the p53-associated extrinsic factor
associated with suicide (Fas)/Fas ligand (FasL) death signaling
pathway (91). In addition, activated p53 inactivates the serine/
threonine kinase Akt by promoting Akt proteolysis mediated by
caspase, or by transactivating the PTEN gene, which encodes a
phosphatidylinositide phosphatase to prevent Akt activation (92).
Subsequently, inactivated Akt depresses downstream nuclear factor
Bcl-2 expression to initiate apoptosis (93). Besides, proapoptotic
protein Bad, a downstream apoptosis promoter in p53-induced
apoptosis in the testis, is inactivated by Akt, resulting in decreased
apoptosis (94, 95). Thus,
inactivated Akt results in increased
apoptosis in testis.

In short, p53 can induce excessive apoptosis via the intrinsic

and extrinsic apoptotic pathways to impair male fertility (96).

3.3 p53, autophagy and infertility

Autophagy is a conserved lysosome-dependent biological process
responsible for cellular degradation and recycling, including cytosolic
proteins and damaged organelles. Once autophagy is triggered,

phagophores are formed ﬁrst, starting with activation of the UNC-like
autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) initiation complex, followed by
autophagy-related protein (ATG)-driven autophagosome formation, in
which autophagic cargo is segregated. Subsequently, autophagosomes
fuse with lysosomes, where cargo is degraded (97). Under physiological
conditions, autophagy participates in multiple physiological processes
during spermatogenesis, including spermatid polarization, cellular
remodeling and maintenance of the acrosome (98). However,
autophagy has two effects on cells. Brieﬂy, moderate induction of
autophagy plays a cytoprotective role, which promotes cell survival by
removing damaged cell components. However, excessive autophagy
causes autophagic death (99). This feature of autophagy is no exception
for male germ cells. For example, suppressed autophagy has been
observed in ﬂutamide-induced neonatal cryptorchid infertile rats, and
retinoic acid improved spermatogenesis by activating autophagy via
inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (100). In contrast, in
another study, excessive autophagy and increased apoptosis have been
detected in a murine model of oligoasthenospermia induced by
treatment with cyclophosphamide. Schisandrin A, a helpful bioactive
lignan, improved sperm quality by mitigating excessive autophagy-
induced apoptosis by promoting Akt phosphorylation in this study
(101). Akt is one of regulatory proteins connecting apoptosis and
autophagy (102). Phosphorylated Akt, on one hand, inhibits autophagy
by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway, on the other hand, inhibits
apoptosis by phosphorylating Mdm2 at Ser 166 to facilitate the
degradation of p53 (103). These studies conﬁrmed that dysregulation
of autophagy is related to infertility, as well as the interplay between
apoptosis and autophagy.

p53, similar to Akt, is involved not only in apoptosis, as
mentioned above, but also in the regulation of autophagy
(Figure 3). p53 plays dual roles in autophagy in male germ cells.
On the one hand, activated p53 can enhance autophagy by directly
inducing the expression of autophagy genes. p53-dependent
induction of autophagy genes has been observed in mouse and
human cells under DNA damage conditions (104). Many
autophagy genes have been identiﬁed as p53 target genes (e.g.,
Atg2b, Atg4a, Atg7, Atg10, and Ulk2) (104). It has been conﬁrmed
that p53 promotes autophagy under various stimuli, such as DNA
damage and genetic activation (104). Microcystin-leucine-arginine
(MC-LR), an intracellular toxin, can trigger oxidative stress-
mediated DNA damage, leading to the presence of DSBs, which
can be recognized by ATM. Subsequently, ATM phosphorylates the
downstream protein p53 and activates p53-induced autophagy by
increasing the levels of autophagy proteins, such as Beclin1, ATG5
and LC3-I, resulting in pathological damage in murine testes. In
parallel, treatment with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 suppressed
autophagy and alleviated this damage by inhibiting the ATM/p53
pathway (105). On the other hand, p53 suppresses autophagy in
some cases. In vitro experiments showed that busulfan inhibited
autophagy by phosphorylating Akt at Ser473 and subsequently
activating the Akt/mTOR pathway, resulting in massive SPCs
death. Interestingly, an increase in the level of phosphorylated
p53 was accompanied by mTOR-mediated autophagy suppression
after busulfan treatment for 2 h to 8 h. Moreover, p53-deﬁcient
SPCs exhibited attenuated autophagy inhibition and decreased p-

mTOR after busulfan treatment for 6 h. In general, p53 participates
in busulfan-induced autophagy inhibition by partly activating
mTOR in SPCs (106). The mechanisms by which p53 activates
mTOR have been clearly clariﬁed in a recent review by Cui et al.
(107). The bilateral effects of p53 on autophagy are considered to be
related to its intracellular localization. The nuclear localization of
p53 induces autophagy, while the accumulation of p53 in the
cytoplasm inhibits autophagy (108). Notably, a previous study
demonstrated that p53 induced SPC apoptosis under busulfan
stress (70). This suggested that p53 participated in the ﬁne
regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in male germ cells. It is
still unclear how p53 initiates apoptosis or autophagy under the
same stress conditions. The selection tendency of p53 may be
related to the intensity and duration of stress, which enable p53
to execute cellular responses suitable for speciﬁc cellular states.

4 p53 and male infertility-
related diseases

The indispensable role of p53 in spermatogenesis suggests that
p53 is closely associated with male infertility and various infertility
diseases. The activation of p53 was observed in testicular samples
from infertile patients (109). Here, we showed several male
infertility-related diseases associated with p53.

4.1 OAT

OAT includes oligospermia and asthenozoospermia, which refers
to a sperm cell count lower than 15 million/ml in male ejaculate and/or
total motility <40% and progressive motility <32% in a semen sample,
and abnormal sperm morphology (110, 111). Several studies have
indicated that p53 is elevated in oligoasthenozoospermia. Compared to
that in the normozoospermic group, the level of p53 in semen samples
from asthenozoospermic donors is greater, as is the level of ROS,
leading to increased levels of apoptotic sperm in the ejaculatory semen
(67). Another study involving 29 men (11 with asthenozoospermia and
18 controls) showed that the expression of p53 is greater in
asthenozoospermic men and that there is a signiﬁcant negative
correlation between p53 levels and sperm motility, as well as between
p53 levels and sperm concentration (112). Similarly, a study by Rahbar
et al. (113) showed that sperm and testicular tissue samples from
individuals with severe OAT and moderate OAT had signiﬁcantly
greater expression of the TP53 and CASP9 genes than those from
individuals in the normal sperm group. In parallel, a signiﬁcant
association between p53 and miR‐15b, a microRNA that can
stimulate p53 phosphorylation, was also observed in this study (113).
Brieﬂy, aberrant activation of p53 might contribute to OAT.

4.2 Varicocele

Varicocele, deﬁned as an abnormal expansion of
the
pampiniform plexus of gonadal veins above the testicle, is one of
the most common causes of male infertility (114). Increased

Frontiers in Endocrinology

10.3389/fendo.2024.1457985

expression of p53 and BAK was observed in ejaculated semen
samples from varicocele patients, suggesting the occurrence of
remarkably active p53-dependent apoptosis (115). Spermatocytes
of the testis are considered the cells mainly affected by varicocele-
associated apoptosis (115). The increase in p53, Cytochrome c, and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 levels has also been
observed in varicocele-induced rats, which indicated that
oxidative stress-induced p53 activation plays a role in varicocele
(116). Moreover, another study showed elevated levels of
phosphorylated p53 and a marker of DBSs, phosphorylated
histone g-H2AX accumulation in a time course-dependent
manner in varicocele murine models, suggesting that activation of
p53-dependent apoptosis is mediated by g-H2AX (117).
Furthermore, an inverse association has been observed between
the proportion of the TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg genotype, and sperm
motility in men with varicocele (118). Codon 72 has a
polymorphism that encodes the amino acids arginine (Arg 72) or
proline (Pro 72), which inﬂuences the structure and function of p53.
The Arg 72 variant of p53 more potently induces apoptosis by
enhancing its interaction with the mitochondria and promoting the
release of cytochrome c release (119). The increased testicular
temperature has been observed in experimental varicocele models
and in man, and is widely considered to be a mechanism by which
varicocele affects testicular function. And p53 acts as a master
regulator in germ cell apoptosis induced by hyperthermia
(120, 121). Those ﬁndings suggest that p53 is associated with
infertility caused by varicocele.

4.3 Cryptorchidism

Cryptorchidism, a condition in which one or both testes fail to
descend into the scrotum, is associated with an increased risk of
infertility (122). A rise in testicular temperature was considered a
main factor for the impairement of testicular functions in
experimental induced cryptorchidism in rodents or men with
cryptorchidism (123, 124). A study revealed that the initial phase
of germ cell apoptosis induced by heat stress caused by
experimental cryptorchidism was mediated by p53-dependent
pathway (125). Another study by Zhou et al. (126) showed
increased levels of p53 and Fas protein, as well as testicular cell
apoptosis, and decreased testicular weight in a surgery-induced
cryptorchidism murine model. Moreover, a reduction in the levels
of p53 and Fas mediated by the overexpression of Cirp (cold-
inducible RNA-binding protein) ameliorated the increase in germ
cell apoptosis and testicular injury induced by cryptorchidism.
Additionally, testicular orphan receptor-2 (TR2), a member of the
steroid-sensitive hormone receptor superfamily is involved in p53-
mediated cryptorchidism-related infertility. TR2 is highly expressed
in testes, and can regulate retinoic acid receptors/retinoid X
receptors (RARs/RXRs) signal pathways (127, 128). A study
showed that the expression level of TR2 mRNA decreased with
the progression of p53-mediated germ cell apoptosis in the
cryptorchid testis of rat and rhesus monkey (128). Future
research showed that TR2 was repressed by activating the p53/

retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) signaling pathway through the
direct combination of Rb and TR2 in surgery-induced cryptorchid
testes of rhesus monkeys (129). These results suggest that p53 is
involved in cryptorchidism-induced infertility.

4.4 Idiopathic male infertility

Idiopathic male infertility refers to infertility in men with
abnormal sperm parameters after excluding possible factors and
is responsible for approximately 40% of cases (130). Several studies
have shown that p53 polymorphisms are associated with idiopathic
male infertility. For instance, a study conducted by Mashayekhi
et al. (131) revealed a more frequent Arg allele of the TP53 codon 72
polymorphism in men with idiopathic infertility than in controls. In
addition, a case-control study including 580 infertile patients and
580 controls showed a signiﬁcantly increased risk of genetic variants
in TP53 (rs2287498) and MDM2 (rs937283) associated with
idiopathic male infertility in a Chinese population (132).
However, inconsistent conclusions exist. A case–;control study
including 198 idiopathic infertile patients and 233 fertile controls
revealed no association between the codon 72 and IVS7 + 72C>T
polymorphisms of the TP53 gene and spermatogenetic failure (133).
Similarly, another investigation conducted by de Morais et al. (134)
revealed no association between the TP53 polymorphism in codon
72 and male idiopathic infertility. It seems that whether the TP53
polymorphism is involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic male
infertility is associated with different demographic factors.

4.5 Testicular torsion

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency accompanied by
scrotal pain and ischemia and subsequent testicular ischemia–;
reperfusion injury (tIRI), resulting in cell damage and even
infertility (135, 136). A study by Shamsi-Gamchi et al. (137)
showed that testicular torsion caused severe DNA damage
induced by oxidative stress,
leading to markedly increased
expression of Tp53, p21, cyclin D1, Bax and Casp3 in a time-
dependent manner, as well as a signiﬁcant increase in the apoptosis
index, resulting in deteriorated testicular tissue and decreased
sperm count in murine testicular tissue within 8 hours after
testicular torsion. Mechanically, p53 induced by DNA damage
activates p21. Subsequently, p21 binds with Cdk4 to suppress the
Cyclin D1/Cdk4-related cell cycling process and ﬁnally induce p53/
p21-dependent apoptosis (137). Similarly, another study showed
that tIRI triggered oxidative stress, thereby upregulating the
phosphorylation of p53 and the expression of its downstream
proapoptotic factor Puma, resulting in increased apoptosis. In
addition, during tIRI, p53 induces sustained expression of the
gene Tigar,
leading to the failure to convert glycolysis to the
pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in testicular germ cell
apoptosis (62, 63). In summary, p53-dependent apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest are related to testicular injury caused by
testicular torsion.

5 Potential therapeutic agents
affecting the p53-related pathways in
male infertility

Recently, efforts have been made to develop p53-targeted therapies
for certain diseases, such as cancer and neuroinﬂammation (138, 139).
As a result, many potential therapeutic agents, including natural and
synthetic drugs and small molecule compounds, have been developed.
The effects of several agents affecting the p53-related pathways on male
infertility are shown in Table 2. Among them, piﬁthrin-a, a p53 speciﬁc
inhibitor, directly targets p53 by obstructing the p53 protein in the
nucleus (144). Excitingly, innovative therapeutic strategies targeting
p53,
including Mdm2 inhibitors and mutant p53-restoring
compounds, have shown great potential in cancer treatment in
clinical trials (145). It can be expected that innovative approaches
targeting p53 can be implemented for the treatment of male infertility
in the near future.

6 Conclusion remarks

p53 plays a central role in the response to cellular stress and is
involved in multiple biological processes. Herein, we present an
overview of the essential roles of p53 in normal spermatogenesis
and the possible mechanisms by which p53 is involved in male
infertility. We conclude that mutated p53 is a risk factor for male
infertility and aberrant p53 expression might be related to male
infertility. Recently, considerable efforts have been made to develop
small molecules targeting p53, which is highly promising for cancer
therapies (146). Although testicular microenvironment and
pathology differ from the tumoral, considering the high potential
of p53 to be targeted for drug therapy, insights into the interplay
between p53 and spermatogenesis and male infertility are needed,
which opens up avenues for novel p53-based therapeutic
interventions. In the context of male infertility, combined
therapies that both alleviate testicular stress and target p53 and/or
its activated pathways should be more effective than focusing on one

alone. However, several questions remain to be answered. How does
p53 balance apoptosis and autophagy? Clariﬁcation of the speciﬁc
mechanism that determines this effect is urgently needed.
Spermatogenesis is a unique and complex cell cycle process
required for ﬁne regulation. The level of p53 must also be
precisely regulated. Therefore, when targeting p53, which
indicator can be used to detect whether the activation or
inhibition of p53 is appropriate? Addressing these concerns will
aid in the clinical treatment of infertility with strategies based on the
attractive target p53.
