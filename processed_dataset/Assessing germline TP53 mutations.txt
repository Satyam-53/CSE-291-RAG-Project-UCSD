Abstract 
Background  Germline TP53 gene variants are intricately linked to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare and aggressive 
hereditary cancer syndrome. This study investigated the frequency and spectrum of TP53 pathogenic variants associ-
ated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a large cohort of mainly breast cancer patients from Russia.

Methods  The study analyzed 3,455 genomic DNA samples from cancer patients using next-generation sequencing 
panels and whole-genome sequencing. Clinically significant TP53 variants were identified and validated using Sanger 
sequencing. The clinical and family history characteristics of patients with TP53 variants were analyzed.

Results  The analysis identified 13 (0.4%) individuals with clinically significant germline TP53 variants, all of whom 
were females with either unilateral breast cancer or breast cancer as part of multiple primary malignant neoplasms. 
The average age of breast cancer manifestation was 39.9 years, with a median of 36 years. Only 38.5% of the TP53 
mutation carriers met the modified Chompret criteria for TP53 testing.

Conclusions  The findings underscore the necessity of thorough phenotype and family history analysis in genetic 
counseling to effectively diagnose LFS, and emphasize the importance of identifying TP53 variant carriers for devel-
oping treatment strategies, prognosis, and monitoring, as well as for identifying high-risk family members. The study 
also highlights that the current guidelines fail to identify over half of the TP53 mutation carriers, suggesting the need 
for a more comprehensive approach to genetic testing in suspected hereditary cancer cases.

Background
Hereditary  malignant  neoplasms  (MN)  are  observed 
across  virtually  all  primary  tu-mor  sites,  constituting 
an  average  of  10%  of  all  initially  detected  tumors.  The 
heightened  predisposition  to  oncological  diseases  stems 
from  the  presence  of  germline  mutations  in  oncogenes 
and  tumor  suppressor  genes.  These  mutations  signifi-
cantly  contribute  to  the  development  of  hereditary  can-
cer syndromes (HCS). HCS often manifest with a specific 
spectrum  of  MN,  wherein  the  risk  of  developing  can-
cer  in  specific  locations  varies  from  moderate  to  high, 
depending upon the affected gene and the type of struc-
tural aberration, thereby determining the degree of can-
cer awareness in each particular case.

One of the most significant HCS is the TP53-associated 
cancer syndrome, also known as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome 
(LFS). LFS was initially described by Joseph Fraumeni and 
Frederick  Li  in  1969,  following  a  retrospective  analysis 
of a cohort of children with rhabdomyosarcoma. Subse-
quently, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern was 
identified  for  LFS.  The  exact  prevalence  of  the  disease 
remains  undetermined  to  date.  LFS  is  characterized  by 
early onset and a wide spectrum of tumors with the most 
common  including  soft  tissue  sarcomas  (26.4%),  central 
nervous system (CNS) tumors (13.1%), soft tissue sarco-
mas (11.6%), osteosarcomas (9.1%), adrenocortical carci-
noma (5.2%), hematologic malignancies (4.7%), colorectal 
cancer  (3.6%),  lung  cancer  (3.6%),  gastric  cancer  (3.1%), 
alongside  MN  at  other  sites  (19.4%)  [1]. The  cumulative 
risk of developing at least one neoplasm reaches 40–50% 
by  the  age  of  30  and  80–100%  –  by  the  age  of  70  [1, 2]. 
Germline mutations in the TP53 gene serve as the initiat-
ing event in the development of LFS, defining the initial 
stages of carcinogenesis. In 70–80% of cases with clinical 
manifestations  of  LFS,  germline  mutations  in  the  TP53 
gene  are  detected  [3],  while  estimates  suggest  that  the 

contribution of de novo mutation variants ranges from 7 
to  20%  out  of  identified  cases  [4].  Somatic  mutations  in 
TP53 are also considered the most prevalent alteration in 
the formation of many types of MN and can be detected 
in 50% of tumors [5].

The p53 protein is encoded by the TP53 gene, located 
on chromosome 17p13.1. It comprises 11 exons, with the 
first being non-coding. There are at least 12 isoforms of 
the p53 protein: p53 (or p53α), p53 (β, γ), Δ40p53 (α, β, 
γ), Δ133p53 (α, β, γ), and Δ160p53 (α, β, γ) (Fig. 1). Vari-
ous  protein  isoforms  arise  from  molecular  mechanism 
variations: alternative splicing (intron 2, α/β/γ segments), 
alternative promoters (P1 and P2), alternative translation 
initiation (start codons 1, 40, 133, 160) [6]. These p53 iso-
forms  exhibit  distinct  functional  features,  and  their  cel-
lular proportions vary depending on the type of healthy 
or  tumorous  tissue.  The  canonical  form  of  p53  is  most 
common in the cell. Among all isoforms, it possesses the 
largest molecular mass (53 kDa), consisting of 393 amino 
acids, and is divided into 7 domains (Fig. 1).

The p53 protein is activated in response to DNA dam-
age,  hypoxia,  metabolic  dysfunction,  heat  shock,  and 
oncogene  expression  (Fig.  2).  It  ensures  genome  stabil-
ity  by  performing  various  functions,  including  cell  cycle 
control,  initiation  of  DNA  damage  re-pair,  and,  in  cases 
where  restoration  of  the  defect  is  impossible,  triggering 
apoptosis.  In  the  absence  of  stress  stimuli,  the  concen-
tration of p53 in the cell remains low and is maintained 
through a balance between its synthesis and degradation. 
Excess amount of p53 can lead to programmed cell death, 
while  a  deficiency  of  one  increases  the  malignant  trans-
formation risk. By impeding the proliferation of cells with 
damaged  DNA,  p53  serves  as  a  crucial  oncosuppressor 
[7].

Mutations in the TP53 gene can affect the function of 

the p53 protein in different ways:

Fig. 1  Structure of the TP53 gene and different isoforms of the p53 protein. The N-terminal domains TAD1 and TAD2 (transactivation domain) are 
required for the activation of functionally related p53 target genes. The PXXP domain (proline-rich domain) plays an important role in the apoptotic 
activity of p53. The DNABD domain (DNA-binding domain, DNA-binding domain, “zinc finger”) directly interacts with DNA. NLS (nuclear localization 
domain) is a nuclear localization domain, OD (oligomerization domain) is an oligomerization (tetramerization) domain, NEG (negative-regulation 
domain) is a negative regulation domain that ensures the detachment of DNABD from DNA

Fig. 2  The main signaling pathways of the p53 protein in the cell. DNA damage caused by various stress factors (UV radiation, radiation, viral 
infection) activates protein kinases ATR, ATM, DNA-PK, which belong to the PIKK family. One of the signaling pathways of these protein kinases 
includes the p53 protein, the degradation of which as a result slows down and its concentration increases. The p53 protein acts as a transcription 
factor, activating some genes (GADD45, MDM2, BAX, BAK, p21) and suppressing others (BCL-2, BCL-XL). In some signaling pathways, p53 interacts 
with other proteins, for example with mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins during the initiation of apoptosis [6]. One of the protein regulators 
of p53 is MDM2, which interacts with p53 according to the principle of negative feedback. The p53 protein enhances MDM2 transcription, 
while MDM2 acts as a ubiquitin ligase to promote p53 degradation. The p21 protein inhibits the complex of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases, 
in the event of DNA damage, preventing the transition from G1 to S phase and thus stopping the cell cycle. In the absence of the p21 protein, 
the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK phosphorylates the Rb protein, and the transcription factor E2F is involved in DNA synthesis. If DNA damage 
cannot be repaired, p53 initiates apoptosis, including regulating the expression of bcl-2 family genes

1  Loss-of-function  (LOF):  Complete  or  partial  loss  of 

the wild-type protein function.

2  Dominant-negative  (DN):  Dominant-negative  effect, 
where  the  mutant  protein  forms  tetramers  with  the 
wild-type protein and suppresses p53 function in the 
cell.

3  Gain-of-function  (GOF):  Acquisition  of  atypical 
functions,  such  as  the  ability  to  activate  promoters 
atypical for the p53 protein.

Various  mechanisms  can  implement  each  of  these 

effects, and they may coexist.

Testing  for  TP53  gene  mutation  carriage  should  be 
conducted  before  initiating  treatment,  as  the  test  result 
can influence the therapeutic strategy. Recommendations 

for TP53 gene mutation testing are presented in Table 1 
[8]. Having an increased risk of developing MN at other 
sites, patients carrying TP53 mutations should be recom-
mended  to  avoid  radiotherapy  and  DNA-toxic  chemo-
therapy.  In  these  cases,  surgical  methods  should  be 
preferred when choosing a treatment strategy [9].

Only  isolated  cases  of  Russian  families  with  LFS  diag-
nosis, are published elsewhere. The exact incidence of Li-
Fraumeni  syndrome  among  Russian  cancer  patients  has 
not yet been defined. The aim of this study was to inves-
tigate  the  frequency  and  spectrum  of  TP53  pathogenic 
variants associated with LFS in a large cohort of mainly 
of  breast  cancer  patients  from  Russia.  Also,  the  geno-
type–phenotype  correlations  from  13  unrelated  patients 
diagnosed with TP53-associated MN are presented.

Methods
This  study  analyzed  the  mutational  distribution  of 
clinically  significant  TP53  germline  variants  in  3455 
patients  with  diagnosed  cancer  and  suspected  heredi-
tary  cancer  syndrome.  These  patients  were  identified 
across  various  medical  institutions  using  molecular 
genetic  methods  based  on  Next-Generation  Sequenc-
ing (NGS): multi-gene NGS panel testing (1655 studies) 
and whole-genome sequencing (WGS, 1800 studies).

Out  of  the  total  cohort,  3247  were  females  (94%) 
and  208  were  males  (4%).  Among  the  examined  indi-
viduals,  2957  were  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer 
(85.6%),  including  cases  occurring  before  the  age  of 
31  (100/2957,  3.4%),  bilateral  breast  cancer  (138/2957, 
4.7%),  and  breast  cancer  as  part  of  MPMN  involving 
other  locations  (205/2957,  6.9%).  Addition-ally,  498 
individuals  (14.4%)  presented  with  tumors  in  the  ova-
ries,  colon,  pancreas,  and  other  locations.  The  average 
age  of  solid  tumor  manifestation  in  the  studied  group 
of  3455  patients  was  46.47  y.o.  (95%  CI:  46.12–46.83; 
range 11–86 y.o.y.o.).

NGS  Panels.  The  study  involved  analyzing  1655 
peripheral  blood  samples  from  patients  receiving  spe-
cialized  care  at  the  Moscow  Clinical  Research  Center 
named  after  A.S.  Loginov. This  analysis  utilized  multi-
gene  custom  NGS  panels  in  the  laboratories  of  the 
Centre for Strategic Planning and Management of Bio-
medical  Health  Risks  (Moscow,  Russia),  Engelhardt 
Institute  of  Molecular  Biology  of  Russian  Academy  of 
Sciences  (Moscow,  Russia)  and  Kazan  Federal  (Kazan, 
Russia)  using  the  Illumina  MiSeq  sequencer  (Tables  2 

and  3).  Sample  preparation,  sequencing,  and  bioinfor-
matic  processing  followed  the  methodology  previously 
described in article [11].

WGS was conducted on 1800 patients receiving treat-
ment in six state-funded healthcare institutions in Mos-
cow:  Moscow  City  Clinical  Hospital  No.1,  Moscow 
Clinical  Scientific  Center  Named  after  Loginov,  Mos-
cow  City  Clinical  Hospital  No.62,  Moscow  City  Clinical 
Hospital  named  after  S.P.  Botkin,  Moscow  City  Clinical 
Hospital  named  after  D.D.  Pletnev,  and  Moscow  Medi-
cal Cluster "Kommunarka". The patient selection criteria, 
materials, and methods are detailed in article [12].

The  methodology  of  molecular  genetic  diagnostics, 
quality  control,  and  genome-wide  sequencing,  as  well 
as the examination of gene panels, was described in our 
previous article [13, 14].

The  clinical  significance  of  nucleotide  sequence  vari-
ants was analyzed according to the recommendations of 
the American College of Medical Genetics and Genom-
ics  (ACMG).  This  analysis  employed  specialized  bioin-
formatic  algorithms  and  databases,  including  OMIM 
(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), NCBI (National 
Center  for  Bio-technology  Information),  VarSome  (The 
Human  Genomics  Community),  and  others,  as  well  as 
scientific literature data. Population frequencies of iden-
tified variants were assessed using the gnomAD (Genome 
Aggregation Database).

This study presents the carrier status results of clini-
cally  significant  variants  in  the  coding  region  of  the 
TP53,  20  base  pairs  proximal  to  the  5’  end  and  20 
base  pairs  distal  to  the  3’  end  of  each  exon  have  been

analyzed. Point mutation, microinsertion, deletion and 
duplication  (< 20  bp)  at  exon  level  can  be  simultane-
ously  detected.  Certain  copy  number  variants  (CNV) 
such  as  large  fragment  of  heterozygous  gene,  special 
mutations  such  as  dynamic  mutation,  complex  recom-
bination,  structural  variants  (e.g.:  large  fragment  dele-
tion,  duplication  and  inversion  rearrangement),  large 
fragment  heterozygous  insertion  (e.g.:  Alu-induced 
insertion)  as  well  as  mutations  in  gene  regulatory 
region  and  deep  intronic  region  was  excluded  from 
calculations  to  facilitate  a  valid  comparison  of  results 
between NGS panels and WGS.

Clinically  significant  variants  were  validated  using  the 
Sanger sequencing. Data processing was performed using 
GraphPad  Prism  v.9.5.1  (https:// www. graph pad. com/) 
through  descriptive  statistical  methods:  proportions  are 
presented  in  percentages,  means  with  95%  confidence 

intervals,  and  statistical  tests  considered  a  significance 
level of p < 0.05.

Results
In a comprehensive analysis of 3455 genomic DNA sam-
ples  from  breast  cancer  patients,  13  individuals  (0.4%) 
unrelated  to  each  other  were  identified  with  clinically 
significant  germline  variants  in  the  TP53  gene.  Nota-
bly,  all  mutation  carriers  were  females,  with  either  uni-
lateral  breast  cancer  (9/13;  69.2%)  or  breast  cancer  as 
part of MPMN (4/13; 30.8%): bilateral breast cancer in 3 
cases and Hodgkin lymphoma in 1 case. The average age 
of  manifestation  of  breast  cancer  was  39.9  y.o.  (95%  CI: 
33.1–46.8, range 28–66 y.o.), with a median age of mani-
festation – 36.0 y.o.

Among  the  TP53  mutation  carriers,  84.6%  (11/13) 
had  pathogenic  variants  (P),  15.4%  (2/13)  had  likely

pathogenic variants (LP). In 11 cases missense variants 
in 1 case 9 bp exon 7 in frame deletion (c.754_762del) 
and in 1 case splice acceptor variant in intron 4 (c.376-
1G > C)  were  identified.  All  detected  variants  affected 
regions of the TP53 gene associated with the synthesis 
of the DNA-binding domain (DNABD) of the p53 pro-
tein (Fig. 3).

Among  the  surveyed  patients,  38.5%  (5/13)  met  the 
modified  Chompret  criteria.  The  remaining  61.5% 
(n = 8)  of  individuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer 
were  older  than  31  y.o.  at  diagnosis,  and  their  family 
history  did  not  align  with  recommendations  for TP53 
mutation  testing.  Clinical  and  family  history  charac-
teristics  of  patients  with  identified  variants  are  pre-
sented in Table 4.

A  notable  69.2%  (9/13)  of  patients  reported  a  fam-
ily cancer history. Among them, 38.4% (5/13) had first 
or second-degree relatives with confirmed breast can-
cer. In 30.8% (4/13) of cases, there was a clustering of 
oncological diseases across multiple generations, illus-
trated in the pedigrees of these patients in Fig. 4.

Histological types in breast cancer included unspeci-
fied  invasive  carcinoma  (13/15,  86.6%),  ductal  car-
cinoma  in  situ  with  foci  of  invasion  (1/15,  6.6%),  and 
ductal carcinoma in situ (1/15, 6.6%). The clinical and 
morphological features of breast cancer in TP53 muta-
tion carriers are outlined in Table 5.

Discussion
The  frequency  of  identified  TP53  clinically  significant 
germline  variants  was  0.4%  (13/3455)  and  in  all  cases 
TP53  mutations  were  identified  in  females  with  breast 
cancer.  Therefore,  the  proportion  of  TP53-associated 
breast cancer within all breast cancer cases in our cohort 
was  0.44%  (13/2957),  consistent  with  existing  literature 
[19].  The  predominance  of  this  localization  of  cancer 
types is attributed to the high prevalence of breast cancer 
patients in our cohort and the elevated risk of breast can-
cer in the spectrum of tumors typical for LFS.

Among patients with breast cancer aged up to 31 y.o., 
the  proportion  of  carriers  of  pathogenic  TP53  variants 
was 3.0% (3/100), aligning with previously reported rates 
of 3.8%-6.0% for patients ≤ 31 y.o. [19, 20].

According  to  the  TP53  Database  (version  R20,  ISB-
CGC,  https:// Tp53. isb- cgc. org/),  the  most 
frequent 
germline  variants  in  the  TP53  gene  are  located  at  posi-
tions  Arg175,  Arg213,  Gly245,  Arg248,  Arg273,  Arg282, 
and  Arg337,  accounting  for  40%  (937/2358)  of  missense 
mutations in the database. Excluding the position Arg337, 
characteristic of the southern Brazilian population, these 
positions account for 32% of mutations. In our study, var-
iants categorized as frequent according to the TP53 Data-
base accounted for 30.8% of the identified TP53 variants: 
c.524G > A  (Arg175;  n = 1;  7.7%),  c.743G > A  (Arg248;

Fig. 4  Pedigrees of patients with cancer among relatives in several generations (P02, P03, P05, P06). The onset age for alive relatives and the death 
age if a relative died. Our study also revealed two pairs of unrelated patients with recurring TP53 variants (c.542G > A and c.743G > A)

scientific  literature,  were  represented  by  missense  vari-
ants within the DNABD domain.

One TP53 variant identified in our study absent in the 
GnomAD  population  frequency  database  and  are  not 
described in literature or databases. In patient P02, har-
boring  the  variant  c.376-1G > C  in  intron  4,  the  family 
history and clinical features align with Chompret criteria 
(Fig. 4). Scientific literature describes a different nucleo-
tide  substitution  in  the  same  DNA  position—c.376-
1G > A,  clinically  significant,  disrupting  the  canonical 
splice  acceptor  site  and  detected  in  patients  exhibiting 
features  of  LFS  [21–24].  Such  genetic  alterations  pre-
dominantly result in protein loss of function (LOF) [25]. 
Based on this data, the previously undescribed variant is 
annotated as pathogenic.

In  the  present  study,  it  was  observed  that  a  signifi-
cant  proportion  of  TP53  pathogenic  variants  appear 
to  occur  outside  of  LFS  families,  which  is  a  notewor-
thy  finding.  However,  a  recent  report  from  a  larger 

study  indicates  a  higher  proportion  of  carriers  com-
plying  with  the  modified  Chompret  criteria  [26].  This 
discrepancy  may  be  attributed  to  the  lower  sensitivity 
of  the  Chompret  criteria  in  our  study,  which  could  be 
due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  in  the  group  of 
TP53 mutation carriers. A larger cohort may provide a 
more comprehensive understanding of the relationship 
between TP53 variants and compliance with the Chom-
pret  criteria,  highlighting  the  need  for  further  investi-
gation in this area.

Our study revealed two pairs of unrelated patients har-
boring described pathogenic variants. The first pair (P05 
and P06) exhibited variant c.542G > A in exon 5, leading 
to  the  p.Arg181His  substitution.  The  minor  allele  fre-
quency is 0.00001314 (GnomAD Genomes). Patient P05, 
aged  38,  was  diagnosed  with  unilateral  breast  cancer, 
whereas  patient  P06,  aged  47,  was  diagnosed  with  syn-
chronous  bilateral  breast  cancer.  Both  reported  familial 
history of breast cancer and lung cancer (Fig. 4).

Page 11 of 13

The  second  pair  (P08  and  P09)  exhibited  variant 
c.743G > A  in  exon  7,  resulting  in  the  p.Arg248Gln  sub-
stitution. The substitution at position Arg248 is the most 
prevalent  according  to  TP53  Database,  accounting  for 
9.1%  of  all  described  germline  pathogenic  TP53  vari-
ants.  Patient  P09,  aged  49,  had  unilateral  breast  cancer, 
while patient P08 had Hodgkin’s lymphoma at age 20 and 
breast cancer at age 29. Both reported a familial history 
of breast cancer (Table 4).

Our  study  involved  138  patients  with  synchronous/
metachronous  bilateral  breast  cancer,  accounting  for 
4.7%  (138/2957)  of  all  breast  cancer  patients.  Among 
TP53  mutation  carriers,  23.1%  (3/13)  exhibited  bilat-
eral  breast  cancer  (OR = 5.9289,  95%  CI:  1.6130–
21.7933,  p-value = 0.0074).  Kwong  A.  et  al.  [27]  results 
indicated  an  OR = 7.0011  (95%  CI:  2.8449–17.2292, 
p-value < 0.0001),  aligning  with  our  findings.  Thus,  syn-
chronous/metachronous  bilateral  breast  cancer  is  sig-
nificantly  more  prevalent  among  breast  cancer  patients 
with  TP53  gene  mutations  compared  to  those  without 
mutations.

Functional characteristics of TP53 mutations

In the study by Giacomelli AO et al. [17] an experimen-
tal  assessment  of  various  TP53  gene  mutations  impact 
on p53 protein function was demonstrated. Several thou-
sands  malignant  tumor  cell  lines  with  different  TP53 

mutations  were  analyzed,  subjected  to  substances  acti-
vating  p53:  nutlin-3  (inhibitor  of  MDM2  and  p53  bind-
ing)  or  etoposide  (topoisomerase  II  inhibitor,  causing 
DNA damage). The presence of Dominant Negative (DN) 
and  Loss  of  Function  (LOF)  effects  for  each  mutation 
was  determined  through  experiments.  Analyzing  TP53 
Database  data  reveals  that  these  characteristics  statisti-
cally significantly influence the age of disease manifesta-
tion (Fig. 5). For breast cancer patients the average age of 
manifestation is 38.9 y.o. with LOF + (95% CI: 36.4–41.3) 
and  53.6  y.o.  (95%  CI:  47.0–60.1)  with  LOF—  muta-
tions.  This  pattern  holds  true  for  malignant  tumors  at 
other locations. For lung cancer, the average age of man-
ifestation  is  50.7  (95%  CI:  44.3–57.1)  and  60.4  (95%  CI: 
52.2–70.7)  y.o.,  and  for  brain  cancer,  it  is  22.5  (95%  CI: 
18.5–26.6)  and  34.9  (95%  CI:  25.0–44.8)  y.o.  (LOF + and 
LOF- respectively).

In  the  study  by  Kato  S  et  al.  [18]  the  assessment  of 
p53  protein  function  with  different  mutations  was  con-
ducted using a different method. For each TP53 mutation 
in  yeast  culture  the  median  transcriptional  activity  of 
p53  was  calculated  across  8  specific  promoters  (activity 
expressed  as  a  percentage  of  wild-type  protein  activity). 
Missense  variants  were  classified  as  "non-functional"  if 
the median was ≤ 20%; "partially functional" if the median 
was > 20% and ≤ 75%; "functional" if the median was > 75% 
and ≤ 140%;  and  finally,  "super-functional"  if  the  median 

Fig. 5  Age of manifestation of cancer depending on the location and functional type of mutation. LOF ± – presence or absence of the loss 
of function effect according to Giacomelli et al. [17], NF is a non-functional variant, PF is a partially functional variant according to data from [18]. 
The majority of mutations in the TP53 gene identified in our study are classified as LOF + /NF. LOF—/PF mutations were detected in 5 patients (P05, 
P06, P07, P11, P12). Given the wide age range at manifestation for each functional mutation type, this parameter does not allow to perform precise 
prognosis for a specific carrier. However, it may be valuable for assessing the clinical significance of the variant and evaluating the risk of early 
manifestation of cancer in a family

was > 140. According to scientific literature in TP53 Data-
base  most  breast  cancer  patients  with  breast  cancer  are 
carriers  of  non-functional  (107/133)  or  partially  func-
tional  (21/133)  variants,  with  an  average  age  of  tumor 
manifestation of 39.2 (95% CI: 36.7–41.8) and 48.7 (95% 
CI:  42.3–55.1)  y.o.  respectively.  Functional  and  super-
functional  variants  (5/133)  in  breast  cancer  patients  are 
classified as benign or likely benign according to ACMG 
criteria.

Thus, functional features of the p53 protein determined 
in cell culture experiments can help determine the clini-
cal significance of different TP53 mutations.

Conclusion
Our  study  presents  a  spectrum  of  pathogenic  and  likely 
pathogenic germline variants of the TP53 gene in a large 
cohort  of  Russian  patients  diagnosed  with  various  can-
cers, along with clinical characteristics and family onco-
logical history of carrier patients. All clinically significant 
TP53 gene variants were identified in women with breast 
cancer (including bilateral breast cancer and breast can-
cer  as  part  of  multiple  primary  malignant  neoplasms). 
Only  5  out  of  13  mutation  carriers  (38.5%)  met  modi-
fied  Chompret  criteria,  indicating  candidates  for  molec-
ular-genetic  testing  of  the  TP53  gene. Therefore,  relying 
solely  on  these  criteria  in  clinical  practice  for  determin-
ing indications for genetic testing would fail to identify a 
half of the mutation’s carriers. This conclusion should be 
considered in medical-genetic counseling and molecular-
genetic searches in cases of suspected hereditary cancer, 
particularly  LFS  syndrome  in  patients  diagnosed  with 
breast cancer.
