REGULAR ARTICLE TP53 mutations predict for poor outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed aggressive B-cell lymphomas in the current era Daniel J. Landsburg,1 Jennifer JD Morrissette,2 Sunita D. Nasta,1 Stefan K. Barta,1 Stephen J. Schuster,1 Jakub Svoboda,1 Elise A. Chong,1 and Adam Bagg2 1Lymphoma Program, Abramson Cancer Center and 2Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Key Points (cid:129) TP53 mutations are independently associated with inferior PFS, even in the presence of other highrisk features. (cid:129) CLMA can reliably and rapidly identify genetic mutations, which may inform patient management. Genetic subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been identiﬁed through comprehensive genomic analysis; however, it is unclear whether this can be applied in clinical practice. We assessed whether mutations detected by clinical laboratory mutation analysis (CLMA) were predictive of outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/highgrade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL). Patients diagnosed from 2018 to 2022 whose biopsy samples were subjected to CLMA and who received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone or rituximab plus etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin were analyzed for overall/complete response rate (ORR/CRR) and estimated progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS). CLMA was successfully performed in 117 of 122 patient samples (96%), with a median turnaround time of 17 days. Median duration of follow-up was 31.3 months. Of the mutations detected in ≥10% of the samples, only TP53 was associated with both progression and death at 2 years. TP53 mutations were detected in 36% of tumors, and patients with TP53 mutations experienced signiﬁcantly lower ORR (71% vs 90%; P = .009), CRR (55% vs 77%; P = .01), 2-year PFS (57% vs 77%; P = .006), 2-year OS (70% vs 91%; P = .001), and median OS after relapse (6.1 months vs not yet reached; P = .001) as than those without TP53 mutations. Furthermore, patients with TP53 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations experienced lower rates of 2-year PFS/OS than those with non-LOF mutations and inferior or near-inferior 2-year PFS if harboring high-risk clinicopathologic features. TP53 mutations identiﬁed through CLMA can predict for inferior outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/HGBL. Results of CLMA can be used in real time to inform prognosis and/or identify candidates for clinical trials. Although approximately two-thirds of patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are cured after receipt of ﬁrstline immunochemotherapy, efforts to predict those at risk of developing relapsed/refractory disease are needed, given that the majority of patients who are not cured will die of complications from lymphoma. Molecular testing performed on biopsy samples from patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL has identiﬁed subgroups of patients with inferior survival after receipt of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP), including those with activated B-cell cell of origin as per gene expression proﬁling1 and those with MYC rearrangements with or Submitted 4 August 2023; accepted 7 October 2023; prepublished online on Blood Advances Edition First bloodadvances.2023011384. 18 October 2023.

We aimed to determine whether any individual recurring genetic mutations detected in tumors from patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) through clinical laboratory mutation analysis (CLMA) were predictive of response ﬁrstline and after survival immunochemotherapy. treatment with outcomes Methods Inclusion criteria for this analysis were patients diagnosed with DLBCL/HGBL (either de novo or transformed indolent lymphoma with non–small cell lymphocytic histology without receipt of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy) between January 2018 and July 2022 who received either standard-dose R-CHOP or rituximab with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) as ﬁrstline therapy and had mutation analysis performed on their initial diagnostic biopsy sample with 1 of 2 lymphoma-focused gene sequencing panels at the Penn Center for Personalized Diagnostics at the University of Pennsylvania (lymphoma sequencing panel [LSP] from 2018 to 2020 and PennSeq lymphoma panel [PSLP] from 2020 to 2022), details of which are provided in the supplemental Materials. Exclusion criteria included death due to nonlymphoma causes during ﬁrstline therapy and loss to follow-up <1 year after diagnosis if in remission. Institutional standards for pathologic evaluation and diagnosis of tumor biopsy specimen included immunohistochemical staining for CD10, BCL6, and MUM1, among other makers, with the cell of origin assigned by Hans algorithm12 as well as FISH for MYC rearrangement, with reﬂex testing for BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangement if tested positive. Therapy was administered at the discretion of the treating physician. Disease response by computed tomography with or without positron emission tomography was determined using Lugano classiﬁcation.13 PFS was deﬁned as the interval between diagnosis of DLBCL/HGBL and relapse of DLBCL/HGBL or last follow-up in remission. OS was deﬁned as the interval between diagnosis of DLBCL/HGBL and death due to any cause or last follow-up while alive. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and survival analysis was performed using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were (OS) after laboratories through massively parallel sequencing, More recently, comprehensive genomic analyses performed on biopsy specimen from patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL have classiﬁed tumors into multiple genetic subgroups, some of which are associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and receipt of R-CHOP.7,8 Although overall survival comprehensive genomic analysis is not currently feasible to perform in clinical practice, mutation analysis can be performed in the clinical result of which may aid in assignment of a genetic subgroup to some tumors through the LymphGen platform.9 One analysis of targeted mutational analysis performed on biopsy specimen from a large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL identiﬁed genetic subgroups with similarities to those characterized through comprehensive genomic analyses; however, when restricted to patients treated with R-CHOP, a poor-risk genetic subgroup was not clearly identiﬁed.10 Additionally, given the heterogeneity of mutations detected within genetic subgroups, it is unclear that a common signaling pathway is altered in all tumors within a genetic subgroup or that it would be to combine a speciﬁc targeted therapy with ﬁrstline practical immunochemotherapy for all patients with DLBCL whose tumors are classiﬁed within a genetic subgroup. However, a subset analysis of the PHOENIX trial revealed that patients with DLBCL aged ≤60 years whose tumors were classiﬁed into MCD (9%) or N1 (4%) genetic subgroups experience signiﬁcantly improved PFS and OS if treated with R-CHOP plus ibrutinib as compared with those treated with R-CHOP alone.11 Furthermore, many mutations are commonly found within multiple genetic subgroups, and combining a speciﬁc targeted therapy with ﬁrstline immunochemotherapy for patients with DLBCL whose tumors are classiﬁed in the genetic subgroup characterized by a given mutation may disregard those who harbor the mutation but are classiﬁed in other subgroups. For example, although nearly 90% of A53 tumors harbor a TP53 mutation, this mutation is also detected in ~20% to 50% of tumors classiﬁed in other genetic subgroups, and given that the prevalence of the A53 genetic subtype is only 6.6%,9 restricting an experimental therapy targeting TP53 only to patients whose tumors are classiﬁed as A53 would 0.4 0.35 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 M 2 B 3 5 P T 1 S C O S P B B E R C 4 1 F S R F N T 3 1 A N G 1 R X 1 L B T C Y M A T C I 1 R E C D I 2 L C B 2 H Z E M T A I 3 P A F N T 1 1 D R A C 8 8 D Y M 3 F C T A C N A F X 3 X D D M C N A F 1 P B T E S I E B K F N B 9 7 D C F A R B 1 A C R B 2 A C R B A 3 T M N D 6 F H P 6 L H L K 2 G C L P 2 H C T O N 1 H C T O N 1 K 2 P A M 2 T E T 3 T A T S N E T P 4 X L S I T K R O C B R 3 F S C 1 K P A M 1 F S 2 F L K 1 A 3 F S A 9 7 D C 4 R C X C 1 O P X 3 D I 3 K A J A O H R 1 L X S A 1 L R O C B 3 P N R B I 6 V T E L B C 3 T L F 2 A T A G 1 F Z K I 2 B L A P 2 F S R S A R F G D P Figure 1.

Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as a 2-tailed P value < .05. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Data were censored on 1 July 2023. This protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania. In total, 137 patients were initially included, with 15 subsequently excluded (8 because of death from nonlymphoma causes during ﬁrstline therapy, and 7 because of becoming lost to follow-up <1 year after diagnosis when in remission), and 117 of 122 patient biopsy samples underwent successful CLMA (LSP for 55 and PSLP for 62), with a success rate of 96%. Median time from receipt of biopsy in the genomics laboratory to report release (turnaround time) was 17 days. Analyzed samples of successful assays were parafﬁn-embedded tissue for 102, bone marrow for 12, and cytology for 3. Request for performing mutation analysis as per the review of the patient’s medical record for successful assays was made by the interpreting hematopathologist for 107 patients (101 as part of routine evaluation and 6 speciﬁcally to aid in rendering a diagnosis) and the treating clinician for 10 patients. A histogram depicting the frequency of mutations detected in ≥3% of cases tested is shown in Figure 1, and variants detected in each tumor are listed in supplemental Table 1. 12 DECEMBER 2023 • VOLUME 7, NUMBER 23 TP53 MUTATIONS IN AGGRESSIVE B-CELL LYMPHOMAS 7245 Baseline characteristics, including mutations occurring in ≥10% of cases tested as well as subgroup classiﬁcation by LymphGen 2.0 based on available molecular data, are listed in Table 1. Additionally, individual patient tumor characteristics are shown in Figure 2. R-CHOP was received by 73 patients (62%), and R-EPOCH by 44 patients (38%). For all patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 84% (69% complete response rate [CRR] and 15% partial response rate). With a median follow-up of 31.3 months, the estimated 2-year PFS was 70% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 60-78), estimated 2-year OS was 83% (95% CI, 74-89), and estimated median OS after relapse was 21.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 to not yet reached). Univariate Cox regression analysis of characteristics listed in Table 1 identiﬁed HGBL classiﬁcation, MYC rearrangement, and TP53 mutation as signiﬁcantly predictive of progression at 2 years; however, of these characteristics, only TP53 mutation remained predictive on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8; P = .03). Additionally, univariate analysis identiﬁed International Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≥ 3, HGBL classiﬁcation, MYC rearrangement, MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma, TP53 mutation, and TNFRSF14 mutation as signiﬁcantly predictive of death at 2 years; however, of these characteristics, only HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1-22.7; P = .04) and MYC rearrangement (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.0-18.0; P = .04) remained predictive on multivariate analysis. Given that TP53 mutations predicted for both progression and death at 2 years, we explored the characteristics of these mutations. Forty-nine TP53 mutations were detected in 42 patient samples (36% of patients) and were classiﬁed as missense in 34, frameshift in 6, nonsense in 6, splice site in 2, and other in 1. Fortytwo (86%) TP53 mutations were deemed loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, either as a missense mutation designated as nonfunctional and/or LOF via query of The TP53 Database or any nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutation as per ClinVar and/or PVS1 criteria for predicted LOF variants14 as well as existing literature.15 Details of each TP53 mutation are listed in Table 2. Comparison of baseline characteristics of patients with (n = 42) vs without (n = 75) any TP53 mutation is listed in Table 3. The proportion of patients receiving R-CHOP/R-EPOCH was similar for patients with vs without TP53 mutations (61%/39% vs 64%/36%; P = .84). For patients with vs without TP53 mutations, the ORR was 71% (55% CRR) vs 90% (77% CRR; P = .009 for ORR and P = .01 for CRR); estimated 2-year PFS was 57% (95% CI, 40-70) vs 77% (95% CI, 65-86; P = .006), as depicted in Figure 3A; estimated 2year OS was 70% (95% CI, 53-82) vs 91% (95% CI, 80-96; P = .001), as depicted in Figure 3B; and estimated median OS after relapse was 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.2-11.5) vs not yet reached (95% CI, 16.3 to not yet reached; P = .01), as depicted in Figure 3C. Additionally, for patients with TP53 mutations treated with R-CHOP vs R-EPOCH, the estimated 2-year PFS was 70% (95% CI, 49-84), vs 33% (95% CI, 12-56; P = .01) and estimated 2-year OS was 85% (95% CI, 64-94), vs 43% (95% CI, 17-67; P = .001), as depicted in supplemental Figure 1. This ﬁnding is likely because of the fact that patients with TP53 mutations who were treated with R-EPOCH (n = 15) were more likely to have unfavorable baseline characteristics, speciﬁcally an IPI score ≥ 3 (80% vs 44%; P = .049), HGBL classiﬁcation (73% vs 7%; P = .049), MYC rearrangement (87% vs 0%; P = .049), and MYCBCL2 double-hit lymphoma (40% vs 0%; P = .049), than those with TP53 mutations treated with R-CHOP (n = 27). In terms of TP53 variant allele frequency (VAF), we analyzed survival outcomes based on quartiles, with 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of 21%, 35%, and 50% VAF, respectively. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the estimated 2-year PFS for patients with TP53 VAF falling within quartile 1 (70%; 95% CI, 33-89) vs quartile 2 (45%; 95% CI, 17-71) vs quartile 3 (48%; 95% CI, 16-75) vs Histology Cell of origin MYC rearrangement MYC-BCL2 double hit TP53 mutation SOCS1 mutation B2M mutation CREBBP mutation TNFRSF14 mutation TBL1XR1 mutation GNA13 mutation MYC mutation CIITA mutation DICER1 mutation BCL2 mutation EZH2 mutation ATM mutation TNFAIP3 mutation CARD11 mutation Other subgroup EZB subgroup MCD subgroup ST2 subgroup Figure 2.

For the subset of patients with TP53 mutations, HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4-8.8; P = .01) was signiﬁcantly predictive of progression at 2 years on univariate Cox regression analysis, whereas HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.2; P = .02) and MYC rearrangement (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.2; P = .02) were signiﬁcantly predictive of death at 2 years on univariate analysis; however neither remained predictive of death at 2 years on multivariate analysis. Similarly, for the subset of patients with TP53 LOF mutations, HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.38.7; P = .01) was signiﬁcantly predictive of progression at 2 years on univariate analysis whereas HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.0-10.1; P = .046) and MYC rearrangement (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.0-10.1; P = .046) were signiﬁcantly predictive of death at 2 years on univariate analysis; however neither remained predictive of death at 2 years on multivariate analysis. Because TP53 mutations were predictive of inferior estimated 2year PFS on multivariate regression and patients with TP53 LOF mutations experienced a lower rate of estimated 2-year PFS than those with non-LOF mutations, an exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate whether TP53 LOF mutations were predictive of estimated 2-year PFS for subsets of patients with high-risk clinicopathologic features. Estimated 2-year PFS for patients with and without TP53 LOF mutations was 42% (95% CI, 20-62) vs 80% (95% CI, 61-90; P = .009), respectively, for the subset with an IPI score ≥ 3, as depicted in Figure 4A; 25% (95% CI, 6-50) vs 70% (95% CI, 33-89; P = .046), respectively, for the subset with HGBL classiﬁcation, as depicted in Figure 4B; 53% (95% CI, 2571) vs 81% (95% CI, 66-90; P = .01), respectively, for the subset with non-GCB cell of origin, as depicted in Figure 4C; 33% (95% CI, 10-59) vs 48% (95% CI, 9-81; P = .17), respectively, for the subset with MYC rearrangement, as depicted in Figure 4D; 40% (95% CI, 5-75) vs 67% (95% CI, 19-90; P = .34), respectively, for the subset with MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma, as depicted in Figure 4E, and 30% (95% CI, 7-58) vs 72% (95% CI, 51-85; P = .04), respectively, for the subset with EZB genetic classiﬁcation, as depicted in Figure 4F. Although an external validation cohort was not available, analysis of survival outcomes by TP53 LOF mutation status for patients whose tumors were analyzed by LSP vs PSLP was conducted, as depicted in supplemental Figure 2. For patients whose tumors underwent LSP who had a median length of follow-up of 42.6 months, the estimated 2-year PFS for those with at least 1 TP53 LOF mutation (n = 15) vs no TP53 LOF mutation (n = 40) was 47% (95% CI, 21-69) vs 80% (95% CI, 64-89; P = .008), 7248 LANDSBURG et al 12 DECEMBER 2023 • VOLUME 7, NUMBER 23 Table 3.

Among patients whose tumor samples underwent PSLP who had a median duration of follow-up of 20 months, the estimated 2-year PFS for those with at least 1 TP53 LOF mutation (n = 20) vs no TP53 LOF mutation (n = 42) was 55% (95% CI, 31-73) vs 74% (95% CI, 5387; P = .03), respectively, and the estimated 2-year OS was 65% (95% CI, 40-81) vs 92% (95% CI, 68-98; P = .009), respectively,. TP53 mutations have been historically reported to be predictive of inferior survival in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL whose tumors harbor these mutations. Most notably, >100 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL with tumors harboring TP53 mutations experienced inferior PFS and OS as compared with those without TP53 mutations when treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOP–like therapy, as identiﬁed through the International DLBCL RituximabCHOP Consortium Program.15 A similar ﬁnding was reported through an analysis of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL included in the RICOVER-60 trial, which included ~60 patients with tumors harboring TP53 mutations.16 Smaller studies of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL have demonstrated similar results.17-20 Interestingly, the aforementioned report of targeted the EZH2 promoter mutational analysis performed on biopsy samples from a large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL reported an inferior OS for patients whose tumors were classiﬁed into some of their proposed genetic subgroups if demonstrating TP53 mutation.10 Another report of genetic classiﬁcation of DLBCL tumors using a 38-gene LymphPlex algorithm deﬁned 1 genetic subgroup characterized solely based upon the presence of TP53 mutation, which was associated with a lower rate of PFS than other subgroups.21 TP53 and p53 protein have been described as “undruggable” because of failure of targeted agents to be clinically effective in patients with TP53-mutated cancers and because that the desirable therapeutic outcome would be to restore the normal conformation of mutated p53 protein, which is overexpressed in TP53mutated tumors, which is not a typical mechanism of action for small-molecule inhibitors.22 However, a strong association between increased expression of both p53 and EZH2 protein in tumors of patients with DLBCL has been reported,23 and p53induced suppression of leading to cell senescence does not occur in cells harboring TP53 mutations in vitro,24 suggesting that EZH2 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with TP53-mutated DLBCL/ HGBL. Furthermore, gene expression proﬁling of TP53-mutated tumors of patients with DLBCL identiﬁed activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling,21 which could support investigation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors for patients with TP53mutated DLBCL/HGBL. Finally, RNA sequencing demonstrated downregulation of interferon and apoptosis pathways as well as CD8+ T-cell inﬁltration in DLBCL tumors with TP53 mutations as compared with tumors without,25 and interestingly, a small number of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL harboring TP53 mutations experienced a high overall response rate as well as increased expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as serum interferon gamma levels after treatment with R-CHOP plus decitabine,26 suggesting that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may beneﬁt patients with TP53-mutated DLBCL/HGBL. Classiﬁcation of TP53 mutations as LOF vs non-LOF is notable as an effort to identify patients whose tumors are likely to develop as a result of dysregulation of TP53. The presence of a high-risk genetic alteration in a DLBCL/HGBL tumor does not necessarily equate with abnormal protein synthesis, and it is not clear that all patients with such an alteration in their tumors experience inferior survival if this is treated with standard-of-care therapy. One example of patients diagnosed with double-hit lymphoma harboring MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma), who are typically treated with R-EPOCH or other intensive therapies in the ﬁrstline setting; however, patients with MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma whose tumors demonstrate non–MYC-IG rearrangement have a similar prognosis to those without MYC-BCL2 doublehit lymphoma when treated with R-CHOP.6 Additional strengths of our analysis are inclusion of patients with HGBL tumors as well as those treated with R-EPOCH, reﬂecting current practice in the diagnosis and treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, analyses of subgroups of patients with high-risk features revealed that the presence of TP53 LOF mutations may further discriminate PFS, supporting exploration of efﬁcacy outcomes for patients with TP53 LOF mutations enrolled on clinical trials investigating novel ﬁrstline treatment regimens for high-risk DLBCL/HGBL.

Ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating the beneﬁt of venetoclax added to R-CHOP (NCT03984448) and acalabrutinib added to R-CHOP (NCT04529772) for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/HGBL allow 1 cycle of R-CHOP to be administered while conﬁrming pathologic testing before study arm assignment at the start of cycle 2. Weaknesses of our analysis include a smaller sample size of patients as well as the use of more limited gene panels as compared with some other published studies, which might have limited our ability to identify other mutations that predict for inferior clinical outcomes in this patient population. Additionally, although we did not analyze an external validation cohort of patients, it is notable that patients with TP53 LOF mutations experienced inferior estimated 2-year PFS and OS as compared with those without TP53 LOF mutations when analyzed as 2 separate cohorts based upon sequencing panel performed. Finally, it is likely that some patient tumors in our series were misclassiﬁed as “other” as per LymphGen because of our inability to detect all mutations as well as rearrangements and copy number changes included in this predictive algorithm. Although it would be ideal if all clinical laboratories used identical algorithms for characterizing TP53 LOF mutations detected in DLBCL/HGBL tumors, this is unlikely to be the case in current practice, as suggested by reporting of different algorithms used for characterization of TP53 mutations in tumors from patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.27-29 We feel it is relevant to offer a framework for doing so, mainly using searchable online databases in hopes that this could contribute to development of a standardized and reproducible reporting algorithm for classiﬁcation of TP53 mutations in DLBCL/ HGBL tumors. Additional efforts to analyze p53 expression by immunohistochemical staining, and del17p status by FISH may also be informative in this effort. In conclusion, TP53 mutations as detected by CLMA predict for inferior outcomes, most notably inferior estimated 2-year PFS on multivariable analysis, in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/ HGBL treated with R-CHOP or R-EPOCH. Additionally, TP53 LOF mutations predict for inferior estimated 2-year PFS in high-risk
