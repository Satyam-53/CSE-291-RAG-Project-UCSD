Key Points

(cid:129) TP53 mutations are

independently
associated with inferior
PFS, even in the
presence of other high-
risk features.

(cid:129) CLMA can reliably and
rapidly identify genetic
mutations, which may
inform patient
management.

Genetic subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been identiﬁed through
comprehensive genomic analysis; however, it is unclear whether this can be applied in

clinical practice. We assessed whether mutations detected by clinical laboratory mutation

analysis (CLMA) were predictive of outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/high-

grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL). Patients diagnosed from 2018 to 2022 whose biopsy samples

were subjected to CLMA and who received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,

vincristine, and prednisone or rituximab plus etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine,

cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin were analyzed for overall/complete response rate

(ORR/CRR) and estimated progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS). CLMA was successfully

performed in 117 of 122 patient samples (96%), with a median turnaround time of 17 days.
Median duration of follow-up was 31.3 months. Of the mutations detected in ≥10% of the
samples, only TP53 was associated with both progression and death at 2 years. TP53
mutations were detected in 36% of tumors, and patients with TP53 mutations experienced
signiﬁcantly lower ORR (71% vs 90%; P = .009), CRR (55% vs 77%; P = .01), 2-year PFS (57% vs
77%; P = .006), 2-year OS (70% vs 91%; P = .001), and median OS after relapse (6.1 months vs
not yet reached; P = .001) as than those without TP53 mutations. Furthermore, patients with
TP53 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations experienced lower rates of 2-year PFS/OS than those
with non-LOF mutations and inferior or near-inferior 2-year PFS if harboring high-risk
clinicopathologic features. TP53 mutations identiﬁed through CLMA can predict for inferior
outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/HGBL. Results of CLMA can be used in

real time to inform prognosis and/or identify candidates for clinical trials.

Introduction

Although approximately two-thirds of patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
are cured after receipt of ﬁrstline immunochemotherapy, efforts to predict those at risk of developing
relapsed/refractory disease are needed, given that the majority of patients who are not cured will die of
complications from lymphoma. Molecular testing performed on biopsy samples from patients with newly
diagnosed DLBCL has identiﬁed subgroups of patients with inferior survival after receipt of rituximab
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP), including those with acti-
vated B-cell cell of origin as per gene expression proﬁling1 and those with MYC rearrangements with or

We aimed to determine whether any individual recurring genetic

Methods

Inclusion criteria for this analysis were patients diagnosed with
DLBCL/HGBL (either de novo or transformed indolent lymphoma
with non–small cell lymphocytic histology without receipt of prior
cytotoxic chemotherapy) between January 2018 and July 2022
who received either standard-dose R-CHOP or rituximab with
etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxo-
rubicin (R-EPOCH) as ﬁrstline therapy and had mutation analysis
performed on their initial diagnostic biopsy sample with 1 of 2
lymphoma-focused gene sequencing panels at the Penn Center for
Personalized Diagnostics at the University of Pennsylvania (lym-
phoma sequencing panel [LSP] from 2018 to 2020 and PennSeq
lymphoma panel [PSLP] from 2020 to 2022), details of which are
provided in the supplemental Materials. Exclusion criteria included
death due to nonlymphoma causes during ﬁrstline therapy and loss
to follow-up <1 year after diagnosis if in remission.

Institutional standards for pathologic evaluation and diagnosis of
tumor biopsy specimen included immunohistochemical staining for
CD10, BCL6, and MUM1, among other makers, with the cell of
origin assigned by Hans algorithm12 as well as FISH for MYC
rearrangement, with reﬂex testing for BCL2 and BCL6 rear-
rangement if tested positive. Therapy was administered at the
discretion of the treating physician. Disease response by computed
tomography with or without positron emission tomography was
determined using Lugano classiﬁcation.13 PFS was deﬁned as the
interval between diagnosis of DLBCL/HGBL and relapse of
DLBCL/HGBL or last follow-up in remission. OS was deﬁned as
the interval between diagnosis of DLBCL/HGBL and death due to
any cause or last follow-up while alive. Survival curves were plotted
using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and survival analysis was performed
using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were

laboratories through massively parallel sequencing,

More recently, comprehensive genomic analyses performed on
biopsy specimen from patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL have
classiﬁed tumors into multiple genetic subgroups, some of which
are associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and
receipt of R-CHOP.7,8 Although
overall survival
comprehensive genomic analysis is not currently feasible to
perform in clinical practice, mutation analysis can be performed in
the
clinical
result of which may aid in assignment of a genetic subgroup to
some tumors through the LymphGen platform.9 One analysis of
targeted mutational analysis performed on biopsy specimen from a
large cohort of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL identiﬁed
genetic subgroups with similarities to those characterized through
comprehensive genomic analyses; however, when restricted to
patients treated with R-CHOP, a poor-risk genetic subgroup was
not clearly identiﬁed.10

Additionally, given the heterogeneity of mutations detected within
genetic subgroups, it is unclear that a common signaling pathway
is altered in all tumors within a genetic subgroup or that it would be
to combine a speciﬁc targeted therapy with ﬁrstline
practical
immunochemotherapy for all patients with DLBCL whose tumors
are classiﬁed within a genetic subgroup. However, a subset anal-
ysis of the PHOENIX trial revealed that patients with DLBCL aged
≤60 years whose tumors were classiﬁed into MCD (9%) or N1
(4%) genetic subgroups experience signiﬁcantly improved PFS
and OS if treated with R-CHOP plus ibrutinib as compared with
those treated with R-CHOP alone.11

Furthermore, many mutations are commonly found within multiple
genetic subgroups, and combining a speciﬁc targeted therapy with
ﬁrstline immunochemotherapy for patients with DLBCL whose
tumors are classiﬁed in the genetic subgroup characterized by a
given mutation may disregard those who harbor the mutation but
are classiﬁed in other subgroups. For example, although nearly
90% of A53 tumors harbor a TP53 mutation, this mutation is also
detected in ~20% to 50% of tumors classiﬁed in other genetic
subgroups, and given that the prevalence of the A53 genetic
subtype is only 6.6%,9 restricting an experimental therapy targeting
TP53 only to patients whose tumors are classiﬁed as A53 would

performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression. Categorical
variables were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance was deﬁned as a 2-tailed P value < .05. All statistical ana-
lyses were performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX). Data were censored on 1 July 2023. This protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of the University of
Pennsylvania.

Results

In total, 137 patients were initially included, with 15 subsequently
excluded (8 because of death from nonlymphoma causes during
ﬁrstline therapy, and 7 because of becoming lost to follow-up <1
year after diagnosis when in remission), and 117 of 122 patient
biopsy samples underwent successful CLMA (LSP for 55 and
PSLP for 62), with a success rate of 96%. Median time from
receipt of biopsy in the genomics laboratory to report release
(turnaround time) was 17 days. Analyzed samples of successful
assays were parafﬁn-embedded tissue for 102, bone marrow for
12, and cytology for 3. Request for performing mutation analysis as
per the review of the patient’s medical record for successful assays
was made by the interpreting hematopathologist for 107 patients
(101 as part of routine evaluation and 6 speciﬁcally to aid in
rendering a diagnosis) and the treating clinician for 10 patients. A
histogram depicting the frequency of mutations detected in ≥3%
of cases tested is shown in Figure 1, and variants detected in each
tumor are listed in supplemental Table 1.

TP53 MUTATIONS IN AGGRESSIVE B-CELL LYMPHOMAS 7245

Baseline characteristics, including mutations occurring in ≥10% of
cases tested as well as subgroup classiﬁcation by LymphGen 2.0
based on available molecular data, are listed in Table 1. Addition-
ally, individual patient tumor characteristics are shown in Figure 2.
R-CHOP was received by 73 patients (62%), and R-EPOCH by 44
patients (38%).

For all patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 84% (69%
complete response rate [CRR] and 15% partial response rate).
With a median follow-up of 31.3 months, the estimated 2-year PFS
was 70% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 60-78), estimated 2-year
OS was 83% (95% CI, 74-89), and estimated median OS after
relapse was 21.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 to not yet reached). Uni-
variate Cox regression analysis of characteristics listed in Table 1
identiﬁed HGBL classiﬁcation, MYC rearrangement, and TP53
mutation as signiﬁcantly predictive of progression at 2 years;
however, of these characteristics, only TP53 mutation remained
predictive on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3; 95% CI,
1.1-4.8; P = .03). Additionally, univariate analysis identiﬁed Inter-
national Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≥ 3, HGBL classiﬁcation,
MYC rearrangement, MYC-BCL2 double-hit
lymphoma, TP53
mutation, and TNFRSF14 mutation as signiﬁcantly predictive of
death at 2 years; however, of these characteristics, only HGBL
classiﬁcation (HR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1-22.7; P = .04) and MYC
rearrangement (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.0-18.0; P = .04) remained
predictive on multivariate analysis.

Given that TP53 mutations predicted for both progression and
death at 2 years, we explored the characteristics of these muta-
tions. Forty-nine TP53 mutations were detected in 42 patient
samples (36% of patients) and were classiﬁed as missense in 34,
frameshift in 6, nonsense in 6, splice site in 2, and other in 1. Forty-
two (86%) TP53 mutations were deemed loss-of-function (LOF)
mutations, either as a missense mutation designated as nonfunc-
tional and/or LOF via query of The TP53 Database or any
nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutation as per ClinVar and/or

PVS1 criteria for predicted LOF variants14 as well as existing
literature.15 Details of each TP53 mutation are listed in Table 2.

Comparison of baseline characteristics of patients with (n = 42) vs
without (n = 75) any TP53 mutation is listed in Table 3. The pro-
portion of patients receiving R-CHOP/R-EPOCH was similar for
patients with vs without TP53 mutations (61%/39% vs 64%/36%;
P = .84).

For patients with vs without TP53 mutations, the ORR was 71%
(55% CRR) vs 90% (77% CRR; P = .009 for ORR and P = .01 for
CRR); estimated 2-year PFS was 57% (95% CI, 40-70) vs 77%
(95% CI, 65-86; P = .006), as depicted in Figure 3A; estimated 2-
year OS was 70% (95% CI, 53-82) vs 91% (95% CI, 80-96; P =
.001), as depicted in Figure 3B; and estimated median OS after
relapse was 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.2-11.5) vs not yet reached
(95% CI, 16.3 to not yet reached; P = .01), as depicted in
Figure 3C. Additionally, for patients with TP53 mutations treated
with R-CHOP vs R-EPOCH, the estimated 2-year PFS was 70%
(95% CI, 49-84), vs 33% (95% CI, 12-56; P = .01) and estimated
2-year OS was 85% (95% CI, 64-94), vs 43% (95% CI, 17-67;
P = .001), as depicted in supplemental Figure 1. This ﬁnding is
likely because of the fact that patients with TP53 mutations who
were treated with R-EPOCH (n = 15) were more likely to have
unfavorable baseline characteristics, speciﬁcally an IPI score ≥ 3
(80% vs 44%; P = .049), HGBL classiﬁcation (73% vs 7%; P =
.049), MYC rearrangement (87% vs 0%; P = .049), and MYC-
BCL2 double-hit lymphoma (40% vs 0%; P = .049), than those
with TP53 mutations treated with R-CHOP (n = 27).

In terms of TP53 variant allele frequency (VAF), we analyzed sur-
vival outcomes based on quartiles, with 25th, 50th, and 75th per-
centiles of 21%, 35%, and 50% VAF, respectively. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in the estimated 2-year PFS for patients with
TP53 VAF falling within quartile 1 (70%; 95% CI, 33-89) vs quartile
2 (45%; 95% CI, 17-71) vs quartile 3 (48%; 95% CI, 16-75) vs

quartile 4 (64%; 95% CI, 30-85; P = .53). Similarly, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the estimated 2-year OS for patients with
TP53 VAF falling within quartile 1 (80%; 95% CI, 41-95) vs quartile
2 (61%; 95% CI, 25-83) vs quartile 3 (70%; 95% CI, 33-89) vs
quartile 4 (73%; 95% CI, 37-90; P = .78). Additionally,7 patients
had biallelic TP53 mutations, 6 of whom developed progressive
disease.

For patients with at least 1 TP53 LOF mutation (n = 35) vs only
TP53 non-LOF mutation (n = 7) vs without TP53 mutation (n = 75),
the estimated 2-year PFS was 51% (95% CI, 34-66) vs 86%
(95% CI, 33-98) vs 77% (95% CI, 63-84; P = .002), as depicted in
Figure 3D, and the estimated 2-year OS was 64% (95% CI, 46-78)
vs 100% (95% CI, not calculable) vs 91% (95% CI, 80-96; P =
.004), as depicted in Figure 3E.
For the subset of patients with TP53 mutations, HGBL classiﬁca-
tion (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4-8.8; P = .01) was signiﬁcantly predictive
of progression at 2 years on univariate Cox regression analysis,
whereas HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.2; P = .02)
and MYC rearrangement (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.2; P = .02)
were signiﬁcantly predictive of death at 2 years on univariate
analysis; however neither remained predictive of death at 2 years
on multivariate analysis. Similarly, for the subset of patients with
TP53 LOF mutations, HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-
8.7; P = .01) was signiﬁcantly predictive of progression at 2 years
on univariate analysis whereas HGBL classiﬁcation (HR, 3.2;
95% CI, 1.0-10.1; P = .046) and MYC rearrangement (HR, 3.2;
95% CI, 1.0-10.1; P = .046) were signiﬁcantly predictive of death
at 2 years on univariate analysis; however neither remained pre-
dictive of death at 2 years on multivariate analysis.

Because TP53 mutations were predictive of inferior estimated 2-
year PFS on multivariate regression and patients with TP53 LOF
mutations experienced a lower rate of estimated 2-year PFS than
those with non-LOF mutations, an exploratory analysis was per-
formed to evaluate whether TP53 LOF mutations were predictive
of estimated 2-year PFS for subsets of patients with high-risk
clinicopathologic features. Estimated 2-year PFS for patients with
and without TP53 LOF mutations was 42% (95% CI, 20-62) vs
80% (95% CI, 61-90; P = .009), respectively, for the subset with
an IPI score ≥ 3, as depicted in Figure 4A; 25% (95% CI, 6-50) vs
70% (95% CI, 33-89; P = .046), respectively, for the subset with
HGBL classiﬁcation, as depicted in Figure 4B; 53% (95% CI, 25-
71) vs 81% (95% CI, 66-90; P = .01), respectively, for the subset
with non-GCB cell of origin, as depicted in Figure 4C; 33%
(95% CI, 10-59) vs 48% (95% CI, 9-81; P = .17), respectively, for
the subset with MYC rearrangement, as depicted in Figure 4D;
40% (95% CI, 5-75) vs 67% (95% CI, 19-90; P = .34), respec-
tively, for the subset with MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma, as
depicted in Figure 4E, and 30% (95% CI, 7-58) vs 72% (95% CI,
51-85; P = .04), respectively, for the subset with EZB genetic
classiﬁcation, as depicted in Figure 4F.

Although an external validation cohort was not available, analysis of
survival outcomes by TP53 LOF mutation status for patients whose
tumors were analyzed by LSP vs PSLP was conducted, as
depicted in supplemental Figure 2. For patients whose tumors
underwent LSP who had a median length of
follow-up of
42.6 months, the estimated 2-year PFS for those with at least 1
TP53 LOF mutation (n = 15) vs no TP53 LOF mutation (n = 40)
was 47% (95% CI, 21-69) vs 80% (95% CI, 64-89; P = .008),

duration of follow-up of 20 months, the estimated 2-year PFS for
those with at least 1 TP53 LOF mutation (n = 20) vs no TP53 LOF
mutation (n = 42) was 55% (95% CI, 31-73) vs 74% (95% CI, 53-

Discussion

TP53 mutations have been historically reported to be predictive of
inferior survival
in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL whose
tumors harbor these mutations. Most notably, >100 patients with
newly diagnosed DLBCL with tumors harboring TP53 mutations
experienced inferior PFS and OS as compared with those without
TP53 mutations when treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOP–like
therapy, as identiﬁed through the International DLBCL Rituximab-
CHOP Consortium Program.15 A similar ﬁnding was reported
through an analysis of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL
included in the RICOVER-60 trial, which included ~60 patients
with tumors harboring TP53 mutations.16 Smaller studies of
patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL have demonstrated similar
results.17-20 Interestingly, the aforementioned report of targeted

the EZH2 promoter

mutational analysis performed on biopsy samples from a large
cohort of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL reported an infe-
rior OS for patients whose tumors were classiﬁed into some of their
proposed genetic subgroups if demonstrating TP53 mutation.10
Another report of genetic classiﬁcation of DLBCL tumors using a
38-gene LymphPlex algorithm deﬁned 1 genetic subgroup char-
acterized solely based upon the presence of TP53 mutation, which
was associated with a lower rate of PFS than other subgroups.21
TP53 and p53 protein have been described as “undruggable”
because of failure of targeted agents to be clinically effective in
patients with TP53-mutated cancers and because that the desir-
able therapeutic outcome would be to restore the normal confor-
mation of mutated p53 protein, which is overexpressed in TP53-
mutated tumors, which is not a typical mechanism of action for
small-molecule inhibitors.22 However,
a strong association
between increased expression of both p53 and EZH2 protein in
tumors of patients with DLBCL has been reported,23 and p53-
induced suppression of
leading to cell
senescence does not occur in cells harboring TP53 mutations
in vitro,24 suggesting that EZH2 inhibition may be an effective
therapeutic strategy for patients with TP53-mutated DLBCL/
HGBL. Furthermore, gene expression proﬁling of TP53-mutated
tumors of patients with DLBCL identiﬁed activation of phosphoi-
nositide 3-kinase signaling,21 which could support investigation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors for patients with TP53-
mutated DLBCL/HGBL. Finally, RNA sequencing demonstrated
downregulation of interferon and apoptosis pathways as well as
CD8+ T-cell inﬁltration in DLBCL tumors with TP53 mutations as
compared with tumors without,25 and interestingly, a small number
of patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL harboring TP53 muta-
tions experienced a high overall response rate as well as increased
expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as serum interferon
gamma levels after treatment with R-CHOP plus decitabine,26
suggesting that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
may beneﬁt patients with TP53-mutated DLBCL/HGBL.
Classiﬁcation of TP53 mutations as LOF vs non-LOF is notable as
an effort to identify patients whose tumors are likely to develop as a
result of dysregulation of TP53. The presence of a high-risk genetic
alteration in a DLBCL/HGBL tumor does not necessarily equate
with abnormal protein synthesis, and it is not clear that all patients
with such an alteration in their tumors experience inferior survival if
this is
treated with standard-of-care therapy. One example of
patients diagnosed with double-hit lymphoma harboring MYC and
BCL2 rearrangements (MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma), who
are typically treated with R-EPOCH or other intensive therapies in
the ﬁrstline setting; however, patients with MYC-BCL2 double-hit
lymphoma whose tumors demonstrate non–MYC-IG rearrange-
ment have a similar prognosis to those without MYC-BCL2 double-
hit lymphoma when treated with R-CHOP.6

Additional strengths of our analysis are inclusion of patients with
HGBL tumors as well as those treated with R-EPOCH, reﬂecting
current practice in the diagnosis and treatment of aggressive B-cell
lymphomas. Furthermore, analyses of subgroups of patients with
high-risk features revealed that the presence of TP53 LOF muta-
tions may further discriminate PFS, supporting exploration of efﬁ-
cacy outcomes for patients with TP53 LOF mutations enrolled on
clinical trials investigating novel ﬁrstline treatment regimens for
high-risk DLBCL/HGBL. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of

performing CLMA, given the high success rate and relatively short
turnaround time, and it is plausible that the result of CLMA could be
factored into a decision regarding treatment modiﬁcation, such as
the addition of a small-molecule inhibitor to ﬁrstline immunoche-
motherapy at the start of cycle 2 in the experimental setting.
Ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating the beneﬁt of ven-
etoclax added to R-CHOP (NCT03984448) and acalabrutinib
added to R-CHOP (NCT04529772) for patients with newly diag-
nosed DLBCL/HGBL allow 1 cycle of R-CHOP to be administered
while conﬁrming pathologic testing before study arm assignment at
the start of cycle 2.

Weaknesses of our analysis include a smaller sample size of patients
as well as the use of more limited gene panels as compared with
some other published studies, which might have limited our ability to
identify other mutations that predict for inferior clinical outcomes in
this patient population. Additionally, although we did not analyze an
external validation cohort of patients, it is notable that patients with
TP53 LOF mutations experienced inferior estimated 2-year PFS and
OS as compared with those without TP53 LOF mutations when
analyzed as 2 separate cohorts based upon sequencing panel
performed. Finally, it is likely that some patient tumors in our series
were misclassiﬁed as “other” as per LymphGen because of our
inability to detect all mutations as well as rearrangements and copy
number changes included in this predictive algorithm.

Although it would be ideal if all clinical laboratories used identical
algorithms for characterizing TP53 LOF mutations detected in
DLBCL/HGBL tumors, this is unlikely to be the case in current
practice, as suggested by reporting of different algorithms used for
characterization of TP53 mutations in tumors from patients diag-
nosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leuke-
mia.27-29 We feel it is relevant to offer a framework for doing so,
mainly using searchable online databases in hopes that this could
contribute to development of a standardized and reproducible
reporting algorithm for classiﬁcation of TP53 mutations in DLBCL/
HGBL tumors. Additional efforts to analyze p53 expression by
immunohistochemical staining, and del17p status by FISH may
also be informative in this effort.

In conclusion, TP53 mutations as detected by CLMA predict for
inferior outcomes, most notably inferior estimated 2-year PFS on
multivariable analysis,
in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/
HGBL treated with R-CHOP or R-EPOCH. Additionally, TP53 LOF
mutations predict for inferior estimated 2-year PFS in high-risk

subsets of these patients, including those with EZB genetic clas-
siﬁcation by LymphGen. Patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL/
HGBL with tumors harboring TP53 mutation can be reliably and
rapidly identiﬁed through CLMA, which can inform prognosis for
those treated with R-CHOP/R-EPOCH as well as reveal candi-
dates for treatment on protocols investigating therapies that target
derangements caused by TP53 mutations. The use of CLMA in
other treatment settings for patients with DLBCL/HGBL should be
explored.
