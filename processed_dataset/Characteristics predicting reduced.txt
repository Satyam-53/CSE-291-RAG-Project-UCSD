Summary

Disease-causing variants with penetrance that is lower than the average expected for a given gene complicate classification, even when
using gene-specific guidelines. For TP53, a gene associated with some of the highest cancer risks, even reduced penetrance disease-pre-
disposition variants remain clinically actionable. We conducted a review of ClinVar submissions to identify TP53 variants flagged as
having reduced penetrance by genetic testing laboratories and analyzed functional, bioinformatic, immunogenicity, frequency, and
clinical features of these variants compared with standard pathogenic and benign variants. Our findings show that reported reduced
penetrance TP53 variants are more likely to exhibit intermediate functional activity in multiple assays and are predicted as deleterious
with bioinformatic tools, though with lower scores than pathogenic variants. These variants also have a higher population frequency
than pathogenic variants, and heterozygotes tend to manifest disease later in life, suggesting a need for refined clinical criteria to better
capture attenuated Li-Fraumeni syndrome phenotypes. Finally, by applying a random forest prediction model to all TP53 uncertain or
conflicting variants in ClinVar, we identified 106 additional variants with potential reduced penetrance.

Introduction

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/
Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) germ-
line variant classification guidelines are inherently dichot-
omous, distinguishing between benign and pathogenic
variants for genes associated with Mendelian diseases.1
For hereditary cancer predisposition genes associated
with high risk of cancer, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1,
PTEN, and TP53, Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Variant Cu-
ration Expert Panels (VCEPs) have helped refine these gen-
eral guidelines by incorporating gene-specific consider-
ations,2–5 such as establishing expectations based on the
standard penetrance associated with a gene of interest.

Disease-causing variants with atypical penetrance, partic-
ularly those with reduced penetrance compared with the
standard penetrance expected for that gene, pose chal-
lenges in variant classification, including when following
gene-specific VCEP guidelines. These challenges may
include incorrect assumptions about clinical presentation,
conflicting or intermediate functional results, and unusual
variant frequencies in cases and controls. As a result, these
variants are at risk of being classified as variants of uncer-
tain significance (VUS) due to conflicting evidence, or
perhaps misclassified as benign/likely benign due to the
strong weight placed on evidence types that lack sensitivity
to distinguish them as reduced penetrance, such as func-
tional data and observation in unaffected individuals.

Misclassification as benign/likely benign is particularly
concerning in clinical settings, as these variants are less
likely to be revisited or further investigated compared
with VUS simply because of resource constraints. The prob-
lem is so significant that ClinGen has set up a Low
Penetrance/Risk Allele working group to establish a stan-
dardized framework and terminology for categorizing risk
alleles and low penetrance variants in any disease gene
(https://www.clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/4531/
clingenrisk_terminology_recomendations-final-02_18_20.
pdf) and the Cancer Variant Interpretation Group-UK has
developed a classification framework for cancer risk genes
specifically.6 While these efforts mark significant progress
in the field, there is still a need for more practical evi-
dence-based guidance.

A good example for investigating variants associated
with reduced penetrance is the gene TP53 (HGNC:
11998), in which pathogenic germline variants cause Li-
Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) (MONDO:0018875), character-
ized by increased risk of various cancers, including the
LFS core cancers such as early-onset breast cancer, brain
cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, and sarcomas.7 TP53
pathogenic germline variants are known to have a very
strong association with high cancer risks at early ages,
and estimated “standard penetrance” is high; even after
strict penetrance analysis adjusting for ascertainment
bias, the lifetime cancers risks associated with TP53
variants is close to 100%.8 As a result, carriers are

recommended to initiate annual whole-body magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and brain MRI from a young
age.9,10 This expected clinical presentation, in addition
to abundant functional data,11–14 and the existence of
TP53 VCEP specifications,5 make TP53 an ideal candidate
for investigating features that can better predict variants
associated with reduced or atypical cancer penetrance.

Multigene panel testing is increasing the identification
of TP53 germline variants in patients who do not meet
the traditional clinical criteria for testing, i.e., Classic LFS
and Chompret 2015.7,15 This may reflect that the spec-
trum of LFS cancers, and/or their age at presentation, is
broader than previously recognized.16,17 However, it is
also possible that the proportion of TP53 variants exhibit-
ing reduced penetrance (compared with the average
penetrance expected from historical studies) is higher
than is currently appreciated. At this time, the only firmly
established
is
NM_000546.6(TP53):c.1010G>A (p.R337H), a Brazilian
founder variant.18 Although several other variants have
been proposed as suspected reduced penetrance based
on clinical presentation and/or functional results, their
age-specific cancer risks remain unconfirmed. Accurate
identification of
reduced penetrance TP53 variants,
accompanied by age-specific risks, is critical to ensure
appropriate patient care.19,20

The aim of this work was to assess the functional, bio-
informatic, immunogenicity, frequency, and clinical char-
acteristics of a subset of TP53 pathogenic germline variants
reported to exhibit reduced penetrance, to identify attri-
butes that can distinguish them from both TP53 patho-
genic variants with standard penetrance and from well-es-
tablished benign variants that are not clinically actionable.
We demonstrate that this approach can yield information
useful to build future variant classification models capable
of separating pathogenic variants with standard pene-
trance from those associated with reduced penetrance.

Material and methods

Definitions
In this study, we used the following terminology to categorize
variants: benign variants—unlikely to be clinically actionable
for TP53-related diseases using current specifications; reduced
penetrance pathogenic variants—disease-causing but known or
suspected to exhibit lower, moderate, or atypical penetrance
compared with standard pathogenic TP53 variants; and patho-
genic variants—assumed to have standard penetrance for TP53.

ClinVar review
To identify potential reduced penetrance TP53 variants, in addi-
tion to information available in the literature, we downloaded
ClinVar21 submissions for TP53 variants (as at March 14, 2025),
and identified evidence summaries that included the terms
“reduced,” “moderate,” or “lower penetrance/risk.” At that
time, and even at this date (May 7, 2025), there are no ClinVar
submissions for TP53 variants formally categorized as “patho-

genic, low penetrance” or “established risk allele.” Variants iden-
tified in this step formed our reduced penetrance variant group.

Statistical analyses
Distribution of functional results, predictive components, and
allele frequency for predefined variant sets
We defined reference sets of TP53 variants based on ClinVar clas-
sifications (as at April 24, 2024), based on VCEP or multiple non-
conflicting submissions, as follows: benign reference set, 62
unique missense variants classified as benign/likely benign; and
pathogenic reference set, 113 unique missense variants classified
as pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Reduced penetrance variants
were excluded from these reference sets and grouped separately
regardless of their ClinVar classification.

We then investigated the distribution of functional, bio-
informatic, immunogenicity, and frequency data for missense
variants across the three groups of variants (benign and patho-
genic reference sets, and the reduced penetrance variant group
as defined above). For functional scores, we used data from
currently available systematic assays used by the TP53 VCEP
(specifications v2.3.0), namely Kato et al.,11 Giacomelli et al.,12
Kotler et al.,13 and Funk et al.14 Score cutoffs used to assign loss
of function (LoF) or noLoF were as defined by the original studies,
and currently used by the TP53 VCEP. We also analyzed the Kato
data using published data that converted the results into four
classes with different levels of functional disruption (A–D), using
a hierarchical Ward’s clustering method.22 For bioinformatic
scores, we used predictions from BayesDel23 and aGVGD,24,25
which are currently used by the TP53 VCEP,5 and for which we
applied the VCEP-defined cutoffs for predicting deleteriousness
(where relevant), as well as
the more recent predictor
AlphaMissense,26 using the cutoffs defined in the original study.
Immunogenicity scores (immune fitness) were analyzed sepa-
rately, for which we used predictions derived from a mathemat-
ical framework that quantifies a variant’s susceptibility to the im-
mune system, which is proportional to its probability of being
presented on HLA-I.27 Although these scores are not currently
used in TP53 variant classification, they provide an independent
type of evidence not currently considered in existing guidelines
and are available for all missense variants. Additionally, we inves-
tigated the distribution of the total allele frequency across all ge-
netic ancestry groups for all variants using gnomAD v4.1.28 Sensi-
tivity analyses were performed to investigate the distribution of
all scores above, after excluding variants flagged as reduced pene-
trance by only a single diagnostic laboratory.

We conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise com-
parisons using Wilcoxon tests, and chi-square tests to analyze sta-
tistical differences between all variant groups in RStudio (R
version 4.4.1).
Personal cancer history analysis of clinical presentation for
pathogenic vs. reduced penetrance variants
We used previously established methods29 to conduct personal
history analyses using binary logistic regression in SPSS (version
23). Proband data were derived from multigene panel testing he-
reditary cancer results between 2011 and 2020 from Ambry Ge-
netics, as previously used.30 This project was approved by the
QIMR Berghofer Human Research Ethics Committee (Project
1051). After excluding individuals identified to have a TP53
variant with variant allele fraction ≤35% (to remove potential
mosaic or somatic cases), the Ambry dataset included 256,868 pro-
bands negative for pathogenic/likely pathogenic or uncertain

by Ambry Genetics), 203 probands with TP53 reduced penetrance
variants (as described above), and 505 probands with TP53 patho-
genic/likely pathogenic variants (as classified by Ambry Genetics,
excluding those falling in the reduced penetrance group)
(Figure S1). Of the 189 unique variants observed in the pathogenic
group, 59 overlapped with the ClinVar pathogenic reference set.
For this study we conducted two independent analyses,
comparing clinical presentation in the baseline group of individ-
uals without a known TP53 pathogenic variant to (1) features of
individuals with a pathogenic variant and (2) features of individ-
uals with a reduced penetrance variant.

The phenotypic predictors included in the analysis were the

follows: breast cancer <31 years, breast cancer 31–35 years, breast
cancer 36–60 years, brain tumor ≤45 years, brain tumor 46–60
years, sarcoma ≤45 years, sarcoma 46–60 years, and adrenocor-
tical carcinoma ≤60 years.

affected, and their age at first cancer diagnosis, among the three
groups were analyzed with chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests,
respectively.
Random forest predictive model
We built a random forest classification model to categorize the
missense variant class (pathogenic, benign, or reduced pene-
trance) based on scores from the four different functional assays
(Kato, Giacomelli, Kotler, Funk), and the four computational pre-
dictors (BayesDel, AlphaMissense, aGVGD,
Immune fitness)
analyzed in this study, as well as the total allele frequency. The
model was trained using data from the ClinVar reference set var-
iants as well as the reduced penetrance group (excluding c.1101-
1G>A), where the missing values in the Kotler and Funk scores
were imputed by replacing them with the median value within
each variant class. A random seed of 123 was set to ensure repro-
ducibility. We used 500 trees in the random forest, and model
performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix. The feature
importance of each score was also assessed to understand which
variables contributed most to the model predictions, using
Mean Decrease in Gini values.

We applied this model to the remaining variants in ClinVar (as
at March 14, 2025) in order to identify new potential reduced
penetrance TP53 variants based on their unique functional, pre-

dictive, and allele frequency characteristics. After excluding vari-
ants for which both Kotler and Funk scores were missing, the
ClinVar classifications for these variants were as follows: 12
benign/likely benign, 26 pathogenic/likely pathogenic missense
variants in ClinVar classified by single submitters only (and there-
fore not included in the original ClinVar reference sets), and 590
TP53 missense variants classified as uncertain significance or with
conflicting classifications in ClinVar.

Results

Suspected reduced penetrance variants
In addition to the known Brazilian founder variant
NM_000546.6(TP53):c.1010G>A (p.R337H),18 we identi-
fied 10 more variants (nine missense, one splice site) listed
in ClinVar meeting our search criteria for designation as
(suspected) reduced penetrance (Table 1). An additional
variant, NM_000546.6(TP53):c.467G>A (p.R156H), was
included due to being flagged as suspected reduced pene-
trance by Couch et al.31 and Behoray et al.32 Only four of
the 11 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely patho-
genic in ClinVar, one of these being the Brazilian founder

(p.T256A), c.845G>A (p.R282Q), c.848G>A (p.R283H),
and c.1101-1G>A) had only been flagged as reduced pene-
trance by Ambry Genetics, and therefore excluded as part
of the sensitivity analyses.

both of these assays being restricted to specific exons. The
vast majority (>85%) of variants in the benign or patho-
genic reference sets exhibited functional impact corre-
sponding to noLoF or LoF, respectively (Table 2). Of the
four functional assays, only Kato defined a score range
indicating intermediate function; seven out of 10 (70%)
reduced penetrance missense variants fell within this
range, with LoF category assigned to two of the three re-
maining variants in this group. For the remaining assays,
LoF was assigned for one (Giacomelli), two (Kotler), and
six (Funk) of the reduced penetrance variants.

Differences in the distribution of functional assay scores
across all three variant groups were highly significant
(p < 0.001) (Table 2). Overall, the median distribution of
functional assay scores for the reduced penetrance vari-
ants fell between that of benign and pathogenic variants
(Figure 1). The distribution of Kato and Giacomelli scores
differed highly significantly between pairwise compari-
sons of the variant groups (p < 0.001). Regarding the Kotler
scores, significant differences were observed between the
benign vs. pathogenic and reduced penetrance vs. patho-
genic groups (p < 0.001), but no significant difference was
found between the benign vs. reduced penetrance groups
(p > 0.05). For the Funk assay, differences in scores were
highly significant comparing benign vs. pathogenic or
reduced penetrance (p < 0.001), with somewhat smaller
differences between the reduced penetrance vs. patho-
genic group (p < 0.01).

Significant differences in the distribution of the Kato
clustering classes were observed across the three variant
groups (p = 1.41 × 10(cid:0) 35). The benign group was predom-
inantly represented by class D (42 of 62, 68%), the reduced
penetrance group by class C (7 of 10, 70%), and the path-
ogenic group by class A (93 of 113, 82%) (Figure 2).

Predictive components
Bioinformatic analysis of missense variants
Bioinformatic predictions were available for all 185
missense variants in all three variant groups. Both the
BayesDel and AlphaMissense tools performed well in

predicting deleteriousness for benign and pathogenic
variants, with median scores typically below or above
the selected cutoffs, respectively (Table 3). All variants
in the reduced penetrance and pathogenic groups were
predicted as deleterious by BayesDel, while 54 of the
62 (87%) benign variants were predicted neutral. For
AlphaMissense, which includes an ambiguous category,
five out of 62 (8%) benign variants, seven out of 10
(70%) reduced penetrance variants, and 110 out of 113
(97%) pathogenic variants were predicted deleterious.
Two variants in each group were predicted to have an
in both the
intermediate effect. Only one variant
reduced penetrance and pathogenic groups was pre-
dicted as neutral, compared with 55 (89%) in the benign
group.

Differences in the distribution of bioinformatic results
were highly significant across all three variant groups
(p < 0.001) (Table 3). Similar to observations for the
functional assays, the median distribution of BayesDel
and AlphaMissense scores for reduced penetrance vari-
ants appeared to be positioned between that of benign
and pathogenic variants (Figure 3). For both tools, pair-
wise comparisons showed that the differences between
reduced penetrance and pathogenic variants were not
as marked (p < 0.05 for BayesDel and p < 0.01 for
AlphaMissense) as
the remaining comparisons
(p < 0.001).

(p = 5.31 × 10(cid:0) 22). The benign group was predominantly
represented by class C0 (54 of 62, 87%), the pathogenic
group by class C65 (65 of 113, 57%), while the reduced
penetrance group had a higher diversity of categories
(Figure 4). In particular, three reduced penetrance variants
were C0 (predicted neutral) and three were C65 (predicted
most deleterious), while the other four fell into categories
between.
Immunogenicity analysis of missense variants
Immune fitness predictions were available for all 185
missense variants across the three variant groups. While

there are no published cutoffs to define different levels of
immune fitness, the distribution scores differed signifi-
cantly across all three variant groups (p = 9.40 × 10(cid:0) 21).
Benign variants had the highest immune fitness (median
(cid:0) 0.41), followed by reduced penetrance variants (median
(cid:0) 0.55) and pathogenic variants (median (cid:0) 0.68). Pairwise
comparisons showed that the differences between the
reduced penetrance and pathogenic variants were some-
what less pronounced (p < 0.01) than the differences
observed in comparisons
involving benign variants
(Figure 5).

Differences in allele frequency across groups
The distribution of allele frequency differed significantly
across all three variant groups (p = 3.48 × 10(cid:0) 20)
(Table 4). All 113 pathogenic variants met PM2_
Supporting (as defined by the TP53 VCEP specifications
v2.3.0), as opposed to nine of 11 (82%) reduced pene-
trance variants and 40 of 62 (64%) benign variants. Of
note, six of the variants in the benign group met BS1 based
on the filtering allele frequency (as defined by the TP53
VCEP specifications v2.3.0), as opposed to none in the
reduced penetrance groups. As expected, benign variants

exhibited the highest allele frequency, pathogenic vari-
ants the lowest, and reduced penetrance variants fell in-
between (Figure 6). The differences between benign and
pathogenic variants, as well as between reduced pene-
trance and pathogenic variants, were both highly signifi-
cant (p < 0.001); however, the allele frequency distribution
between benign and reduced penetrance variants did not
differ significantly (p > 0.05).

Sensitivity analyses
After excluding variants with only ClinVar submissions
from Ambry Genetics suggesting reduced penetrance
(five missense and one splice site), the differences in the
distributions of scores remained similar; the reduced
penetrance variants continued to have scores distributed
in the middle between benign and pathogenic variants
(Figures S2–S7). Three-way distribution comparisons for
all functional, predictive, and allele frequency compo-
nents remained significantly different (p < 0.01), although
overall differences in the pairwise comparisons against
reduced penetrance variants became less pronounced, as
expected given the smaller sample set for reduced pene-
trance variants.

trance group lacked enough data for sarcoma 46–60 years
and adrenocortical carcinoma ≤60 years.

Identification of additional potential reduced
penetrance TP53 missense variants
The random forest model was trained to categorize vari-
ants into three classes (pathogenic, benign, and reduced
penetrance), based on nine components (Kato, Giaco-
melli, Kotler, Funk, BayesDel, AlphaMissense, aGVGD,
immune fitness, and total allele frequency). The model
performed well in predicting benign (1.6% classification
error) and pathogenic variants (0.9% classification error)
but showed a higher error rate for reduced penetrance var-
iants (30%), as shown by the confusion matrix (Table S2).
The feature importance analysis of the random forest
model revealed that the Kato score was the most influen-
tial feature in categorizing variants into the three groups,
with the highest Mean Decrease in Gini value of 22.2,
closely followed by Funk (20.8) (Figure S8). Other influen-
tial features were Giacomelli (18.3) and Kotler (16.0).
Allele frequency and Immune fitness had the lowest
importance in this model, with a Mean Decrease in Gini
value of 1.1.

When this model was applied to additional variants in
ClinVar (that is, variants not in any of the reference
groups), the model categorization agreed with classifica-
tions for all 12 benign/likely benign variants and all 36
in
pathogenic/likely pathogenic
ClinVar. Of the remaining 590 uncertain significance or
conflicting TP53 missense variants to which this model
was applied, 106 were categorized as reduced penetrance,
of which 85 were uncertain and 21 conflicting in ClinVar
(Table S3). In the Ambry Genetics dataset, 121 individuals
carried one of these variants. The average age at first can-
cer diagnosis was 44.8 years, and 45% were affected by any
cancer; proportions that were not significantly different
from those observed in the original reduced penetrance
variant group (p > 0.05).

Discussion

For most cancer genes, current variant classification
models are not designed to classify reduced penetrance
variants. For genes like TP53, where pathogenic variants
are linked to an extremely high cancer risk8 and have asso-
ciated intensive surveillance strategies,33 even variants
with a lower-than-average penetrance warrant clinical ac-
tion. Further, for variants that are already classified as
pathogenic, it is important to confirm which of these
have reduced penetrance, as this could lead to different
clinical management strategies for carriers, as it is the
case for R337H carriers.20

Our study enhances understanding of the functional,
bioinformatic, immunogenicity, frequency, and clinical
characteristics of reported reduced penetrance cancer
and
gene variants, using TP53 as

an example,

ity, from lowest (A) to highest (D) as per Montellier et al.22

Phenotypic predictors associated with reduced
penetrance variants
The Ambry dataset used for the personal history analysis
had proband data for carriers of all reduced penetrance
variants included in this study. The variants with the
highest number of probands were c.542G>A (p.R181H)
and c.467G>A (p.R156H), with 46 probands each, while
c.405C>G (p.C135W) and c.1101-1G>A had only one pro-
band each. The number of individuals with the remaining
reduced penetrance variants ranged from two to 28. For
this analysis, the control group included individuals
without a known pathogenic/likely pathogenic or uncer-
tain variant.

The proportion of individuals affected with any cancer
for the control, reduced penetrance, and pathogenic
groups was 40%, 43%, and 48%, respectively (p < 0.001),
with average age at first cancer diagnosis being 50.3 years,
47.7 years, and 36.6 years, respectively (p < 0.001).

In the phenotypic prediction analysis, odds ratios (ORs)
represent enrichment of the phenotype within the cohort
of tested individuals, and not cancer risk relative to base-
line population risk. The ORs indicated significant enrich-
ment of the following phenotypes in the pathogenic
variant group relative to individuals without a pathogenic
variant in this cohort (Table 5): breast cancer <31 years,
breast cancer 31–35 years, brain tumor ≤45 years, sarcoma
≤45 years, sarcoma 46–60 years, and adrenocortical carci-
noma ≤60 years. In the reduced penetrance group, only
breast cancer <31 years and sarcoma ≤45 years showed sig-
nificant enrichment compared with individuals without a
pathogenic variant, but with much lower ORs compared
with the pathogenic variant group (OR 3.05 vs. 16.07 for
breast cancer <31 years, significantly different based on
the confidence intervals; OR 7.09 vs. 27.85 for sarcoma
≤45 years, not significantly different). The reduced pene-

demonstrates how these features can be used to provide a
foundation for prediction models to better identify
reduced penetrance disease-causing variants as being
distinct from benign or standard penetrance pathogenic
variants. Importantly, based on the distribution of these
features, we developed a preliminary predictive model
that identified 106 potential reduced penetrance TP53
variants, currently in ClinVar as VUS or conflicting. These
variants are provided in Table S3 as candidates for future
TP53-specific analyses aimed at confirming their reduced
penetrance,
including formal penetrance studies and
modeling approaches designed to assess their clinical
impact. While we highlight the preliminary nature of
this predictive model, based on a small reference set of re-
ported (suspected) reduced penetrance variants, we note
that the model correctly identified all variants with single
submission assertions as benign/likely benign or patho-
genic/likely pathogenic.

From examination of the different data types, we high-
light several interesting observations that collectively sug-
gest that existing ClinGen VCEP approaches could be
extended to better identify reduced penetrance variants,
by incorporating more precise functional ranges, recali-
brated bioinformatic tools, and descriptions of attenuated
LFS phenotypes that can better distinguish between
reduced and standard penetrance variants.

First, reduced penetrance variants were more likely to
exhibit intermediate functional activity, as demonstrated
by four independent functional studies.11–14 Among exist-
ing assays, only Kato explicitly includes a “partial func-
tion” category, where most reduced penetrance variants
clustered in this study. While this could have served as a
potential reason for them being flagged as potential
reduced penetrance by the ClinVar submitters, similar dis-
tributions were also observed for the other functional as-
the Kato clustering classes,22 offering
says. Notably,
greater granularity than the original three Kato categories,
could be leveraged for improved specificity, in line with a
recent cancer risk study that found that carriers of cluster
B or C variants were less likely to meet clinical testing
criteria for LFS.34 Interestingly, in our random effects

model all four functional assays had the highest influence
to predict reduced penetrance, in comparison with predic-
tive components and allele frequency. Ideally, new func-
tional assays should be developed to better capture inter-
mediate functions or alternative disease mechanisms,
but our findings suggest that existing assays could be reca-
librated for finer granularity to identify suspected reduced
penetrance TP53 variants. Further, current assays differ
slightly in how they analyze functional impact, and our
study revealed distinct differences in the distribution of
results across the three variant groups, indicating that
integrating multiple assays into a combined model may
be more informative than relying on a single assay, as
has been suggested in the context of multiplexed assays
of variant effect.35

Second, reduced penetrance variants tended to be pre-
dicted as deleterious by multiple bioinformatics tools,
although with lower scores than pathogenic variants on
average. In addition, aGVGD24,25 displayed a greater diver-
sity of results for reduced penetrance variants compared
with the other groups. Although AlphaMissense26
currently includes a score range for intermediate function,
most reduced penetrance variants were predicted delete-
rious following the cutoffs recommended in the original
publication, suggesting that recalibration of this tool to
introduce more categories could enhance its value to sepa-
rate reduced penetrance from standard penetrance patho-
genic variants. Similarly, recalibration to define additional
categories for BayesDel23 could also improve its utility for
identifying variants with reduced penetrance. Analysis of
the predicted immune fitness also showed that reduced
penetrance variants have an intermediate fitness, with
lower immune susceptibility than pathogenic variants, in
agreement with a potential lower oncogenic potential.27

Third, the total allele frequency distribution of reduced
penetrance variants more closely resembled that of benign
variants than pathogenic variants. However, most still
met the PM2_Supporting criterion, suggesting that their
somewhat higher frequency would not impact the appli-
cation of pathogenic clinical codes (i.e., PS4) that require
PM2_Supporting to be met in order to be considered.

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. Statistical comparisons noted in the center are for benign vs. pathogenic variants.

Last, as we would expect, in comparison to standard
pathogenic variants, for reduced penetrance variants we
observed later average age at first cancer diagnosis, and
the core LFS cancers currently used as clinical evidence
of pathogenicity were not as highly associated. However,
it is notable that the most characteristic TP53-associated
cancers, particularly early-onset breast cancer and sar-
comas, remained significantly associated with reduced
penetrance variants, although with lower level of enrich-
ment than for the group with standard pathogenic vari-
ants. While these results do not suggest that the identified
significant phenotypes can serve as predictors of reduced
penetrance variants, they do provide a way to analyze po-
tential differences relative to standard high-penetrance

pathogenic variants. This all suggests that more attenu-
ated LFS phenotypes should be considered for application
of clinical evidence in favor of pathogenicity to facilitate
identification of TP53 reduced penetrance variants.16

We recognize the potential for circularity in our study.
Our reference sets of pathogenic and benign variants
were derived from ClinVar, where some of the predictive
components analyzed in this study would have contrib-
uted to their classifications. However, no single compo-
nent alone would have been decisive in classifications
made by expert panels or through multiple non-conflict-
ing submissions, as these typically rely on a combination
of evidence types. Additionally, we incorporated newer
functional assays14 and bioinformatic tools26 that were

reference sets were established,
published after our
ensuring that these classifications were not directly influ-
enced by these newer methodologies. In addition, as pre-
viously noted, some components used in this study, such
as Kato results, may have contributed to flagging certain
variants as potentially reduced penetrance. However, the
similar distribution observed across other functional
studies suggests that this is not solely driven by the Kato
results. Suspicions of reduced penetrance are typically
supported by internal clinical data from laboratories,
rather than relying on functional results alone, as indi-
cated by the evidence summaries in ClinVar (Table S1).
Additionally, the fact that our model predictions aligned
correctly with all single pathogenic and benign submis-
sions in ClinVar is not unexpected, given that compo-
nents of the model likely influenced the original classifica-
tion of these variants. Nevertheless, this performance
demonstrates the model’s ability to align with these clas-

sifications and to prioritize other potential reduced pene-
trance variants for research purposes.

Another substantial limitation is the small sample size
for the reduced penetrance group, particularly given that
most of these variants are suspected, with only one being
officially confirmed.18 It is possible that some of these var-
iants may not truly exhibit reduced penetrance. It is also
conceivable that some variants included in the pathogenic
and benign reference sets could be associated with reduced
penetrance. In the end, both the low number of reduced
penetrance variants and uncertainty in the reference panels
reflect the difficulty of identifying these variants with cer-
tainty, an issue that our model aims to begin to address.

Future larger studies with a greater number of variants
will be essential to validate and confirm our findings.
We acknowledge the substantial phenotypic variability
within LFS, which adds to the complexity of interpreting
clinical
implications for reduced penetrance variants.
This heterogeneity highlights the need for caution before
drawing clinical conclusions from current data. However,
the occurrence of early-onset cancers among TP53
reduced penetrance variant carriers suggests that, in the
future, variant-level differences may inform more tailored
risk assessment and management strategies. Additional
larger studies will also play a key role in quantifying age-
specific risks for reduced penetrance variants highlighted
in this study, aiming to improve the clinical management
of carriers and enhance the accuracy of cancer risk predic-
tion for affected individuals and their relatives.
