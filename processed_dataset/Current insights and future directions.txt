Discover Oncology Review Current insights and future directions of Li‑Fraumeni syndrome Mohammad‑Salar Hosseini1,2,3 Received: 20 August 2024 / Accepted: 7 October 2024 © The Author(s) 2024 OPEN Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare yet serious hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, marked by a significant earlylife increased risk of developing cancer. Primarily caused by germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, Li-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with a wide range of malignancies. Clinical management of Li-Fraumeni syndrome could be challenging, especially the lifelong surveillance and follow-up of patients which requires a multidisciplinary approach. Emerging insights into the molecular and clinical basis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, coupled with advances in genomic technologies and targeted therapies, offer promise in optimizing risk assessment, early detection, and treatment strategies tailored to the unique clinical and molecular profiles of affected individuals. This review discusses Li-Fraumeni syndrome in more depth, reviewing molecular, genomic, epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of this disease.

First described over fifty years ago, the initial suspicion was raised by Frederick P. Li and Joseph F. Fraumeni as an “increased familial susceptibility to cancer” was observed “not only by the large number of members affected but by a seeming excess of multiple primary neoplasms”, suggesting a potentially familial origin of the observed malignancies [2, 3]. The diagnosis of LFS is challenging due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation and diagnostic controversies [4, 5]. Moreover, the surveillance of LFS patients poses a further challenge to clinicians, as the individuals commonly face recurrent states of malignancies, either due to genetic predisposition or complications of previous cancer treatments [6, 7]. This review aims to provide comprehensive basic and clinical insight into LSF, discussing this syndrome’s genomic, epidemiological, and clinical aspects. * Mohammad-Salar Hosseini, hosseini.msalar@gmail.com; hosseinim@tbzmed.ac.ir | 1Research Center for Integrative Medicine in Aging, Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Golgasht Street, Tabriz 51666, EA, Iran. 2Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 3Research Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Iranian EBM Center: A JBI Center of Excellence, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Vol.:(0123456789) Review Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | 2 Main text 2.1 Molecular and genomic basis LFS is primarily associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene, located on chromosome 17p13 [8, 9]. TP53 encodes the p53 protein, a critical tumor suppressor involved in regulating cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence, with its alterations widely contribute to cancer development [10, 11]. The loss of the tumor suppressor function results in impaired cell cycle regulation, uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased genomic instability, and ultimately, predisposes the affected individuals to cancer development [12–14]. Therefore, TP53 holds fundamental regulatory roles in maintaining cellular responses to stressors, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, thereby safeguarding genomic integrity [15, 16]. Figure 1 demonstrates the impact of TP53 mutation in terms of genomic and cellular pathways. The spectrum of TP53 mutations linked to LFS includes various molecular abnormalities, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, in-frame mutations, splice site mutations, and nonsense mutations [17, 18]. As the most common mutations in this case, missense mutations result in the amino acid sequence alterations in the p53 protein, compromising its structural integrity and functional competence (Fig. 2). Nonsense mutations cause the p53 protein to prematurely truncate, eliminating its tumor suppressor properties and precipitating the onset of an aggressive neoplastic phenotype. Comparably, frameshift mutations disrupt the reading frame of TP53, resulting in aberrant protein translation and functional incapacitation, while splice site mutations interrupt the fidelity of RNA splicing, thereby engendering diverse phenotypic outcomes, depending on the resulting transcript variants [19, 20]. The nucleotide mutation patterns are dominantly C-to-T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, prone to methylation and subsequent deamination, making them hotspots for mutations . Other substitutions, such as G-to-A or A-to-G transitions, occur less frequently and tend to have varying impacts on p53’s function . Figures 2 and 3 exhibit the distribution of TP53 mutation variants and mutation effects, highlighting the non-random nature of TP53 mutations, with a marked preference for specific types of transitions and transversions. Although mutations have been detected in almost every codon, the majority of pathogenic TP53 mutations occur within exons 5 to 8 in the DNA-binding domain (around codons 100 to 300), which is crucial for the protein’s ability to mediate tumor suppression [21, 23, 24]. Mutations in the transactivation domain are less common but can disrupt the Fig. 1 The impact of TP53 mutation in cellular mechanisms and pathways Vol:.(1234567890) Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Review Fig. 2 Distribution of TP53 mutation effect (N = 28,866 – data from TP53 Database, R20) Fig. 3 TP53 mutation variant distribution based on the mutation patterns (N = 28,866 – data from TP53 Database, R20) pro-apoptotic abilities of p53 [25, 26]. Mutations can also occur in the oligomerization domain (exons 9 and 10), often impairing the structural integrity and stability [17, 27]. Codons 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 are among the most common hotspot mutations [21, 23]. Additionally, specific founder variants of TP53 have also been observed in particular populations, such as R337H and P47S, which are more prevalent among Brazilians and individuals of African descent, respectively, both affecting non-DNA-binding domains [28, 29]. R337H mutation has contributed to a high incidence of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), but is notable for its incomplete penetrance . Moreover, Some missense mutations in TP53 have a dominant-negative effect, meaning the mutant p53 protein not only loses its tumor-suppressive function but also interferes with the function of the remaining wild-type p53, exacerbating the cancer risk . Hotspot mutations such as R175H, R248Q, and R273H are examples of dominant-negative mutations [32, 33]. Considering the higher prevalence of hotspot mutations, the profound impact of dominant-negative mutations, and the co-prevalence of founder variations with specific cancer types, recent studies and secondary analyses have focused on potential genotype–phenotype correlations [34, 35]. Although the hotspot variations show a likely shift toward early-onset (before 31) breast cancer and sarcoma, current evidence is inconclusive for any significant correlations . There is still significant variability in how TP53 mutations manifest clinically. Even within families, individuals with the same TP53 mutation can present with different malignancies, different onset ages, and varying treatment responses . 2.2 Epidemiology Studies have shown that LFS is a rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 20,000 individuals in the general population . Geographically, LFS exhibits global distribution Vol.:(0123456789) Review Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | without remarkable ethnic or racial preferences, although certain populations may exhibit founder mutations or higher prevalence rates attributable to genetic drift, population bottlenecks, or consanguinity [39, 40]. Despite its rarity, LFS exhibits considerable variability in penetrance and expressivity, with inter-individual variability in tumor spectrum, age of onset, and disease trajectory, attributable to modifier genes, environmental influences, and stochastic and random events [41–44]. The general viewpoint on LFS suggests a high penetrance of this familial syndrome, with about 80% risk of cancer during the individual’s lifespan [45, 46]. Studies estimate that over 350,000 individuals have germline TP53 mutations—substantially more than registered cases—suggesting either a potential underdiagnosis of LFS cases worldwide or variation in its estimated penetrance [47, 48]. Also, there have been several reports of individuals with rare early-onset malignancies and TP53 mutations who have had a negative familial history of cancer, suggesting a potentially higher prevalence of LFS than estimated [49–52]. Tables 1 and 2 present the tumor site distribution of TP53 germline mutations in confirmed carriers and mutations identified in human tumor samples, retrieved from the R20 release of TP53 database [53, 54]. As presented, breasts, soft tissues, brain, adrenal glands, and bones are the most common tumor sites in individuals with TP53 germline mutations. Around half of the TP53 mutation carriers are expected to develop cancer before the age of 30 [55, 56]. Notably, the prevalence of LFS may be underestimated due to challenges in clinical detection, diagnostic ascertainment, and genetic testing accessibility [57, 58]. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and expanding indications for genetic testing in oncology practice have facilitated the identification of novel germline TP53 mutations and expanded the clinical spectrum of LFS-associated malignancies beyond the classic triad of sarcomas, breast cancer, and brain tumors [59, 60]. 2.3 Clinical features LFS is characterized by a diverse spectrum of malignancies affecting multiple organ systems. Common tumors associated with LFS include soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors (such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma), adrenocortical carcinoma, and leukemia, particularly, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [61, 62]. The age of onset for cancer in LFS is typically younger compared to the sporadic cases, with many tumors diagnosed during childhood or early adulthood . Additionally, individuals with LFS are at increased risk of developing multiple primary cancers over their lifetime, further complicating management and surveillance strategies .

Sarcomas contribute to one-fourth of all tumors in LFS patients, with the majority of cases exhibiting before 50 years old . The mesenchymal tumors arise from connective tissues, including but not limited to bones, cartilage, muscle, adipose tissue, and blood vessels, in different locations such as extremities, retroperitoneum, and head and neck regions, resulting in malignancies such as osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , chondrosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , liposarcoma , angiosarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) , and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) . Sarcomas generally vary in histologic subtypes, and could be accompanied by diverse clinical presentations and therapeutic responses. LFS-related sarcomas usually develop in childhood or early adulthood, often preceding the diagnosis of other LFS-associated malignancies. The clinical presentations of sarcomas in LFS are characterized by their heterogeneity and tendency for metastasis and dissemination through the body ; therefore, any clinical suspicion is typically followed by comprehensive imaging studies and histopathological evaluations . Rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma are among the most common sarcoma subtypes encountered in LFS . 2.3.2 Breast cancer In addition to sarcomas, LFS patients are at a significantly greater risk of breast cancer. In fact, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in female patients with LFS . Previous studies have indicated that women with LFS experience breast cancer almost three decades earlier than the general population, usually with a mean onset age of around 32–38 [76–79]. Studies have suggested the potential impact of reproductive factors since significant protective effects of breastfeeding for over seven months have been observed in respective populations . Breast cancer in the context of LFS often exhibits aggressive histopathological features, including high histologic grade and overexpression of HER2/neu oncogene, tending towards an inferior overall survival compared to sporadic cases [77, 81]. Many LFS cases of breast cancer are estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, suggesting the potential association of early-onset HER2-positive breast cancer with the presence of TP53 mutations . Vol.:(0123456789) Review Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Clinical presentations of breast cancer are diverse and could be the earliest presenting signs and symptoms of LFS. Notably, breast cancers in LFS frequently emerge at a younger age compared to sporadic cases, making early breast cancer an alarming sign for clinicians to initiate an in-depth workup for LFS [56, 76, 83]. 2.3.3 Brain tumors Central nervous system (CNS) tumors could range from high-grade gliomas, namely glioblastoma multiforme, to embryonal tumors, such as medulloblastoma, with variable histologic subtypes and clinical behaviors [84, 85]. These CNS tumors may present with neurological symptoms, including headaches, seizures, focal deficits, and merely cognitive impairments, prompting diagnostic evaluation with further neuroimaging modalities . Glioma, including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma, along with medulloblastoma and choroid plexus carcinoma, are the most common subtypes of brain cancer associated with LFS [85, 87–89]. Glioma exhibits infiltrative growth patterns and aggressive histologic features, commonly with therapeutic resistance [90, 91]. Medulloblastoma is another LFS-associated brain tumor arising from the cerebellum, characterized by the propensity for metastatic dissemination via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . 2.3.4 Adrenocortical carcinoma On the other hand, ACC could present with nonspecific or constitutional symptoms such as abdominal pain. Although ACC cases are generally sporadic, further evaluation for genetic predispositions such as LFS or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome is recommended upon diagnosis . Arising from the adrenal cortex, ACC usually presents with an aggressive clinical course, propensity for metastatic spread, and poor prognosis . The clinical presentations of ACC in LFS are variable and nonspecific, often mimicking symptoms of other adrenal disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome, or constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal fullness . Notably, ACC may also be accidentally detected in imaging studies performed for unrelated indications, or during treatment for other diagnoses . 2.3.5 Hematologic malignancies Hematologic malignancies might not be the initial denoting manifestation of LFS, but, in the case, they could present with unspecific or constitutional symptoms, along with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or blood count abnormalities in further clinical evaluation and workup . Although LFS accounts for less than 1% of ALL cases—the most frequently reported LFS-linked leukemia—in children, it comes with a significant predisposition to adverse treatment outcomes and second cancers [97, 98]. Furthermore, studies have reported an estimated six times higher risk of developing leukemia in the LFS population . Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphomas are also linked to LFS, but present with lower incidence . TP53 mutation and LFS are linked to 10–15% and 5% of AML cases, respectively . As a consequence of dysregulated proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursors, culminating in the emergence of abnormal hematopoietic clones with malignant potential, hematologic malignancies often display aggressive clinical behaviors in LFS patients, with resistance to conventional therapies, relapse, and propensity for recurrence [102–105]. 2.3.6 Other presentations Not all cases of LFS typically present with the discussed presentations, as many LFS cases have been reported with other malignancies. For instance, some studies have indicated melanoma as a potentially LFS-related malignancy; however, the association between LFS and melanoma is currently indefinite [106–108]. Figure 4 displays the most common tumor sites and clinical presentations of LFS. Vol:.(1234567890) Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Review Fig. 4 The most common malignancies of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, along with their most common clinical presentations 2.4 Diagnosis The diagnosis of LFS should be based on a combined clinical and genetic approach. Nonetheless, the definite diagnosis of LFS relies on TP53 mutation. However, several diagnostic criteria have been introduced to help clinicians effectively diagnose LFS and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFLS) cases, including the classic criteria, Chompret and its updated criteria, the Birch criteria, and the Eeles criteria [110–113]. Table 3 summarizes the proposed criteria for both LFS and LFLS. The classic criteria for LFS include: 1. Diagnosis of sarcoma before age 45 in an individual 2. A relative (first-degree) with any cancer before age 45 3. Another relative (first-/second-degree) with any cancer before age 45, or a sarcoma at any age Individuals meeting the clinical criteria are referred to genetic testing for TP53 mutations. In addition to genetic testing, comprehensive familial pedigree analysis plays a vital role in clarifying the hereditary basis of cancer predisposition syndromes, including LFS. Patients with other combinations for personal or familial history of malignancies could still be considered clinically high-risk for LFS and managed accordingly. Importantly, in cases of high clinical suspicion, a negative result for the detectable pathogenic variants does not exclude the LFS diagnosis . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends testing for individuals complying with CRIT-7 (testing criteria for LFS), including individuals fulfilling classic LFS or Chompret criteria, individuals with personal/familial history of pediatric hypodiploid ALL, and people with cancer with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) TP53 variant identified on tumor-only genomic testing, with germline evaluation considered in patients with an age of cancer diagnosis before 30 years old, or per clinician discretion . However, in case the criteria are unmet, testing for other hereditary syndromes should be considered. Vol.:(0123456789) Review Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Table 3 Diagnostic criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, requiring further screening for germline TP53 mutation Disease Diagnostic criteria Description Li-Fraumeni syndrome Classic criteria Chompret criteria (updated) Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome Birch criteria Eeles criteria 2.5 Management, surveillance, and screening Presence of all the following: Sarcoma diagnosed at age < 45 years; First-degree relative < 45 with any cancer; First/second-degree relative with sarcoma at any age or any cancer < 45 years The presence of one of the following: Tumor from the Li-Fraumeni spectrum (sarcoma, breast cancer, central nervous system tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, leukemia, or lung cancer) < 46, and at least one first/second-degree relative with Li-Fraumeni tumor (except breast cancer if the proband has breast cancer) < 56 or with multiple tumors; Multiple tumors (except multiple breast tumors), two of which belong to the Li-Fraumeni spectrum, with the first one occurring < 46; Diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma, choroid plexus tumor, or rhabdomyosarcoma of embryonal anaplastic subtype, irrespective of age and family history Breast cancer < 31 Presence of all the following: Any childhood cancer, or sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenocortical carcinoma diagnosed < 45; First/second-degree relative with a Li-Fraumeni spectrum cancer (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, or leukemia) at any age; First/second-degree relative with any cancer < 60 Two first/second-degree relatives with Li-Fraumeni spectrum tumor at any age Considering the high risk of developing cancer at a young age, individuals with LFS require lifelong surveillance and screening to detect tumors at an early, potentially curable stage. The preferred screening modalities and intervals should be based on the treating physicians’ discretion. Although there are controversies among current surveillance protocols, some routine screenings are recommended in most guidelines, including [109, 114, 116, 117]: – Triannual (until 18) or biannual/annual (after 18) clinical examination – Annual whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – Bi/triannual abdominopelvic ultrasound – Annual breast MRI and mammography for women starting at age 20 – Routine blood and urinary workup, including a complete blood count with differentials, along with blood inflammatory markers and available cancer biomarkers–a peripheral blood smear could also be helpful – Annual brain MRI – Colonoscopy every 2–5 years, beginning from age 18–25 Table 4 compares LFS surveillance protocols from the latest guidelines and consensuses in more detail [109, 114–118]. Recent studies have also proposed novel cell-free DNA (cfDNA) approaches toward early cancer detection in LFS patients . Routine clinical examination is necessary for LFS patients . Starting from basic vital signs, clinicians should look after any indicating symptoms and signs, including pallor, unexplained weight loss, Cushing’s-like facial features, night sweet, persistent or progressive pain, sense of lump, bulge, or swelling, headache, seizure, visual disturbance in any form, hemoptysis, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any skin changes. The management of LFS requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving genetic counseling, cancer surveillance, risk reduction strategies, and personalized treatment interventions. Lifestyle modifications should be made to reduce cancer risk, including smoking cessation and maintaining a healthy weight . Clinicians should consider that patients with TP53 mutations with a history of previous malignancy are prone to the development of a second cancer .

Given the significance of breast cancer in female patients with LFS, a total bilateral prophylactic mastectomy has also been recommended; however, this decision should be made according to each individual’s status of health and personal history of cancer, familial history, principles, and wishes . 2.6 Treatment There is no approved and definite treatment for LFS, and most LFS patients undergo the conventional treatment strategies available for each cancer . The management of LFS almost entirely depends on a combination of surveillance protocols, risk reduction strategies, and therapeutic interventions tailored to the specific tumor types and clinical characteristics of affected individuals. The standard treatment regimens for LFS-related cancers have traditionally involved DNA-damaging systemic cytotoxic chemoradiation, which can lead to subsequent tumors . Meanwhile, recent studies have explored alternative therapeutic strategies that may offer more targeted and less genotoxic options for LFS patients. Table 5 presents recent and ongoing clinical trials focusing on LFS patients. The most common proposed therapeutic candidates are: 2.6.1 Immune checkpoint inhibitors Immune checkpoint inhibitors, chiefly the programmed cell death protein-1 and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1)- and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4)-targeting antibodies, have shown promising clinical activity in various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies associated with LFS [126, 127]. By blocking inhibitory signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment, these agents could enhance the antitumor immune response, potentially leading to tumor regression and prolonged patient survival . Studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities are underway to assess their efficacy and safety in individuals with LFS-associated cancers, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, and FDA-approval pending Sintilimab – which has been recently approved and included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) of China (Table 5) [129–135]. 2.6.2 Adoptive cell therapy Adoptive cell therapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, is another proposed approach for the treatment of LFS-associated malignancies [136, 137]. CAR T-cell therapy involves engineering the patients’ T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors targeting specific tumor antigens, while TIL therapy involves isolating and expanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with antitumor activity ex vivo before reinfusion into patients . The CAR T-cell-based combination strategies have demonstrated improved overall survival in previous studies [139, 140]. 2.6.3 Cytokine‑based therapies Cytokine-based therapies, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), modulate the immune response and enhance the antitumor activity of immune effector cells, including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [141, 142]. Cytokinebased therapies have been investigated as either monotherapy or in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents for LFS-associated malignancies [143–145]. 2.6.4 TP53 reactivators Small molecule drugs designed to reactivate mutant TP53 proteins represent a promising therapeutic strategy for individuals with LFS-associated tumors [146, 147]. Eprenetapopt (PRIMA-1Met, APR-246) and RITA (Reactivating p53 and Inducing Tumor Apoptosis) have shown preclinical efficacy in restoring the transcriptional activity, inducing cell cycle arrest, and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells with dysfunctional TP53 [133, 148–150].

(2024) 15:561 | 2.6.5 DNA damage response inhibitors DNA damage response (DDR) pathway-targeting agents, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitors, have shown efficacy in preclinical models of LFS-associated malignancies, particularly in tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) [151–154]. 2.6.6 Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are a class of targeted therapeutic agents that are generally considered in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) [23, 155, 156]. BTKi is vital in B-cell receptor signaling, lymphocyte activation, and proliferation . Small molecule BTK inhibitors irreversibly bind to the active site of BTK, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity and downstream signaling cascades, thus disrupting B-cell receptor signaling and promoting apoptosis of malignant B cells . Ongoing research efforts try to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BTK inhibitors, such as Acalabrutinib, in combination with other targeted therapies for LFS patients . 2.6.7 MDM2/X inhibitors MDM2/X inhibitors disrupt the interaction between murine double minute 2 (MDM2) or its homolog murine double minute X (MDMX) and the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction basically leads to apoptosis evade. By inhibiting MDM2/X, these small molecule inhibitors restore p53 function, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and tumor growth inhibition . From several experimental agents of this class, Milademetan (DS-3032b), Sulanemadlin (ALRN-6924), and Brigimadlin (BI 907828) are extensively studied, showing promising results in the very early trials [146, 160–163]. 2.6.8 Monoclonal antibodies Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically target the antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Initiating various mechanisms of action, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and blockade of tumor growth signaling pathways, several mAbs, such as Rituximab (anti-CD20), Obinutuzumab (anti-CD20), and Magrolimab (anti-CD47), are under investigation for LFS patients [164–167]. 2.6.9 Arsenic trioxide Arsenic trioxide is a cytotoxic agent primarily used in treatment-resistant leukemia . Preclinical studies have provided strong evidence for the potential positive impact of arsenic on the survival of LFS patients . Widely considered in early-phase trials of LFS treatment nowadays, arsenic trioxide is generally well-tolerated, but it could result in serious adverse effects, including QT interval prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [170–172]. Close monitoring of cardiac function, electrolyte levels, and hepatic function is recommended during treatment with arsenic trioxide to minimize the risk of adverse events. 2.6.10 Other agents Some existing medications and agents have also been explored as adjuvant LFS treatments. Metformin, a widely used oral antidiabetic agent, has attracted attention for its potential anticancer properties beyond its glucose-lowering effects [173, 174]. Metformin acts primarily by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, leading to inhibition of mTOR signaling, suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and modulation of cellular metabolism [175, 176]. Although Metformin might not be the primary choice of treatment in LFS patients, given its efficacy in modulating the metabolic profile, the low cost, and accessibility, it could be considered as a preventive agent, especially in individuals with metabolic disorders or obesity-associated cancers [177, 178]. Likewise, nicotinamide riboside, the precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), could lead to increased NAD+ levels, Vol:.(1234567890) Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Review thereby activating sirtuins and other NAD+-dependent enzymes involved in DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and mitochondrial function [179–181]. Previous studies have suggested that nicotinamide riboside enhances cellular stress resistance, inhibiting tumorigenesis and promoting cancer cell apoptosis [182, 183]. The chemopreventive approaches, using medications such as Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, have also been proven effective , but are still controversial due to their adverse effects and low patient compliance. 2.7 Challenges LFS, and the broader context of TP53 mutation research, face various challenges affecting both patients and healthcare providers, including: 2.7.1 Development of targeted therapies Although TP53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, developing therapies that effectively target mutant TP53 has proven difficult. 2.7.2 Variants of uncertain significance Variants of uncertain significance (VUS), the mutations that their impact – whether pathogenic or benign – on the molecular function and cancer risk is not fully understood, impose clinical challenges in genetic counseling, risk assessment, potential surveillance protocols, and decision-making for both patients and healthcare providers . Guidelines lack clear recommendations for this population, as the cancer risk associated with VUS is uncertain and lacks sufficient data. Although in silico models deliver useful predictions, these models are generally not sufficient to guide clinical decisionmaking . Meanwhile, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) TP53 variant curation expert panel has introduced a set of guidelines launched to classify TP53 variants, provide consistent and reliable interpretations of their clinical significance, and help distinguish pathogenic mutations from benign variants and VUS [187, 188]. 2.7.3 Germline vs somatic TP53 mutations Differentiating between germline and somatic mutations is one of the major challenges with TP53 mutations identified through NGS. While the inherited germline mutations lead to LFS, somatic mutations are not heritable. When a TP53 mutation is detected via an NGS panel, it is not immediately clear whether it is germline or somatic–possibly originating from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) . Misinterpretation of somatic TP53 mutations as germline can lead to unnecessary cancer surveillance in individuals who do not have LFS. Moreover, the detection of low variant allele frequencies (VAF) in TP53 mutations adds complexity to the interpretation. VAF represents the proportion of sequencing reads containing a variant, and low VAFs suggest somatic mutations arising from clonal hematopoiesis rather than true germline mutations . NGS panels often include TP53 to identify mutations for tumor profiling or assessing hereditary cancer risk. In older adults, however, or those with CHIP, TP53 mutations detected in blood or bone marrow samples may be false positives for germline testing, leading to misdiagnosis . Consequently, patients with a CHIP-related TP53 mutation might be unnecessarily subjected to LFS cancer surveillance for solid tumors due to the miscalculated cancer risk . Moreover, TP53 mutations with low VAF may lead to clinical dilemmas for testing family members, as the mutation may be somatic rather than germline. 2.7.4 Overlapping syndromes and genetic mimics LFS overlaps with some other cancer-predisposing syndromes, complicating the diagnosis and risk assessment. CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase two) and BRCA1/2 (breast cancer genes 1 and 2) are among the most famous LFS-mimicking mutations. For instance, mutations in CHEK2—also a tumor suppressor gene—referred to as the ‘CHEK2-associated Li–Fraumeni syndrome’ or ‘Li-Fraumeni syndrome 2’, are occasionally misclassified as a subtype of LFS . CHEK2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase regulating the cellular response to DNA damage, and its mutations result in a tumor predisposition syndrome, associated with a moderately increased risk for later-onset development of less broad cancers, including breast, prostate, and gastrointestinal tumors [191–193]. Moreover, CHEK2 is considered a low-penetrance gene compared Vol.:(0123456789) Review Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | to TP53, suggesting that not all individuals with CHEK2 mutations will develop cancer . Studies have highlighted the clear and significant distinctions in the clinical presentations of TP53 and CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers and the lack of association between CHEK2 and TP53-related LFS . While both TP53 and CHEK2 are involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression, CHEK2 mutations do not confer the same features as LFS, and since it could lead to inappropriate management and suboptimal surveillance, their classification as an LFS subtype is generally discouraged. 2.7.5 Limited long‑term data As only a small proportion of LFS patients show long-term adherence to the surveillance protocols, the long-term followup data on LFS patients, particularly in relation to the effectiveness of surveillance programs and therapeutic interventions, is limited, negatively affecting the development of clinical evidence-based prevention and treatment guidelines . The impact of intensive screening on patient survival and quality of life over long periods is not fully understood so far, and data on the long-term risks and complications, including the risks of radiation exposure from frequent imaging, are rare. 2.7.6 Cancer surveillance and overdiagnosis Lifelong cancer surveillance is essential for patients with confirmed pathogenic TP53 mutations. However, striking the right balance between early cancer detection and overdiagnosis still remains a significant challenge . Extensive screening protocols, often including annual whole-body MRIs, can lead to false-positive results or detection of indolent cancers that may never progress to a clinically significant disease. Meanwhile, some patients may not follow the full range of recommended screenings due to a lack of resources or understanding of the significance of TP53 mutations, potentially leading to missed early detection opportunities. 2.7.7 Access to care Access to genetic testing and specialized cancer care for individuals at risk of or diagnosed with LFS varies widely by region and healthcare system . In some areas, the availability of genetic testing, surveillance, and specialized treatments may be limited, creating disparities in patient outcomes. The cost of genetic testing, preventive surgeries, or frequent cancer screenings can be prohibitive for some families, potentially leaving patients with suboptimal care or late-stage cancer diagnoses. Moreover, not all clinicians are fully aware of LFS or the need for comprehensive genetic testing in patients with a family history of cancers, leading to inadequate care in some cases. 2.7.8 The complexity of multidisciplinary care The management of LFS requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving geneticists, oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, psychologists, and other specialists. Coordinating care across these domains can be difficult, particularly in healthcare settings without established protocols for hereditary cancer syndromes. 2.7.9 Psychosocial burden The psychosocial challenges faced by individuals with LFS are significant, as it often affects multiple generations within a family, leading to fear of developing cancer and anxiety about passing the mutation on to offspring . The ongoing stress of living with an increased risk of cancer, along with the emotional toll of frequent surveillance, can be overwhelming for patients and their families. 3 Future directions Advancements in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification of novel therapeutic agents and the development of targeted therapies for LFS-associated malignancies. Novel cancer therapies, including various cancer immunotherapy modalities, checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies, and various agents and methods of targeted therapy, hold promise in improving treatment outcomes and reducing cancer burden in individuals with LFS (Table 5). Vol:.(1234567890) Discover Oncology (2024) 15:561 | Review Additionally, ongoing research efforts aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying LFS pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification. Longitudinal cohort studies and populationbased registries are essential in clarifying the natural history, risk factors of recurrence, and outcomes associated with LFS. Furthermore, molecular epidemiological studies leveraging genomic technologies and bioinformatics analyses offer insights into the genetic determinants, mutational signatures, and clonal evolution patterns underlying LFS-associated tumorigenesis, guiding precision medicine approaches and targeted interventions tailored to the unique molecular profiles of individual tumors. 4 Conclusions Li-Fraumeni Syndrome poses significant challenges in clinical management due to its diverse spectrum of associated malignancies and the need for lifelong surveillance and interventions. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, screening strategies, and management options for LFS is crucial for optimizing patient care and outcomes. Continued research efforts aimed at clarifying the underlying mechanisms, optimum and effective surveillance strategies, and developing targeted therapeutic approaches are essential for improving the prognosis of individuals affected.
