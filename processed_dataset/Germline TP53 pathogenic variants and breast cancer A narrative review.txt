Multiple breast cancer predisposing genes, including TP53, are responsible for the increased breast cancer risk. Tumor protein-53 (TP53) germline PVs are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome associated with early-onset pediatric and multiple primary cancers such as soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas and leukemias. Women harboring a TP53 PV carry a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of 80–90%. The aim of the present narrative review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the criteria for offering TP53 testing, prevalence of TP53 carriers among patients with breast cancer, and what is known about its prognostic and therapeutic implications. A summary of the current indications of secondary cancer surveillance and survivorship issues are also provided. Finally, the spectrum of TP53 alteration and testing is discussed. The optimal strategies for the treatment of breast cancer in patients harboring TP53 PVs poses certain challenges. Current guidelines favor the option of performing mastectomy rather than lumpectomy to avoid adjuvant radiotherapy and subsequent risk of radiation-induced second primary malignancies, with careful consideration of radiation when indicated post-mastectomy. Some studies suggest that patients with breast cancer and germline TP53 PV might have worse survival outcomes compared to patients with breast cancer and wild type germline TP53 status. Annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whole-body MRI are recommended as secondary prevention. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women and the majority are considered sporadic cases . Around 10% of breast malignancies are associated with a germline pathogenic variant in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes and family history is often the telltale of an underlying inherited predisposition [2,3]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants are responsible for less than half of the * Corresponding author at: IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, 16132 Genova, Italy.

E. Blondeaux et al. variants involved in increased breast cancer risk and pathogenic variants in multiple other breast cancer predisposing genes, including TP53, are responsible for the remaining [4–6]. Tumor protein-53 (TP53) gene is a tumor suppressor which controls cell growth and division. It protects cells against genome changes resulting from DNA damage by suppressing proliferation or activating apoptosis . TP53 germline pathogenic variants are associated with heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes, classically named Li- Fraumeni syndrome (a rare autosomal dominant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome historically associated with early-onset pediatric and multiple primary cancers such as soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas, gastrointestinal, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers and leukemias [8–12]. More recently TP53 pathogenic variants were associated also with an increased risk of prostate cancer . The cumulative cancer risk associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome has been estimated to be approximately 50% by the age of 40 years and up to 90% by the age of 60 years with females reported to have a higher risk than males, mostly due to the increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer [15–17]. Indeed, healthy women harboring a TP53 pathogenic variant carry a lifetime risks of developing breast cancer of around 80–90%, higher than the risk of healthy BRCA carriers (lifetime risk of around 60–85%) [18–21]. The aim of the present narrative review is to give a comprehensive overview of all the aspects to be considered during the counselling of women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer and carrying (or suspected to carry) a TP53 pathogenic variant. Criteria for offering TP53 testing, prevalence of TP53 carriers among patients with breast cancer, prognostic and therapeutic implications are provided. Current indications of secondary cancer surveillance and survivorship issues are discussed. Finally, the spectrum of TP53 alteration and testing is discussed. Criteria for offering TP53 testing and prevalence of TP53 carriers among patients with breast cancer Different criteria for offering TP53 testing have been proposed (Table 1). The first Li-Fraumeni syndrome criteria were proposed by Li and Fraumeni in 1988 . Subsequently, less stringent Li-Fraumeni-like criteria were proposed in order to expand the proband’s cancer types to include childhood cancers, brain cancers, and adrenal cortical carcinoma, and to change the relatives’ age at the time of diagnosis to < 60 years [23,24]. Broader criteria were proposed by Chompret and colleagues in 2001 and a modified version of the Chompret criteria was proposed by Bougeard and colleagues in 2015 with the recommendation to offer TP53 testing to patients with breast cancer diagnosis before age 31, regardless of family history [25,26]. Sensitivity and specificity of these criteria have been estimated to be around 90% and 50% respectively [26,29–31]. However, TP53 carriers could also be identified in families who do not fulfill these clinical criteria due to a wide variety of phenotypes within the same syndrome, different tumor spectrum, age at diagnosis or sporadic occurrence of a germline pathogenic variant [26,30]. Indeed, it is estimated that at least 14% of germline TP53 carriers have a de novo pathogenic variant . Thus, the lack of a positive family history does not exclude the possibility of the identification of a TP53 pathogenic variant in the patient . In 2020, the European Reference Network GENTURIS expanded the revised Chompret criteria. Children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, medulloblastoma or jaw osteosarcoma, as well as children with any type of cancer from southern and south-eastern Brazilian families and patients affected by second primary malignancy within the radiotherapy field of a first core TP53 tumor were also considered eligible for TP53 testing . Despite the available evidence regarding the higher prevalence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer among TP53 carriers , none of the above-mentioned criteria consider histopathological features of Table 1 Criteria for offering TP53 testing.

In breast cancer-specific testing criteria proposed by Evans and colleagues, different age thresholds are proposed for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer or phyllode tumor . Recommendations about TP53 testing derive from several studies evaluating the prevalence of TP53 germline carriers in selected patients with breast cancer (Table 2). In highly selected cohorts of patients around 5% harbor a TP53 germline pathogenic variant, including women with breast cancer who meet the criteria of heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes or even family history of breast cancer those who have a strong [26,30,36,37,41,42,51–53]. Whereas the frequency of TP53 germline carriers in unselected patients with breast cancer is less then 0.5% [5,6,54]. In two population-based study that aimed to estimate the cancer risk related to different breast cancer susceptibility genes, TP53 pathogenic variant were identified in 19 (0.06%) out of 32,247 unselected patients with breast cancer (CARRIERS consortium) and in 7 (0.01%) out of 48,826 unselected patients with breast cancer (Breast Cancer Association Consortium) [5,6]. In a cohort of 364 female patients from the Netherlands diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 30 years, 8 (2.2%) patients harbored a (likely) pathogenic TP53 variant . Among them, 6 patients had a personal or familial history suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome . In an Australian population-based cohort of invasive breast cancers, TP53 (likely) pathogenic variants were detected in 2 (4%) out of 52 women diagnosed before age of 30 unselected for family history and in 3 (7%) out of 42 women diagnosed in their 30s with two or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer . In a cohort of 100 Polish females with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 30 years and positive family history of cancer, prevalence of TP53 pathogenic variant was 4% . To note that the identification of a pathogenic variant can be influenced by the method used to detect the variant, thus absolute frequencies of TP53 germline carriers should be interpreted with caution. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technique, the broader diagnostic criteria and more inclusive testing criteria will lead to a considerably higher prevalence of germline TP53 pathogenic variants detection and the identification of less penetrant Li-Fraumeni Table 2 Studies exploring TP53 germline pathogenic variant prevalence among selected patients with breast cancer.

In fact, multigene panel studies gave the possibility to broaden the phenotypic spectrum of Li-Fraumeni syndrome identifying TP53 germline pathogenic variants in individuals who do not fulfill established clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome testing [12,54,55]. Breast cancer subtypes arising in TP53 carriers Patients harboring TP53 pathogenic variants may develop distinct breast cancer subtypes. Some previous reports suggested that patients harboring germline TP53 pathogenic variants are more likely to develop HER2-positive breast cancers (Table 3). In particular, a multicenter international case-control analysis of the BRIDGES study including 42,680 patients and 46,387 controls aimed to characterize tumors associated with different breast cancer susceptibility genes . Among the 42,680 patients included, 51 harbored a TP53 pathogenic variant. TP53 carriers were found to have a greater chance to develop HER2-positive breast cancers (46% of cases) . Moreover, TP53 carriers were more likely to have mixed lobular and ductal tumors than ductal carcinoma (OR 7.01, 95% CI 3.04–16.17) . In a Brazilian cohort of 91 TP53 female carriers, breast cancer was the first malignancy diagnosed in 90% of the women, of whom 78% had an early-onset breast cancer (i.e. age ≤ 45 years) . Moreover, bilateral breast cancer was observed in 29% of the patients. Overall, 41% of the tumors were HER2- positive, and 33% were positive for both hormone receptor and HER2 . Many other studies with<50 patients provided similar results with a prevalence of HER2 positivity ranging between 34 and 83% (Table 3) [33,56–63], clearly higher than expected in an unselected breast cancer population (15–20%) [65,66].

However, few data are available regarding clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer according to germline TP53 mutation status. In a cohort of 10,053 unselected Chinese patients with early-stage breast cancer, the 50 patients with a germline TP53 pathogenic variant had significantly worse relapse-free survival (adjusted HR = 2.24; 95%CI 1.15–4.33; p = 0.02), distant relapse-free survival (adjusted HR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.41–5.30; p = 0.003) and overall survival (adjusted HR = 4.60; 95%CI, 2.26–9.41; p < 0.001) as compared to patients with early stage breast cancer and wild type TP53 germline status . A second study, including the first cohort of 10,053 unselected Chinese patients with breast cancer and a second cohort of 1820 patients with breast cancer selected by age at diagnosis or family history of any cancer, demonstrated that the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast conserving surgery was significantly higher in TP53 carriers than in non- carriers (21.1% vs 3.8%) . Moreover, the 10-year risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers (17.9% vs 3.6%; HR 7.0 95% CI 3.3–14.9; p < 0.001) . A study conducted by Hyder and colleagues in England aimed to determine the risk of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 (N = 218), BRCA2 (N = 132), and TP53 (N = 47) carriers with very early-onset (<36 years) breast cancer . Results indicate that the risk of contralateral breast cancer was significantly higher in TP53 carriers compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. The 10 and 20-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer was 53% (95%CI 30–81) and 82% (95%CI 50–99) for TP53 carriers as compared to 32% (95% CI 24–43) and 57% (95% CI 45–69) in BRCA1 carriers and 21% (95% CI 13.0–32.1) and 45% (95% CI 31.4–61.9) for BRCA2 carriers . The difference in 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers among these two studies (i.e., 17.9% in the Chinese and 53% in the English study) could be attributable to the different populations, being unselected for the first one and highly selected for the second one. To our knowledge, no data are available regarding survival outcomes of metastatic breast cancer patients according to germline TP53 mutational status. Special considerations regarding breast cancer treatment in TP53 carriers are required. As suggested by different studies, the risk of secondary radiation- induced malignancies reaches up to more than 30% among patients with TP53 pathogenic variants treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. Among 16 Brazilian patients with breast cancer and germline TP53 p. R337H pathogenic variant, 12 received adjuvant radiotherapy. After a median follow-up exceeding 50 months, 2 (16.7%) patients developed a radiotherapy-induced sarcoma . In a group of 18 patients with a TP53 pathogenic variant treated with radiation in a curative setting, after a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 2 (11.1%) patients developed a radiation-induced malignancy: one patient developed thyroid cancer, and the other developed sarcoma in the radiation field . In a French cohort of 8 Li–Fraumeni patients with breast cancer, 6 received radiotherapy and 2 of them (33.3%) developed a secondary malignancy in the radiation field after a median follow-up of 6 years . The secondary malignancies documented were an angiosarcoma and a fibrosarcoma . Moreover, one patient developed papillary thyroid carcinoma inside the radiation field . Other smaller case-series showed similar results [61,75–77]. Due to the risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancies after radiotherapy, a careful decision-making process with regard to risk–benefit ratios on the use of radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer harboring a germline TP53 pathogenic variant is warranted. Current guidelines recommend that decisions about adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered with a multidisciplinary team and patient, with careful weighing of the risks and benefits, especially for patients Other findings Anticancer treatments CancerTreatmentReviews114(2023)1025224 E. Blondeaux et al. who need adjuvant radiotherapy after mastectomy . To our knowledge, no evidence is available on the safety of radiation- guided imaging, such as bone scintigraphy, computed tomography scans and positron emission tomography scans, in patients with TP53 pathogenic variant. Regarding surgical management, several considerations should be made. Current guidelines recommend that radiation therapy should be avoided whenever possible due to the risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancies and that mastectomy rather than lumpectomy is preferable [27,78–80]. Moreover, as observed in BRCA carriers who have a significantly increased risk of further loco-regional disease but no increased risk of dying when treated with breast conserving surgery as compared to mastectomy, we might assume that similarly, mastectomy could also play a role in reducing the role of locoregional recurrences in TP53 carriers . However, no robust data are available in this population. No information on the prognostic impact of the timing of risk- reducing mastectomy on life expectancy is available among TP53 carriers. A study performed in BRCA carriers seem to indicate that the benefit of risk-reducing mastectomy is higher if mastectomy is performed at the age of 25 years but the benefit declines rapidly with increasing age at surgery . Thus, due to the higher risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, current guidelines recommend discussing contralateral risk- reducing mastectomy . However, the other cancer risks associated with TP53 pathogenic variants should be taken into account during the surgical counselling . Regarding the use of chemotherapy, Kasper and colleagues suggested that radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies could increase the risk of new tumor development in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome mouse model. In particular, TP53 mutant mice exposed to genotoxic agent (i.e. etoposide) had an increased risk of tumor development, whereas the exposure to non-genotoxic mitotic spindle agents (i.e. docetaxel) had no impact . In humans, the demonstration of the potential contribution of chemotherapy to the development of subsequent primary tumors among TP53 carriers derives from patients treated for childhood cancers . Based on these findings, the European Reference Network GENTURIS recommends that priority should be given to surgical or ablative treatments, avoiding radiotherapy and preferring the use of non-genotoxic chemotherapies in the treatment of TP53-associated neoplasms . Focusing on breast cancer treatment, despite HER2-positive tumors is the most frequent subtype among patients with TP53 pathogenic variants, no data on treatment response to different chemotherapeutic and targeted therapy agents are available. A small study showed that TP53 carriers treated with carboplatin-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy reached a higher rate of pathological complete response as compared to patients treated with standard anthracycline-based or taxane-based chemotherapy regimens . Recently, poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been studied in patients with a pathogenic variant in homologous recombination genes other than BRCA. However, TP53 is not involved in the homologous recombination path, thus germline TP53 carriers were excluded from both the TBCRC-048 and the Talazoparib Beyond BRCA trial [85,86]. Survivorship Guidelines recommend that TP53 carriers should follow a dedicated cancer surveillance protocol [27,87,88]. Guidelines and recommendations for second primary cancer surveillance among adult female TP53 carriers are summarized in Table 4. Current guidelines agree to recommend annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (from age 20) for breast cancer surveillance, and to discuss with patients the possibility to undergo risk-reducing mastectomy [27,78,80,89–91,88,87,92]. On the contrary, there is no consensus on the use of mammography, only routinely recommended by the NCCN guidelines and by the TORONTO protocol, [80,89] or in case Table 4 Guidelines and recommendations for surveillance in adult female TP53 carriers.

Considering the high risk of developing other tumors correlated with the presence of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant, especially brain malignancies, soft tissue and bone sarcoma, melanoma, and the increased rate of gastrointestinal cancer, all guidelines agree to recommend annual whole-body MRI (generally from the age of 20) and annual brain MRI. Overall, there is agreement among guidelines that MRI should be preferred for secondary prevention over radiation-guided imaging. Conversely, there is no consensus whether or not to offer endoscopy surveillance of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract: most guidelines suggest to tailor the indication and timing according to the family history. Many trials are currently ongoing with the aim of determine diagnostic efficacy of different surveillance imaging techniques and protocols among patients with TP53 pathogenic variants (NCT03176836, NCT01464086, NCT02950987). In summary, according to guidelines, surveillance for breast cancer should be based on annual breast MRI starting at the age of 20 and risk- reducing surgery should be discussed with the patients (Fig. 1). For brain tumors and sarcoma, annual whole-body MRI should be performed since birth while gastrointestinal and melanoma secondary prevention should be considered in adulthood (Fig. 2). Regular follow up of patients with breast cancer should be scheduled based on current guidelines, considering not only the type of tumor, its biology and the treatment received, but also minimizing the diagnostic radiation in order to reduce the risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancies in these patients. Contrast-free diffusion-weighted whole- body MRI has proved to be effective for staging and follow-up in patients with breast cancer [89,93–96]. Finally, although limited evidence exist on the topic, all TP53 carriers should be made aware of their risk of malignancy and the possible symptoms as well as encouraged to make positive lifestyle choices (e.g., not smoking, limit alcohol and red meat consumption, high fruits and vegetables intake, physical exercise, sun protection). An analysis of lifestyle factors and health behavior among TP53 carriers suggested that women with a TP53 carriers have healthier diet and smoked less compared to their relatives although no difference was observed in physical activity . Other components of survivorship care in TP53 carriers should be acknowledged. Survivorship trajectory of cancer patients is made not only by surveillance of recurrence and second primary malignancies but also by dealing with physical effects of cancer and chronic medical conditions, psychological effects and its social, work and financial implications .

Recommended if the carrier received abdominal radiotherapy or if there is a family history of upper GI and/or colorectal tumors found, mosaicism and clonal hematopoiesis should be considered. Pathogenic variants are assumed to be of germline origin when the allele frequency is approximately 50%; however, low variant allele frequencies (i.e., < 25–35%) might be found in a genetic report. In this case, minor allele frequency pathogenic variant is the result of a mutational event happened at a post-zygotic stage thus only tissues derived from the mutated cell will carry the pathogenic variant . If the mutation is restricted to the hematopoietic compartment, it is called clonal hematopoiesis. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis increases with age and that clonal CancerTreatmentReviews114(2023)1025227 E. Blondeaux et al. hematopoiesis can be found in a significant portion of the healthy population [100–103]. Clonal hematopoiesis has most frequently been reported with TP53 gene compared to other breast cancer susceptibility gene . Thus, in case of detection of minor allele frequency TP53 pathogenic variant the possibility of mosaicism should be ruled out as in this case different therapeutic and genetic counselling needs are implicated . Identification of a TP53 pathogenic variant does not always translate into the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The different pathogenic variants can have different penetrance and thus different phenotypes. A pathogenic variant with reduced penetrance will possibly lead to an older age of occurrence of cancers of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome spectrum. For example, the funder mutation p.R181C in the TP53 gene was found among 9 out of 453 Palestinian young women with breast cancer. None of the families that harbored the TP53 p.R181C likely pathogenic variant fulfilled the clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Similarly, the penetrance of the p.R337H TP53 pathogenic variant seem to be incomplete. In Southern Brazil, the population prevalence of TP53 p.R337H pathogenic variant is 0.3%. In the Brazilian population, this variant seems to be associated with adrenocortical tumors in children but not with other cancers typical of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome [105–107]. Understanding the factors that lead to phenotypic differences among TP53 carries is important to tailor the surveillance program and counselling. The classification of the Li-Fraumeni spectrum suggested by Kratz and colleagues seem to be a valid approach to classify the different phenotypic spectrums of TP53 variants . Authors classified germline TP53 variants of 3034 persons into: phenotypic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (i.e., absence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in person meeting clinical Li-Fraumeni syndrome criteria), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (i.e, presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in person meeting Li-Fraumeni syndrome testing criteria), attenuated Li-Fraumeni syndrome (i.e., presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in a person with cancer who does not meet Li- Fraumeni syndrome testing criteria), incidental Li-Fraumeni syndrome (i.e, presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in a person without a history of cancer). Results showed that patients who met Li- Fraumeni syndrome genetic testing criteria have more frequently early adrenal, brain, connective tissue, or bone tumors. While carriers who did not meet Li-Fraumeni syndrome genetic testing criteria had more breast and other cancers (45% of them occurring after age 45 years) . Identification of germline TP53 pathogenic variants in a breast cancer individual triggers cascade genetic testing of relatives (including children) for early diagnosis through increased surveillance and prevention. As the information regarding the identification of a pathogenic variant in the family relies in proband (proband-mediated procedure), it is uncertain whether all eligible relatives access testing. To our knowledge, no results on the uptake of TP53 testing among at-risk family members are available. Moreover, testing of asymptomatic children at risk of Li Fraumeni syndrome remained controversial for a long time, due to the lack of proven medical benefit of screening, concern about informed consent and potential stigmatization and discrimination towards the minor . However, due to emerging screening protocols showing potential efficacy, testing of at-risk children is becoming more widespread in those institutions where access to whole-body MRI is available [89,94]. Nevertheless, future research should also focus on the long-term clinical and psychosocial impacts of TP53 genetic testing and early detection of such pathogenic variants in minors. Finally, among young carriers of a pathogenic variant in breast cancer susceptibly genes, further burden is given by family planning with the 50% risk of transmission of the pathogenic variant to the offspring. Thus, current guidelines recommend that TP53 carriers should be offered preimplantation genetic testing (in the case of in vitro fertilization) or prenatal diagnosis (in case of natural conception) [110,111]. However, barriers to the uptake of these techniques are similar to the ones faced by BRCA carriers and include the lack of availability and high cost of the procedure, ethical regulations and burden of additional psychological distress . To our knowledge, no information is available regarding awareness, acceptance, and uptake of preimplantation genetic testing and prenatal testing among TP53 carriers. Conclusions In patients with breast cancer, the prevalence of patients with germline pathogenic variants in TP53 ranges from <0.5% in unselected patients with breast cancer to around 5–10% in highly selected patients with breast cancer such as those with very young age at diagnosis or with strong family history. Regarding locoregional treatment, current guidelines recommend that radiotherapy should be avoided and mastectomy should be preferred to lumpectomy [27,78,79]. Moreover, risk- reducing contralateral mastectomy should be discussed, and annual breast MRI screening is recommended as secondary prevention [27,78,79]. Whole-body MRI should be used for secondary cancer surveillance. No information is available regarding potential differences in treatment efficacy and indications among TP53 carriers. Considering their potential worse breast cancer prognosis and risk of developing secondary malignancies, special attention should be paid to signs or symptoms suggesting the occurrence of these events. The identification of a TP53 pathogenic variant is not a straightforward to the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome as different penetrance and phenotypes are present. No information on the uptake of cascade testing to at-risk family individuals is available and limited evidence exist on the implication of genetic testing in minors. Current guidelines recommend that preimplantation genetic testing and prenatal testing should be offered to patients willing to conceive [110,111]. Finally, the identification of a minor allele frequency of pathogenic variant needs further evaluations to rule out the possibility of mosaicism that can affect both cascade testing and preimplantation and prenatal testing. Considering the limited data available to counsel patients with breast cancer and germline TP53 pathogenic variants, the low level of evidence on some of the topic presented, the relatively rarity of this condition, and the interpretation of TP53 found in the blood for other reason (e.g. clonal hematopoiesis and mosaicism), collaborative research efforts are strongly encouraged in order to provide more solid answers to improve and better tailor the care of this special patient population.
