Approximately 10% of breast cancers are associated with the inheritance of a pathogenic variant (PV) in one of 
the breast cancer susceptibility genes. Multiple breast cancer predisposing genes, including TP53, are responsible 
for the increased breast cancer risk. 

Tumor protein-53 (TP53) germline PVs are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant 
inherited  cancer  predisposition  syndrome  associated  with  early-onset  pediatric  and  multiple  primary  cancers 
such as soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas and leukemias. 
Women harboring a TP53 PV carry a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of 80–90%. 

The aim of the present narrative review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the criteria for offering 
TP53  testing,  prevalence  of  TP53  carriers  among  patients  with  breast  cancer,  and  what  is  known  about  its 
prognostic and therapeutic implications. A summary of the current indications of secondary cancer surveillance 
and survivorship issues are also provided. Finally, the spectrum of TP53 alteration and testing is discussed. 

The optimal strategies for the treatment of breast cancer in patients harboring TP53 PVs poses certain chal-
lenges. Current guidelines favor the option of performing mastectomy rather than lumpectomy to avoid adjuvant 
radiotherapy and subsequent risk of radiation-induced second primary malignancies, with careful consideration 
of radiation when indicated post-mastectomy. Some studies suggest that patients with breast cancer and germline 
TP53 PV might have worse survival outcomes compared to patients with breast cancer and wild type germline 
TP53 status. Annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whole-body MRI are recommended as sec-
ondary prevention.   

Introduction 

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women and 
the majority are considered sporadic cases [1]. Around 10% of breast 

malignancies are associated with a germline pathogenic variant in one of 
the  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes  and  family  history  is  often  the 
telltale  of  an  underlying  inherited  predisposition  [2,3].  BRCA1  and 
BRCA2  pathogenic  variants  are  responsible  for  less  than  half  of  the

variants involved in increased breast cancer risk and pathogenic variants 
in multiple other breast cancer predisposing genes, including TP53, are 
responsible for the remaining [4–6]. 

Tumor protein-53 (TP53) gene is a tumor suppressor which controls 
cell  growth  and  division.  It  protects  cells  against  genome  changes 
resulting from DNA damage by suppressing proliferation or activating 
apoptosis  [7]. TP53  germline pathogenic  variants  are  associated  with 
heritable  TP53-related  cancer  syndromes,  classically  named  Li- 
Fraumeni  syndrome  (https://www.omim.org/entry/151623),  a  rare 
autosomal dominant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome histori-
cally associated with early-onset pediatric and multiple primary cancers 
such  as  soft  tissue  and  bone  sarcomas,  breast  cancer,  brain  tumors, 
adrenocortical carcinomas, gastrointestinal, lung, pancreatic and pros-
tate  cancers  and  leukemias  [8–12].  More  recently  TP53  pathogenic 
variants were associated also with an increased risk of prostate cancer 
[13]. The cumulative cancer risk associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
has been estimated to be approximately 50% by the age of 40 years and 
up to 90% by the age of 60 years [14] with females reported to have a 
higher  risk  than  males,  mostly  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  premeno-
pausal breast cancer [15–17]. Indeed, healthy women harboring a TP53 
pathogenic variant carry a lifetime risks of developing breast cancer of 
around 80–90%, higher than the risk of healthy BRCA carriers (lifetime 
risk of around 60–85%) [18–21]. 

The aim of the present narrative review is to give a comprehensive 
overview of all the aspects to be considered during the counselling of 
women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer and carrying (or suspected 
to carry) a TP53 pathogenic variant. Criteria for offering TP53 testing, 
prevalence  of  TP53 carriers  among  patients with  breast cancer,  prog-
nostic and therapeutic implications are provided. Current indications of 
secondary  cancer  surveillance  and  survivorship  issues  are  discussed. 
Finally, the spectrum of TP53 alteration and testing is discussed. 

Criteria for offering TP53 testing and prevalence of TP53 carriers 
among patients with breast cancer 

Different  criteria  for  offering  TP53  testing  have  been  proposed 

(Table 1). 

The  first  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  criteria  were  proposed  by  Li  and 
Fraumeni  in  1988  [22].  Subsequently,  less  stringent  Li-Fraumeni-like 
criteria were proposed in order to expand the proband’s cancer types 
to include childhood cancers, brain cancers, and adrenal cortical carci-
noma, and to change the relatives’ age at the time of diagnosis to < 60 
years  [23,24].  Broader  criteria  were  proposed  by  Chompret  and  col-
leagues in 2001 and a modified version of the Chompret criteria was 
proposed by Bougeard and colleagues in 2015 with the recommendation 
to offer TP53 testing to patients with breast cancer diagnosis before age 
31,  regardless  of  family  history  [25,26].  Sensitivity  and  specificity  of 
these criteria have been estimated to be around 90% and 50% respec-
tively [26,29–31]. However,  TP53 carriers could also  be identified in 
families who do not fulfill these clinical criteria due to a wide variety of 
phenotypes within the same syndrome, different tumor spectrum, age at 
diagnosis  or  sporadic  occurrence  of  a  germline  pathogenic  variant 
[26,30].  Indeed,  it  is  estimated  that  at  least  14%  of  germline  TP53 
carriers  have  a  de  novo  pathogenic  variant  [32].  Thus,  the  lack  of  a 
positive family history does not exclude the possibility of the identifi-
cation of a TP53 pathogenic variant in the patient [33]. 

In 2020, the European Reference Network GENTURIS expanded the 
revised  Chompret  criteria.  Children  and  adolescents  with  acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia, medulloblastoma or jaw osteosarcoma, as well 
as  children  with  any  type  of  cancer  from  southern  and  south-eastern 
Brazilian families and patients affected by second primary malignancy 
within  the  radiotherapy  field  of  a  first  core  TP53  tumor  were  also 
considered eligible for TP53 testing [27]. Despite the available evidence 
regarding the higher prevalence of human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer among TP53 carriers [34], none 
of the above-mentioned criteria consider histopathological features of

breast  cancer.  In  breast  cancer-specific  testing  criteria  proposed  by 
Evans and colleagues, different age thresholds are proposed for patients 
with HER2 positive breast cancer or phyllode tumor [28]. 

Recommendations  about  TP53  testing  derive  from  several  studies 
evaluating the prevalence of TP53 germline carriers in selected patients 
with breast cancer (Table 2). 

In  highly  selected  cohorts  of  patients  around  5%  harbor  a  TP53 

germline pathogenic variant, including women with breast cancer who 
meet  the  criteria  of  heritable  TP53-related  cancer  syndromes  or  even 
family  history  of  breast  cancer 
those  who  have  a  strong 
[26,30,36,37,41,42,51–53].  Whereas  the  frequency  of  TP53  germline 
carriers  in  unselected  patients  with  breast  cancer  is  less  then  0.5% 
[5,6,54].  In  two  population-based  study  that  aimed  to  estimate  the 
cancer risk related to different breast cancer susceptibility genes, TP53 
pathogenic variant were identified in 19 (0.06%) out of 32,247 unse-
lected  patients  with  breast  cancer  (CARRIERS  consortium)  and  in  7 
(0.01%)  out  of  48,826  unselected  patients  with  breast  cancer  (Breast 
Cancer Association Consortium) [5,6]. 

In a cohort of 364 female patients from the Netherlands diagnosed 
with breast cancer before the age of 30 years, 8 (2.2%) patients harbored 
a (likely) pathogenic TP53 variant [33]. Among them, 6 patients had a 
personal or familial history suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome [33]. In 
an Australian population-based cohort of invasive breast cancers, TP53 
(likely) pathogenic variants were detected in 2 (4%) out of 52 women 
diagnosed before age of 30 unselected for family history and in 3 (7%) 
out  of  42  women  diagnosed  in  their  30s  with  two  or  more  first-  or 
second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer [40]. In a cohort of 
100 Polish females with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 30 
years and positive family history of cancer, prevalence of TP53 patho-
genic variant was 4% [48]. 

To note that the identification of a pathogenic variant can be influ-
enced  by  the  method  used  to  detect  the  variant,  thus  absolute  fre-
quencies of TP53 germline carriers should be interpreted with caution. 
The  introduction  of  next-generation  sequencing  technique,  the 
broader diagnostic criteria and more inclusive testing criteria will lead 
to a considerably higher prevalence of germline TP53 pathogenic vari-
ants  detection  and  the  identification  of  less  penetrant  Li-Fraumeni

syndrome [19,37]. In fact, multigene panel studies gave the possibility 
to  broaden the phenotypic  spectrum of Li-Fraumeni  syndrome identi-
fying  TP53  germline  pathogenic  variants  in  individuals  who  do  not 
fulfill  established  clinical  criteria  for  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  testing 
[12,54,55]. 

Breast cancer subtypes arising in TP53 carriers 

Patients  harboring  TP53  pathogenic  variants  may  develop  distinct 
breast cancer subtypes. Some previous reports suggested that patients 
harboring germline TP53 pathogenic variants are more likely to develop 
HER2-positive breast cancers (Table 3). 

In particular, a multicenter international case-control analysis of the 
BRIDGES study including 42,680 patients and 46,387 controls aimed to 
characterize tumors associated with different breast cancer susceptibil-
ity genes [34]. Among the 42,680 patients included, 51 harbored a TP53 
pathogenic variant. TP53 carriers were found to have a greater chance to 
develop HER2-positive breast cancers (46% of cases) [34]. Moreover, 
TP53 carriers were more likely to have mixed lobular and ductal tumors 
than ductal carcinoma (OR 7.01, 95% CI 3.04–16.17) [34]. In a Brazilian 
cohort of 91 TP53 female carriers, breast cancer was the first malignancy 
diagnosed in 90% of the women, of whom 78% had an early-onset breast 
cancer (i.e. age ≤ 45 years) [64]. Moreover, bilateral breast cancer was 
observed in 29% of the patients. Overall, 41% of the tumors were HER2- 
positive, and 33% were positive for both hormone receptor and HER2 
[64]. 

Many other studies with<50 patients provided similar results with a 
prevalence of HER2 positivity ranging between 34 and 83% (Table 3) 
[33,56–63], clearly higher than expected in an unselected breast cancer 
population (15–20%) [65,66].

10,053 unselected Chinese patients with early-stage breast cancer, the 
50 patients with a germline TP53 pathogenic variant had significantly 
worse relapse-free survival (adjusted HR = 2.24; 95%CI 1.15–4.33; p =
0.02),  distant  relapse-free  survival  (adjusted  HR  = 2.73;  95%CI 
1.41–5.30; p = 0.003) and overall survival (adjusted HR = 4.60; 95%CI, 
2.26–9.41; p < 0.001) as compared to patients with early stage breast 
cancer  and  wild  type  TP53  germline  status  [8].  A  second  study, 
including  the  first  cohort  of  10,053  unselected  Chinese  patients  with 
breast cancer and a second cohort of 1820 patients with breast cancer 
selected  by  age  at  diagnosis  or  family  history  of  any  cancer,  demon-
strated that the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast 
conserving surgery was significantly higher in TP53 carriers than in non- 
carriers (21.1% vs 3.8%) [71]. Moreover, the 10-year risk of contralat-
eral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in 
non-carriers (17.9% vs 3.6%; HR 7.0 95% CI 3.3–14.9; p < 0.001) [71]. 
A  study  conducted  by  Hyder  and  colleagues  in  England  aimed  to 
determine the risk of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 (N = 218), 
BRCA2  (N  = 132),  and  TP53  (N  = 47)  carriers  with  very  early-onset 
(<36  years)  breast  cancer  [72].  Results  indicate  that  the  risk  of 
contralateral  breast  cancer  was  significantly  higher  in  TP53  carriers 
compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. The 10 and 20-year cumulative 
risk  of  contralateral  breast  cancer  was  53%  (95%CI  30–81)  and  82% 
(95%CI 50–99) for TP53 carriers as compared to 32% (95% CI 24–43) 
and  57%  (95%  CI  45–69)  in  BRCA1  carriers  and  21%  (95%  CI 
13.0–32.1) and 45% (95% CI 31.4–61.9) for BRCA2 carriers [72]. The 
difference in 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in 
TP53 carriers among these two studies (i.e., 17.9% in the Chinese and 
53%  in  the  English  study)  could  be  attributable  to  the  different  pop-
ulations, being unselected for the first one and highly selected for the 
second one. 

To our knowledge, no data are available regarding survival outcomes 
of metastatic breast cancer patients according to germline TP53 muta-
tional status. 

Special  considerations  regarding  breast  cancer  treatment  in  TP53 

carriers are required. 

As  suggested  by  different  studies,  the  risk  of  secondary  radiation- 
induced  malignancies  reaches  up  to  more  than  30%  among  patients 
with  TP53  pathogenic  variants  treated  with  adjuvant  radiotherapy. 
Among 16 Brazilian patients with breast cancer and germline TP53 p. 
R337H pathogenic variant, 12 received adjuvant radiotherapy. After a 
median follow-up exceeding 50 months, 2 (16.7%) patients developed a 
radiotherapy-induced  sarcoma  [73].  In  a  group  of  18  patients  with  a 
TP53  pathogenic  variant  treated  with  radiation  in  a  curative  setting, 
after a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 2 (11.1%) patients developed a 
radiation-induced  malignancy:  one  patient  developed  thyroid  cancer, 
and the other developed sarcoma in the radiation field [60]. In a French 
cohort of 8 Li–Fraumeni patients with breast cancer, 6 received radio-
therapy and 2 of them (33.3%) developed a secondary malignancy in the 
radiation field after a median follow-up of 6 years [74]. The secondary 
malignancies  documented  were  an  angiosarcoma  and  a  fibrosarcoma 
[74]. Moreover, one patient developed papillary thyroid carcinoma in-
side the radiation field [74]. Other smaller case-series showed similar 
results [61,75–77]. 

Due  to  the  risk  of  radiation-induced  secondary  malignancies  after 
radiotherapy,  a  careful  decision-making  process  with  regard  to 
risk–benefit  ratios  on  the  use  of  radiotherapy  in  patients  with  breast 
cancer  harboring  a  germline  TP53  pathogenic  variant  is  warranted. 
Current  guidelines  recommend  that  decisions  about  adjuvant  radio-
therapy should be considered with a multidisciplinary team and patient, 
with careful weighing of the risks and benefits, especially for patients

who need adjuvant radiotherapy after mastectomy [78]. 

To our knowledge, no evidence is available on the safety of radiation- 
guided imaging, such as bone scintigraphy, computed tomography scans 
and positron emission tomography scans, in patients with TP53 patho-
genic variant. 

Regarding  surgical  management,  several  considerations  should  be 
made. Current guidelines recommend that radiation therapy should be 
avoided  whenever  possible  due  to  the  risk  of  radiation-induced  sec-
ondary malignancies and that mastectomy rather than lumpectomy is 
preferable  [27,78–80].  Moreover,  as  observed  in  BRCA  carriers  who 
have a significantly increased risk of further loco-regional disease but no 
increased risk of dying when treated with breast conserving surgery as 
compared to mastectomy, we might assume that similarly, mastectomy 
could also play a role in reducing the role of locoregional recurrences in 
TP53  carriers  [81].  However,  no  robust  data  are  available  in  this 
population. 

No  information  on  the  prognostic  impact  of  the  timing  of  risk- 
reducing mastectomy on life expectancy is available among TP53 car-
riers.  A  study  performed  in  BRCA  carriers  seem  to  indicate  that  the 
benefit  of  risk-reducing  mastectomy  is  higher  if  mastectomy  is  per-
formed  at  the  age  of  25  years  but  the  benefit  declines  rapidly  with 
increasing age at surgery [82]. Thus, due to the higher risk of contra-
lateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 
carriers,  current  guidelines  recommend  discussing  contralateral  risk- 
reducing mastectomy [78]. However, the other cancer risks associated 
with TP53 pathogenic variants should be taken into account during the 
surgical counselling [72]. 

Regarding the use of chemotherapy, Kasper and colleagues suggested 
that radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies could increase the risk 
of new tumor development in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome mouse model. In 
particular, TP53 mutant mice exposed to genotoxic agent (i.e. etoposide) 
had an increased risk of tumor development, whereas the exposure to 
non-genotoxic  mitotic  spindle  agents  (i.e.  docetaxel)  had  no  impact 
[83].  In  humans,  the  demonstration  of  the  potential  contribution  of 
chemotherapy to the development of subsequent primary tumors among 
TP53 carriers derives from patients treated for childhood cancers [84]. 
Based on these findings, the European Reference Network  GENTURIS 
recommends that priority should be given to surgical or ablative treat-
ments, avoiding radiotherapy and preferring the use of non-genotoxic 
chemotherapies  in  the  treatment  of  TP53-associated  neoplasms  [27]. 
Focusing on breast cancer treatment, despite HER2-positive tumors is 
the most frequent subtype among patients with TP53 pathogenic vari-
ants, no data on treatment response to different chemotherapeutic and 
targeted therapy agents are available. A small study showed that TP53 
carriers treated with carboplatin-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
reached a higher rate of pathological complete response as compared to 
patients  treated  with  standard  anthracycline-based  or  taxane-based 
chemotherapy regimens [8]. Recently, poly ADP ribose polymerase in-
hibitors (PARPi) have been studied in patients with a pathogenic variant 
in homologous recombination genes other than BRCA. However, TP53 is 
not involved in the homologous recombination path, thus germline TP53 
carriers were excluded from both the TBCRC-048 and the Talazoparib 
Beyond BRCA trial [85,86]. 

Survivorship 

Guidelines recommend that TP53 carriers should follow a dedicated 
cancer surveillance protocol [27,87,88]. Guidelines and recommenda-
tions for second primary cancer surveillance among adult female TP53 
carriers are summarized in Table 4. 

Current  guidelines  agree  to  recommend  annual  breast  magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) (from age 20) for breast cancer surveillance, 
and  to  discuss  with  patients  the  possibility  to  undergo  risk-reducing 
mastectomy  [27,78,80,89–91,88,87,92].  On  the  contrary,  there  is  no 
consensus on the use of mammography, only routinely recommended by 
the NCCN guidelines and by the TORONTO protocol, [80,89] or in case

the  MRI  could  not  be  performed  also  taking  into  consideration  that 
microcalcification are not optimally detected by MRI. 

Considering the high risk of developing other tumors correlated with 
the  presence  of  a  germline  TP53  pathogenic  variant,  especially  brain 
malignancies,  soft  tissue  and  bone  sarcoma,  melanoma,  and  the 
increased rate of gastrointestinal cancer, all guidelines agree to recom-
mend annual whole-body MRI (generally from the age of 20) and annual 
brain  MRI.  Overall,  there  is  agreement  among  guidelines  that  MRI 
should  be  preferred  for  secondary  prevention  over  radiation-guided 
imaging.  Conversely,  there  is  no  consensus  whether  or  not  to  offer 
endoscopy  surveillance  of  the  upper  and  lower  gastrointestinal  tract: 
most guidelines suggest to tailor the indication and timing according to 
the family history. Many trials are currently ongoing with the aim of 
determine  diagnostic  efficacy  of  different  surveillance  imaging  tech-
niques  and  protocols  among  patients  with  TP53  pathogenic  variants 
(NCT03176836, NCT01464086, NCT02950987). 

In summary, according to guidelines, surveillance for breast cancer 
should be based on annual breast MRI starting at the age of 20 and risk- 
reducing surgery should be discussed with the patients (Fig. 1). For brain 
tumors and sarcoma, annual whole-body MRI should be performed since 
birth while gastrointestinal and melanoma secondary prevention should 
be considered in adulthood (Fig. 2). 

Regular follow up of patients with breast cancer should be scheduled 
based on current guidelines, considering not only the type of tumor, its 
biology and the treatment received, but also minimizing the diagnostic 
radiation  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  radiation-induced  secondary 
malignancies in these patients. Contrast-free diffusion-weighted whole- 
body MRI has proved to be effective for staging and follow-up in patients 
with breast cancer [89,93–96]. 

Finally, although limited evidence exist on the topic, all TP53 car-
riers should be made aware of their risk of malignancy and the possible 
symptoms as well as encouraged to make positive lifestyle choices (e.g., 
not smoking, limit alcohol and red meat consumption, high fruits and 
vegetables  intake,  physical  exercise,  sun  protection).  An  analysis  of 
lifestyle factors and health behavior among TP53 carriers suggested that 
women  with  a  TP53  carriers  have  healthier  diet  and  smoked  less 
compared  to  their  relatives  although  no  difference  was  observed  in 
physical activity [97]. 

Other components of survivorship care in TP53 carriers should be 
acknowledged.  Survivorship  trajectory of  cancer  patients is  made  not 
only by surveillance of recurrence and second primary malignancies but 
also  by  dealing  with  physical  effects  of  cancer  and  chronic  medical 
conditions, psychological effects and its social, work and financial im-
plications [98].

found,  mosaicism  and  clonal  hematopoiesis  should  be  considered. 
Pathogenic variants are assumed to be of germline origin when the allele 
frequency  is  approximately  50%;  however,  low  variant  allele  fre-
quencies (i.e., < 25–35%) might be found in a genetic report. In this 
case,  minor  allele  frequency  pathogenic  variant  is  the  result  of  a 

mutational  event  happened  at  a  post-zygotic  stage  thus  only  tissues 
derived from the mutated cell will carry the pathogenic variant [99]. If 
the mutation is restricted to the hematopoietic compartment, it is called 
clonal hematopoiesis. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that the 
prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis increases with age and that clonal 

CancerTreatmentReviews114(2023)1025227E. Blondeaux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

hematopoiesis  can  be  found  in  a  significant  portion  of  the  healthy 
population [100–103]. Clonal hematopoiesis has most frequently been 
reported with TP53 gene compared to other breast cancer susceptibility 
gene  [99].  Thus,  in  case  of  detection  of  minor  allele  frequency  TP53 
pathogenic variant the possibility of mosaicism should be ruled out as in 
this case different therapeutic and genetic counselling needs are impli-
cated [99]. 

Identification of a TP53 pathogenic variant does not always translate 
into the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The different pathogenic 
variants can have different penetrance and thus different phenotypes. A 
pathogenic  variant  with  reduced  penetrance  will  possibly  lead  to  an 
older age of occurrence of cancers of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome spec-
trum. For example, the funder mutation p.R181C in the TP53 gene was 
found among 9 out of 453 Palestinian young women with breast cancer. 
None of the families that harbored the TP53 p.R181C likely pathogenic 
variant  fulfilled  the  clinical  criteria  for  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome[104]. 
Similarly, the penetrance of the p.R337H TP53 pathogenic variant seem 
to be incomplete. In Southern Brazil, the population prevalence of TP53 
p.R337H pathogenic variant is 0.3%. In the Brazilian population, this 
variant seems to be associated with adrenocortical tumors in children 
but  not  with  other  cancers  typical  of  the  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome 
[105–107]. 

Understanding the factors that lead to phenotypic differences among 
TP53 carries is important to tailor the surveillance program and coun-
selling.  The  classification  of  the  Li-Fraumeni  spectrum  suggested  by 
Kratz and colleagues seem to be a valid approach to classify the different 
phenotypic spectrums of TP53 variants [108]. Authors classified germ-
line TP53 variants of 3034 persons into: phenotypic Li-Fraumeni syn-
drome (i.e., absence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in 
person  meeting  clinical  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  criteria),  Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome  (i.e,  presence  of  a  pathogenic/likely  pathogenic  TP53 
variant  in  person  meeting  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  testing  criteria), 
attenuated Li-Fraumeni syndrome (i.e., presence of a pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic TP53 variant in a person with cancer who does not meet Li- 
Fraumeni syndrome testing criteria), incidental Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
(i.e, presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant in a person 
without a history of cancer). Results showed that patients who met Li- 
Fraumeni syndrome genetic testing criteria have more frequently early 
adrenal, brain, connective tissue, or bone tumors. While carriers who did 
not meet Li-Fraumeni syndrome genetic testing criteria had more breast 
and other cancers (45% of them occurring after age 45 years) [108]. 

Identification  of  germline  TP53  pathogenic  variants  in  a  breast 
cancer individual triggers cascade genetic testing of relatives (including 
children)  for  early  diagnosis  through  increased  surveillance  and  pre-
vention. As the information regarding the identification of a pathogenic 
variant in the family relies in proband (proband-mediated procedure), it 
is uncertain whether all eligible relatives access testing. To our knowl-
edge,  no  results  on  the  uptake  of  TP53  testing  among  at-risk  family 
members are available. Moreover, testing of asymptomatic children at 
risk of Li Fraumeni syndrome remained controversial for a long time, 
due to the lack of proven medical benefit of screening, concern about 
informed  consent  and  potential  stigmatization  and  discrimination  to-
wards the minor [109]. However, due to emerging screening protocols 
showing potential efficacy, testing of at-risk children is becoming more 
widespread  in  those  institutions  where  access  to  whole-body  MRI  is 
available [89,94]. Nevertheless, future research should also focus on the 
long-term clinical and psychosocial impacts of TP53 genetic testing and 
early detection of such pathogenic variants in minors. 

Finally,  among  young  carriers  of  a  pathogenic  variant  in  breast 
cancer  susceptibly  genes,  further  burden  is  given  by  family  planning 
with  the  50%  risk  of  transmission  of  the  pathogenic  variant  to  the 
offspring. Thus, current guidelines recommend that TP53 carriers should 
be  offered  preimplantation  genetic  testing  (in  the  case  of  in  vitro 
fertilization)  or  prenatal  diagnosis  (in  case  of  natural  conception) 
[110,111].  However,  barriers  to  the  uptake  of  these  techniques  are 
similar  to  the  ones  faced  by  BRCA  carriers  and  include  the  lack  of 

availability  and  high  cost  of  the  procedure,  ethical  regulations  and 
burden of additional psychological distress [110]. To our knowledge, no 
information is available regarding awareness, acceptance, and uptake of 
preimplantation  genetic  testing  and  prenatal  testing  among  TP53 
carriers. 

Conclusions 

In  patients  with  breast  cancer,  the  prevalence  of  patients  with 
germline pathogenic variants in TP53 ranges from <0.5% in unselected 
patients with breast cancer to around 5–10% in highly selected patients 
with breast cancer such as those with very young age at diagnosis or 
with  strong  family history.  Regarding locoregional treatment,  current 
guidelines recommend  that radiotherapy should be avoided and mas-
tectomy should be preferred to lumpectomy [27,78,79]. Moreover, risk- 
reducing  contralateral  mastectomy  should  be  discussed,  and  annual 
breast  MRI  screening  is  recommended  as  secondary  prevention 
[27,78,79]. Whole-body MRI should be used for secondary cancer sur-
veillance. No information is available regarding potential differences in 
treatment  efficacy  and  indications  among  TP53  carriers.  Considering 
their  potential  worse  breast  cancer  prognosis  and  risk  of  developing 
secondary  malignancies,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  signs  or 
symptoms suggesting the occurrence of these events. 

The identification of a TP53 pathogenic variant is not a straightfor-
ward to the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome as different penetrance 
and phenotypes are present. No information on the uptake of cascade 
testing  to  at-risk  family  individuals  is  available  and  limited  evidence 
exist on the implication of genetic testing in minors. Current guidelines 
recommend  that  preimplantation  genetic  testing  and  prenatal  testing 
should be offered to patients willing to conceive [110,111]. Finally, the 
identification of a minor allele frequency of pathogenic variant needs 
further  evaluations  to  rule  out  the  possibility  of  mosaicism  that  can 
affect both cascade testing and preimplantation and prenatal testing. 

Considering the limited data available to counsel patients with breast 
cancer and germline TP53 pathogenic variants, the low level of evidence 
on some of the topic presented, the relatively rarity of this condition, and 
the  interpretation  of  TP53  found  in  the  blood  for  other  reason  (e.g. 
clonal hematopoiesis and mosaicism), collaborative research efforts are 
strongly encouraged in order to provide more solid answers to improve 
and better tailor the care of this special patient population.
