TIGAR downregulation in breast carcinoma cells reduces tumor growth. TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma cells drives MCT4 expression and NFkB activation in fibroblasts. IL6 and TGFB drive TIGAR upregulation in carcinoma cells, reduce CAV1 and increase MCT4 expression in fibroblasts. Tumor growth is abrogated in the presence of MCT4 knockout fibroblasts and environment. We discovered coregulation of c-MYC and TIGAR in carcinoma cells driven by lactate. Metabolic coupling primes the tumor microenvironment allowing for production, uptake and utilization of lactate. In sum, aggressive breast cancer is dependent on metabolic coupling.

Breast cancer is composed of metabolically coupled cellular compartments with upregulation of TIGAR in carcinoma cells and loss of CAV1 and upregulation of MCT4 in fibroblasts. The mechanisms that drive this metabolic coupling remain poorly characterized, however. Here, the authors show that TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells is required to promote tumor growth, which is dependent on the reprogramming of fibroblasts toward upregulation of MCT4 expression and lactate release. Co-regulation of TIGAR, c-MYC and lactate occurs in a carcinoma-cell autonomous fashion, while co-regulation of TIGAR, NFkB, TGFB and MCT4 unfolds in a paracrine fashion. 1 | I N T RO DU CT I O N Metabolic heterogeneity, or the “Reverse Warburg Effect”, defined as high glycolysis in stromal cells and high OXPHOS in cancer cells, involves an interplay between oncogenes, tumor suppressors, growth factors and cytokines, ultimately promoting cancer aggressiveness.1-12 High-energy metabolites, such as lactate, can be transferred from glycolytic fibroblasts to carcinoma cells fueling OXPHOS.13 To date, the steps in glycolysis, which include glucose uptake, PFK1 and HK activity,8,14,16,19 but the underlying mechanisms remain uncharacterized. TIGAR is highly expressed in many cancer types, driving proliferation, migration, invasion, crosstalk with NFkB and tumor burden.20-25 TIGAR drives breast cancer tumor growth with glycolysis in fibroblasts and utilization of lactate to fuel OXPHOS and ATP production in carcinoma cells.8 Together these studies demonstrate TIGAR expression drives cancer progression and aggressiveness, but the mechanisms mechanisms driving metabolic heterogeneity have not been well remain poorly characterized. characterized. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanisms of crossTP53 Induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator (TIGAR) induces talk by which TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells induces metabolic metabolic heterogeneity in breast cancer models with increased mitoheterogeneity and whether carcinoma TIGAR and reciprocal changes chondrial OXPHOS in carcinoma cells and increased glycolysis in fibroblasts.8 TIGAR is a P53 target gene,14 but its expression is not exclusively dependent on wild-type p53.14 TIGAR functions as a bisphoin fibroblasts are necessary for aggressive breast cancer. We determined that TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells is required to promote tumor growth, which is dependent upon reprogramming sphatase and shares similarity with the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/frucfibroblasts to upregulate MCT4 and lactate release. We discovered a in the bisphosphatase tose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB) enzymes domain.15 TIGAR and PFKFB regulate glycolysis via modulation of Fru-2,6-P2, reducing the affinity of PFK1 for Fru-6-P maintaining ATP-mediated inhibition, regulating PFK1 activity.15 PFK1 activity, hexokinase activity, glucose import and lactate export are the four ratelimiting steps in glycolytic flux.16 Reducing PFK1 activity decreases glycolysis.14,17 TIGAR expression was inversely related to 2-deoxyglucose uptake using 18-Fluoro 2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography.18 These results validate that TIGAR reduces glycolytic flux. Also, TIGAR binds to and regulates the activity of mitochondrial bound (HKII).16,19 In sum, TIGAR targets three rate-limiting hexokinase II novel coregulation of c-MYC and TIGAR in carcinoma cells. 2 | M A T E R I A L S A N D M ET H O D S 2.1 | TIGAR expression in human samples First, a GEO (search was performed to identify datasets with published transcriptome-level gene expression data in healthy tissues, using the keywords “gene expression”, “normal” and “GPL96” and “GPL570.” A gene 10970215, 2023, 9, Downloaded from Wiley Online Library on [22/10/2025].

A representative image from each condition is shown of MCT4 in fibroblasts on tumor growth, we co-injected AT-3 or PY8119 cells with MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) or WT MEFs into MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) or WT mice.

Since c-MYC is the main tranaddition of acetate in TIGAR KD cells leads to restoration of c-MYC scription factor that drives MCT1 expression allowing for lactate influx,33 we wanted to determine the effect of lactate exposure on c-MYC expression in breast carcinoma cells. c-MYC expression was levels (Figure 5I). Lactylation is a novel epigenetic reprogramming element where the lactyl group from lactate is added to lysine residues of histones and regulates gene expression.36 Since TIGAR and c-MYC increased in MCF7 after 5 mM lactate treatment (Figure 5B). Since expression are regulated by lactate we wanted to evaluate the levels lactate increases both TIGAR and c-MYC expression in breast carciof lactylation in breast carcinoma cells. TIGAR knockdown cells with noma cells, we wanted to evaluate the relationship between c-MYC reduced c-MYC expression were evaluated for lactylation levels by and TIGAR expression to determine if TIGAR and c-MYC regulate immunoblot and TIGAR knockdown cells have modestly reduced laceach other. c-MYC expression in TIGAR knockdown cells is reduced tylation after 0 to 10 mM lactate treatment compared with controls compared with control cells (Figure 5C). c-MYC expression was then and lactylation levels increase with lactate (Figure 5J). TIGAR overexevaluated by immunoblot in MCF7 and AT-3 EV or TIGAR overexpressing cells were evaluated for lactylation levels by immunoblot and pressing carcinoma cells which demonstrated that increased TIGAR TIGAR overexpressing cells have increased lactylation levels after 0 to expression increased c-MYC expression (Figure 5D). These data sug10 mM lactate treatment (Figure 5K). We also evaluated the effect of gest that TIGAR expression can regulate c-MYC expression in breast TIGAR overexpression with the addition of 0 to 10 mM lactate on carcinoma cells. We next wanted to determine if the expression of H3K9 acetylation levels. TIGAR overexpressing cells have increased c-MYC can modulate TIGAR expression. MCF7 cells with Sg control H3K9 acetylation levels, which can be seen at baseline and after addior Sg c-MYC KD cells were evaluated for TIGAR expression and tion of lactate (Figure S6A, B). Taken together, these data suggest that MCF7 c-MYC KD cells have reduced TIGAR expression (Figure 5E). there is a direct relationship between TIGAR and c-MYC expression in These data suggest that c-MYC and TIGAR regulate each other. breast carcinoma cells. c-MYC by acting as a transcription factor that recognizes a DNA response element (CANNTG) in the promoter of genes directly regulates gene expression. We evaluated the TIGAR promoter sequence and found two E-box elements that c-MYC could bind to and directly regulate TIGAR expression. To determine if c-MYC could be binding | TIGAR induced tumor growth is dependent 3.7 on metabolic reprogramming to the TIGAR promoter, we generated a luciferase construct containWe wanted to evaluate the interaction between carcinoma TIGAR ing the TIGAR promoter sequence with both E-Boxes upstream of the and fibroblast MCT4 on tumor growth since TIGAR drives tumor luciferase gene. This construct was expressed in LV control or c-MYC overexpressing AT-3 or PY8119 cells (Figure 5F). Cells were treated with 5 mM lactate to enhance c-MYC expression. The TIGAR promoter luciferase activity was increased 1.5- and 3.0-fold in AT-3 and growth, MCT4 expression in fibroblasts drives lactate release, and lactate induces carcinoma TIGAR expression.8 PY8119 EV or PY8119 TIGAR overexpressing cells were coinjected with WT or MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs into the flank of WT or MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice. PY8119 PY8119 c-MYC overexpressing cells (P < .05; Figure 5G). We also TIGAR overexpressing cells coinjected with WT MEFs in WT mice generated a mutant TIGAR promoter luciferase construct where generated 4.8- and 2.1-fold lager tumors by weight and volume comTIGAR promoter sequence with both E-Boxes mutated is upstream of pared with tumors generated with coinjection of PY8119 EV cells the luciferase gene. We expressed the mutant TIGAR promoter luciferase construct in LV control or c-MYC overexpressing AT-3 cells. (P < .05; Figure 6A, B). Coinjection of PY8119 TIGAR overexpressing cells with MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs into MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice were no longer able The mutant TIGAR promoter luciferase activity was reduced 1.5-fold to generate larger tumors compared with PY8119 EV coinjection in AT-3 c-MYC overexpressing cells (P < .05; Figure 5H). These data tumors (P > .05; Figure 6A, B). Therefore, these data demonstrate suggest that c-MYC could be binding directly to the TIGAR promoter that TIGAR's ability to induce larger tumor size is dependent upon driving TIGAR expression. Next, we wanted to evaluate the role of fibroblast MCT4. TIGAR driving c-MYC expression via acetylation since c-MYC expression can be regulated by acetylation and epigenetic reprogramming.34 TIGAR overexpressing cells increase mitochondrial metabolism8 and presumably TCA cycle flux with increased acetyl-CoA, which can be Tumors were excised and tumor microtissues were generated and subjected to a mitochondrial stress test where oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured at baseline, after injection of 1.5 μM oligomycin, 2.0 μM FCCP and 0.5 μM Rotenone/Antimycin A. Oligomycin utilized to acetylate histones with low TIGAR having the opposite is a complex V inhibitor that is used to determine ATP-linked OCR effects. Previous studies demonstrated that TIGAR expression is able to drive gene expression via H3K9 acetylation.35 c-MYC expression can be driven by acetylation of H3K9 at its promoter region.32 Thereand proton leak, FCCP is an ionophore which inhibits ATP synthase and is used to calculate the maximal respiratory capacity, and Rotenone and Antimycin A are complex I and complex III inhibitors that fore, H3K9 acetylation levels in TIGAR KD cells was evaluated by are used to inhibit the electron transport chain to calculate nonimmunoblot analysis under control conditions and after addition of mitochondrial OCR. 2.5 mM acetate.

(C) Model of effects of TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells. TIGAR in carcinoma cells positively modulates the expression c-MYC in a cell autonomous fashion and modulates the expression of fibroblast MCT4 and CAV1. Conversely, fibroblast MCT4 and CAV1 expression modulates the expression of TIGAR in carcinoma cells. This cross-talk is mediated by the production of the soluble factors TGFB, IL6 and lactate.

To determine if the reduced OCR in PY8119 TIGAR tumors generated with MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) is dependent upon lactate and MCT4 in fibroblasts. Tumors generated with PY8119 TIGAR cells and MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs in MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice cannot increase OCR upon exposure to lactate suggesting that there 10970215, 2023, 9, Downloaded from Wiley Online Library on [22/10/2025].

PY8119 TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells were coinjected with MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs into MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice. Mice We determined the mechanisms of crosstalk between carcinoma cells overexpressing TIGAR and fibroblasts that induces metabolic were treated with systemic lactate (500 mg/kg) or vehicle control by heterogeneity.

PY8119 TIGAR tumors generated with MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs in MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice and treated with lacmatory environment, promoting fibroblast NFkB activation and production of the cytokines IL6 and TGFB2. This leads to the tate were not statistically different by tumor volume or weight upregulation of MCT4 and downregulation of CAV1 in fibroblasts, as (P > .05; Figure S7A).

The blood lactate concentration in the MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice treated with lactate was 2.1-fold greater than vehicle control MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice (P < .05; Figure S7B). To evaluate if exogenous lactate treatment has any effect on TIGAR mediated tumor The current study demonstrates that the induction of metabolic heterogeneity between carcinoma cells and fibroblasts is a mechanism by which TIGAR induces from MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice have reduced glycolysis. Coculture of carcinoma cells tumor aggressiveness. MEFs growth in the WT background, PY8119 TIGAR overexpressing cells with MCT4 KD fibroblasts reduces TIGAR expression (Figure S8A). were coinjected with WT MEFs into WT mice and treated with systemic lactate (500 mg/kg) or vehicle control by IP injection daily until tumor excision. PY8119 TIGAR tumors generated with WT MEFs in Coculture of carcinoma cells with MCT4 KD fibroblasts reduces carcinoma TIGAR expression. MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) MEFs co-injected with carcinoma cells in MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) mice have reduced tumor growth compared with WT mice and treated with lactate generated 3.2- and 1.6-fold lager carcinoma cells co-injected with WT MEFs in WT mice. These data tumors by weight and volume (P < .05; Figure S7C). The blood lactate suggest that MCT4 mediated transfer high-energy metabolites, such concentration of the WT mice was measured after IP injection. The as lactate, from glycolytic fibroblasts to carcinoma cells fueling blood lactate concentration in the WT mice treated with lactate was OXPHOS is important for tumor growth. Carcinoma cells cocultured 2.0-fold greater than vehicle control treated WT mice (P < .05; with fibroblasts also have increased expression of the lactate importer Figure S7D). Finally, knockdown for MCT4 in BJ1 fibroblasts reduces expression of TIGAR in MCF7 carcinoma cells separated by an insert (Figure S8A). These data suggest that there is metabolic reprogramming occurring in the tumors that allows TIGAR overexpressing tumors to uptake and utilize lactate in WT conditions to promote tumor growth. In MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) conditions, the metabolism of the tumors is reprogrammed in a way that abolishes TIGAR's ability to uptake and utilize lactate, preventing TIGAR mediated tumor growth. We also determined that exogenous lactate treatment is not sufficient to rescue TIGAR mediated tumor growth in an MCT4(cid:1)/(cid:1) background. MCT1, which allows for OXPHOS.40 the uptake of lactate that can fuel Lactate induces cancer aggressiveness,31 accompanied by TIGAR upregulation.8 We studied the role of lactate and TIGAR on c-MYC expression, the main transcription factor that drives MCT1 expression for import into carcinoma cells, mitochondrial metabolism, and biogenesis.12,33,41 We observed that lactate upregulates c-MYC expression in carcinoma cells, a feature of aggressive breast cancer.42,43 Here, we discovered a novel coregulation of c-MYC and TIGAR, Taken together, these data demonstrate that lactate in the TME is suggesting that c-MYC may be directly regulating TIGAR expression required for TIGAR mediated tumor growth and that TIGAR induces via binding to the TIGAR promoter. Additionally, TIGAR may be regumetabolic priming in the TME, which allows for the production, lating c-MYC by epigenetic reprogramming.
