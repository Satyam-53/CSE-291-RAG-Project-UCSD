Abstract
TP53 mutation (TP53-mut) correlates with inferior survival in many cancers, whereas its prognostic role in diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is still in controversy. Therefore, more precise risk stratification needs to be further 
explored for TP53-mut DLBCL patients. A set of 2637 DLBCL cases from multiple cohorts, was enrolled in our 
analysis. Among the 2637 DLBCL patients, 14.0% patients (370/2637) had TP53-mut. Since missense mutations 
account for the vast majority of TP53-mut DLBCL patients, and most non-missense mutations affect the function 
of the P53 protein, leading to worse survival rates, we distinguished patients with missense mutations. A TP53 
missense mutation risk model was constructed based on a 150-combination machine learning computational 
framework, demonstrating excellent performance in predicting prognosis. Further analysis revealed that patients 
with high-risk missense mutations are significantly associated with early progression and exhibit dysregulation of 
multiple immune and metabolic pathways at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the high-risk group showed 
an absolutely suppressed immune microenvironment. To stratify the entire cohort of TP53-mut DLBCL, we 
combined clinical characteristics and ultimately constructed the TP53 Prognostic Index (TP53PI) model. In summary, 
we identified the truly high-risk TP53-mut DLBCL patients and explained this difference at the mutation and 
transcriptional levels.

Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most com-
mon  lymphoid  malignancy  and  characterized  by  pro-
nounced genetic and clinical heterogeneity [1]. According 
to  the  cell-of-origin  (COO)  classification  based  on  gene 
expression  profiling,  this  disease  can  be  classified  into 
activated  B-cell-like  (ABC),  germinal  center  B-cell-like 
(GCB),  and  unclassified  (UNC)  subtypes  [2].  However, 
the COO classification has not been satisfied for clinical 
prognosis  and  targeted  therapy  in  clinically  [3–7].  With 
the  development  of  next-generation  gene  sequencing 
(NGS)  technology,  Staudt  et  al.  had  developed  Lymph-
Gen  genetic  subtype  classifier  for  DLBCL  [8].  DLBCL 
can  be  divided  into  seven  gene-subtypes  with  different 
prognosis  and  corresponding  potential  targeted  therapy 
drugs.

TP53  mutations  correlate  with  inferior  survivals  in 
many  cancers  including  lymphomas  [9–14].  TP53  is  the 
most frequently mutated gene in DLBCL enriched in A53 
subtype and also could be found in other gene subtypes 
[8,  15].  However,  A53  subtype  which  has  fatal  prognos-
tic  cannot  be  identified  using  NGS  technology  which 
was  used  mostly  in  clinical  practice.  Therefore,  detailed 
prognosis  should  be  determined  for  TP53  mutations  in 
DLBCL  in  order  to  provide  a  more  accurate  prognosis. 
Hong  Y  et  al.  found  that  TP53  mutations  correlate  with 
inferior  overall  survival  (OS)  and  progression-free  sur-
vival (PFS) in DLBCL patients [11]. Despite the fact that 
they showed a statistically significant difference between 
the  two  groups,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  two  curves  are 
substantially  close  to  one  another.  It  has  also  been  our 
experience  in  clinical  practice  that  not  all  patients  with 
TP53  mutations  have  a  poor  prognosis.  All  these  phe-
nomenon leads us to speculate that whether more precise 
risk  stratification  for  TP53  mutant  (TP53-mut)  DLBCL 
patients  can  be  investigated  using  clinical  and  genetic 
characteristics.  In  the  present  study,  we  aim  to  develop 
the prognostic index (PI) to identify truly high-risk TP53-
mut DLBCL patients and elucidate the potential underly-
ing mechanisms of different prognosis.

Methods and materials
Study group
Public database resources

The  available  clinical 
information  and  correspond-
ing  mutation  data  of  B  cell  lymphoma  patients  were 
retrieved  and  obtained  from  published  articles.  Non-
DLBCL patients were excluded. Ultimately, 2637 DLBCL 
patients in six cohorts were enrolled in the final analysis, 
including Lacy S et al. cohort [15, 16] (N = 839), Reddy A 
et  al.  cohort  [17]  (N = 1001),  Dubois  S  et  al.  cohort  [18] 
(N = 361),  Pedrosa  L  et  al.  cohort  19  (N = 84),  Chapuy  B 
et al. cohort [1] (N = 304) and The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA,  https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)  cohort  (N = 48) 

(Fig. 1). Cancer cell lines containing 21 DLBCL cell lines 
mutation  and  RNA  sequencing  (RNA-seq)  data  (Cancer 
Cell  Line  Encyclopedia,  CCLE)  were  downloaded  from 
the Broad Institute DepMap Portal (https://depmap.org/
portal/).

JSPH cohort

Our  study  cohort  consists  of  108  patients  with  DLBCL 
according  to  the  World  Health  Organization  classifica-
tion criteria between 2022 and 2023 in the First Affiliated 
Hospital  of  Nanjing  Medical  University  (Jiangsu  Prov-
ince  Hospital,  JSPH).  Among  the  108  DLBCL  patients, 
all tumor tissue samples were collected to perform NGS, 
while  a  total  of  103  DLBCL  samples  were  analyzed  the 
gene expression levels using RNA-seq.

(https://TP53.isbcgc.org/,  originally 

To  obtain  additional  information  regarding  the  muta-
tions  and  functions  of  TP53,  we  retrieved  the  TP53 
database 
IARC 
database)  for  mutation  site  information.  For  the  analy-
sis,  we  selected  13  mutation-related  factors,  including 
exon, multi-locus mutation, with copy number variation 
(CNV),  splice  site  mutation,  Cytosine-phosphate-Gua-
nine (CpG) site mutation, nucleotide change, transition/
transversion,  hotspot  mutation,  structural  motif,  trans-
activation  class,  dominant-negative  effect  (DNE)_  loss-
of-function  (LOF)  class,  structure  function  class,  and 
variant  allele  frequency  (VAF).  Pay  particular  attention 
to the following detail, which the hotspot mutations are 
pan-cancer hotspot mutations identified by Chang et al. 
[20], and are not DLBCL-specific hotspot mutations.

Patient characteristics

In  enrolled  patients  from  the  6  public  databases,  it  was 
possible  to  retrieve  all  or  part  of  the  clinical  data.  The 
clinical characteristics, including age, gender, Ann Arbor 
stage,  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG), 
No.  of  extranodal  involvement,  serum  lactate  dehydro-
genase (LDH) level, International Prognostic Index (IPI), 
cell  of  origin  (COO)  subtype,  LymphGen  genetic  sub-
type, treatment response and PFS or OS.

Construction of model by integrative machine learning 
approaches

The  whole  dataset  was  randomly  divided  into  a  train-
ing  set  and  a  testing  set  in  a  4:1  ratio,  ensuring  a  bal-
anced  distribution  of  clinical  characteristics  between 
the  two  groups.  A  total  of  ten  machine  learning  algo-
rithms  were  employed,  including  Lasso,  Ridge,  stepwise 
Cox, CoxBoost, random survival forest (RSF), elastic net 
(Enet), partial least squares regression for Cox (plsRcox), 
supervised  principal  components  (SuperPC),  general-
ized  boosted  regression  modeling  (GBM),  and  survival 
support vector machine (survival-SVM). On the basis of 
a  tenfold  cross-validation  framework,  we  arranged  150

combinations of these 10 algorithms in the training data-
set for the purpose of variable selection and the construc-
tion of models. For each model, we calculated its C index 
both the training and the testing sets. We then ranked the 
models according to their predictive performance based 
on  the  mean  C  index.  We  selected  a  combination  of 
algorithms  with  both  robust  performance  and  clinically 
translational significance. We assessed the models preci-
sion discrimination and accuracy using receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC) curves, the C index, and cali-
bration curves.

Mutation analysis

Mutation  analysis  was  performed  with  genomic  DNA 
extracted  from  tumor  tissue  samples  in  all  DLBCL 
patients  of  JSPH  cohort  using  clinically  validated  NGS 
mutation panels.

Library construction

Libraries  were  constructed  by  using  the  KAPA  Hyper 
DNA  Library  Prep  Kit  (KAPA  Biosystem,  KK8504)  and 
dual-indexed  sequencing  libraries  were  generated  and 

cleaned  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  amplifi-
cations  with  KAPA  HiFi  Hot  start-ready  Mix  (KAPA, 
KK2602) and purification Beads (Corning, AxyPrep Frag-
ment Select-I kit, 14223162), respectively.

NGS

As the capture probes, our panels covered 475 leukemia- 
and  lymphoma-related  genes  (Table  S1).  1  µg  of  each 
fragment  was  mixed  with  5  µg  of  salmon  sperm  DNA, 
5  µg  of  human  Cot-1  DNA  and  1  unit  adaptor-specific 
blocker  DNA  in  hybridization  buffer  and  heated  for 
10 min at 95℃ and held for 5 min at 65℃ in the thermo-
cycler. Following adding capture probes, the mixture was 
rest for 5 min and then heated to 65℃ for 16–18 h. The 
captured targets were separated by pulling down the bio-
tinylated  probe/target  hybrids  using  streptavidin-coated 
magnetic  beads,  and  the  off-target  library  was  removed 
by a washing buffer after hybridization. We amplified the 
captured  library  from  the  washed  beads  for  6‒8  cycles, 
purified  the  products  by  AMPure  XP  beads  and  sized 
them  on  bioanalyzer  2100  (Agilent,  Agilent  HS  DNA 
Reagent,  5067–4627).  The  concentration  and  quality  of

target enriched sequencing libraries were tested by Qubit 
(Invitrogen). Finally, the libraries were loaded on Illumina 
HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer’s instrument.
‘G3viz’  is  an  R  package  to  visualize  location  and  fre-
quency of mutations in TP53 [21]. The R package ‘Com-
plexHeatmap’ was used to analyze the mutated genes in 
TP53-mut DLBCL [22].

RNA sequencing
Library construction

Total  RNA  was  isolated  using  TRIzol  RNA  Isolation 
method  (Invitrogen).  Ribosomal  RNA  was  eliminated 
by  RNase  H  and  the  sequencing  library  was  prepared 
by KAPA Stranded RNA-seq Kit with RiboErase (HMR) 
(KAPA  Biosystems).  Library  was  sequenced  by  Illumina 
HiSeq NGS platforms (Illumina), following concentration 
measurements and regular quality assessments.

Gene expression analysis

To generate sequence reads, base calling was performed 
with  bcl2fastq  v2.19.0.316  (Illumina)  following  quality 
control  (QC)  analysis  of  sequence  reads  to  determine 
if  the  sequencing  data  is  suitable  for  subsequent  analy-
sis  [23].  R  packages  ‘DESeq2’  and  ‘limma’  were  used  to 
analyze  differential  expression  in  patients  and  cell  lines, 
respectively [24, 25]. We selected differentially expressed 
genes  (DEGs)  with  P-values  0.05  and  fold-changes > 1.0 
as  significant  and  used  them  in  our  analysis.  Gene  Set 
Enrichment  Analysis  (GSEA)  was  performed  to  deci-
pher  the  meaningful  signaling  pathways  and  biologi-
cal  processes  in  the  enrichment  analysis  of  differentially 
expressed  genes  [26].  Gene  Ontology  (GO)  and  Kyoto 
Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG)  annota-
tion  was  performed  with  the  R  package  ‘clusterProfiler’ 
to  further  elucidate  the  biological  role  of  DEGs  [27]. 
The  ‘oncoPredict’  R  package  was  used  to  predict  the 
half-maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  values  in 
patients in the different risk groups [28].

Determination of immune cell infiltration

To estimate the scores for immune cell types in the tumor 
microenvironment,  single-sample  gene  set  enrichment 
analysis  (ssGSEA)  was  used.  Based  on  gene  expression 
levels  in  a  single  sample,  enrichment  scores  are  calcu-
lated,  and  these  scores  are  then  normalized  [29].  Then, 
enrichment score of inflammatory cytokines and immune 
checkpoints  (ICPs)  was  calculated  using  ssGSEA.  Table 
S2 summarizes the genesets applied.

Statistical analysis

All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  with  SPSS  sta-
tistics version 20.0, GraphPad Prism version 7.0 statisti-
cal  software  and  R  software  (Version  4.1.3).  Unpaired 
Students’  t-tests  were  used  for  comparing  normally 

distributed  variables.  The  correlation  analysis  was  actu-
alized by Spearman’s correlation test. The Kaplan–Meier 
method  and  Log-Rank  or  Breslow  tests  were  used  for 
survival  analysis.  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression 
models  were  used  for  univariate  and  multivariable  anal-
ysis.  The  forest  plot  was  utilized  to  visualize  the  results 
of  univariate  and  multivariate  Cox  regression  analyses. 
P < 0.05  was  considered  statistically  significant.  Graphs 
were  made  with  GraphPad  Prism  7,  the  “ggplot2”  and 
“ComplexHeatmap” R package.

Results
Mutation profile and prognostic impacts of TP53 mutations 
in DLBCL

Among  the  2637  DLBCL  patients  from  the  integrated 
cohort,  2267  patients  (86.0%)  were  TP53  wild-type 
(TP53-wt)  while  TP53  mutations  were  found  in  370 
patients  with  a  14.0%  mutation  rate,  including  305  with 
missense  mutations,  32  with  nonsense  mutations,  26 
with  multiple  mutations,  25  with  frameshift  mutations, 
16  with  splicing  site  mutations,  5  with  intronic  muta-
tions, 3 with in frame mutations, 3 with loss of stop and 
1  with  start  lost  (Fig.  2A).  The  distribution  of  mutation 
events  detected  in  the  370  patients  were  mainly  located 
in  the  DNA  binding  domain  (DBD)  (N = 333,  90.0%), 
containing  34  at  Arg248,  20  at  Gly245,  20  at  Arg273, 
18  at  Arg175,  12  at  Arg282,  corresponding  to  the  TP53 
hotspots  in  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  described  in  pre-
vious  studies  [11,  30]  (Fig.  2B).  In  the  structural  motif 
corresponding  to  the  domain  functional  region,  36%  of 
mutations  have  been  located  in  the  L2/L3,  35%  in  the 
NDBL/beta-sheets,  and  21%  in  the  L1/S/H2  (Fig.  2C). 
In the integrated cohort, TP53 mutations were detected 
scattered throughout exon 2 to exon 11, with 35% in exon 
7, 21% in exon 5,19% in exon 8, 15% in exon 6, 5% in exon 
4 and 5% in other exons (Fig. 2E). TP53 mutations were 
predominated by C > T (N = 125, 35%) and G > A (N = 66, 
18%) transitions, and the overall transition rate was 70% 
with the transition/transversion ratio of 2.3 (Fig. 2F).

M.  Staudt  and  colleagues  identified  seven  genetic 
subgroups  and  developed  the  LymphGen  algorithm, 
which  allows  a  precise  genetic  classification  for  DLBCL 
patients8.  We  acquired  the  LymphGen  genetic  subtype 
information from the supplement data of published arti-
cles, including Lacy S et al. cohort [15], Pedrosa L et al. 
cohort [19] and Chapuy B et al. cohort [1]. Furthermore, 
we  used  the  LymphGen  algorithm  web  tool  (https://
llmpp.nih.gov/lymphgen/index.php)  to  distinguish  the 
genetic  subtypes  for  Reddy  A  cohort  and  TCGA  cohort 
patients.  In  this  part  of  the  analysis,  Dubois  S  cohort 
was removed because of limited genes in the NGS panel. 
Most of the TP53-mut DLBCL patients in the integrated 
cohort can be classified into other subtype (58%) due to

missing the data of copy-number, followed by EZB (20%), 
MCD (4%), BN2 (7%), ST2 (7%) and N1(4%) (Fig. 2D).

The  clinical  parameters  between  the  TP53-mut  and 
TP53-wt groups in the integrated cohort are summarized 
in  Table  1.  Of  note,  there  is  a  significantly  higher  fre-
quency  of  elevated  LDH  levels  (P = 0.026)  and  older  age 
(P = 0.039) in TP53-mut patients. Compared with TP53-
wt patients, the TP53-mut patients were associated with 
significantly worse survivals of 2-year, 5-year and 10-year 
PFS  (61.5%  vs.  70.2%,  48.2%  vs.  60.4%,  33.7%  vs.  45.8%, 
P = 0.0001, Fig. 2G), which were similar to data in previ-
ous  research  [30].  In  terms  of  OS,  a  significant  P  value 
was generated (P < 0.0001, Fig. 2H).

However,  after  reviewing  clinical  course  of  patients 
with  TP53  mutation  in  our  center’s  cohort,  we  found 
that actually not all the TP53-mut patients acquired poor 
clinical outcomes. The different outcomes of such typical 
TP53-mut  patients  have  caught  our  attention.  Further-
more,  the  differences  of  2-year,  5-year  and  10-year  PFS 
and  OS  between  TP53-mut  and  TP53-wt  patients  were 
all less than 15% (Fig. 2G and H). Therefore, more precise 
stratification is worth investigating for TP53-mut DLBCL 
patients.

Identify genetic risk factors for TP53-mut DLBCL patients

The  above  findings  prompted  us  to  further  consider  if 
we  could  construct  a  model  to  identify  the  truly  high-
risk  TP53-mut  DLBCL  patients.  First,  we  retrieved  the 
TP53 database (https://TP53.isbcgc.org/ originally IARC 
database)  for  TP53  mutation  site  information  of  the  six 
cohorts  in  order  to  obtain  additional  information  about 
TP53  mutations  and  functions.  Based  on  all  the  infor-
mation  contained  in  the  TP53  database,  we  conducted 
survival  analysis,  and  Fig.  3  summarizes  some  impor-
tant  results.  Compared  with  patients  with  missense 
mutations,  patients  with  non-missense  mutations  have 
a  significantly  poorer  survival  (P = 0.0473,  Fig.  3A),  and 
patients  with  multi-site  mutations  also  have  a  signifi-
cantly  poorer  survival  (P = 0.0368,  Fig.  3D).  While  most 
mutations affecting P53 protein function result in loss of 
function, there are still 6.1% of notDNE_notLOF patients 
who  have  no  effect  on  P53  protein  function  and  have  a 
good  prognosis  (P = 0.0363,  Fig.  3B).  In  terms  of  struc-
ture function, the result is similar, with a statistical trend 
(P = 0.0855,  Fig.  3C).  Additionally,  mutations  at  splic-
ing sites (P = 0.1172, Fig. 3F) and non-hotspot mutations 
(P = 0.1175, Fig. 3G) had a poor prognosis, with a statis-
tical  trend.  Using  X-tile  for  the  optimal  cutoff,  variants 
with  VAF > 36%  were  considered  high  burden,  and  high 
VAF  was  associated  with  worse  prognosis  (P < 0.0001, 
Fig.  3H).  The  prognosis  of  these  missense  mutation 
patients  is  not  differentiated  according  to  whether  the 
mutation  occurs  within  the  DNA-binding  loops  or  not 
(Fig. 3E).

Since  missense  mutations  account  for  the  vast  major-
ity  of  TP53-mut  DLBCL  patients  (Fig.  2A  and  B)  and 
most  of  non-misense  mutations  can  affect  the  function 
of P53 protein which ultimately leads to worse survivals 
(Fig. 3A). Therefore, we attempted to further stratify mis-
sense mutation patients.

Construction of a prognosis signature for TP53 missense 
mutation DLBCL patients based on integrative machine 
learning

The dataset was divided into a training set and an inter-
nal testing set at a 4:1 ratio. In the training set, we fitted 
150  prediction  models  with  a  tenfold  cross-validation 
framework and computed the C index across all training 
and testing sets, the top 50 out of 150 kinds of prediction 
models  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  4A.  The  calibration  curves 
showed  good  agreement  between  the  top  3  prediction 
models  predictions  and  actual  observations  (Figure  S1A 
and  S1B).  Next,  we  followed  two  models  -  the  RSF  and 
the  Ridge + RSF,  both  of  which  demonstrated  good  pre-
dictive  abilities  in  both  training  and  testing  corhort. 
However,  Ridge + RSF  is  more  concise,  yet  equally  effec-
tive predictive model than RSF, which incorporates more 

factors. As a result of comprehensive screening, we iden-
tified Ridge + RSF as a predictive model.

Through  a  tenfold  cross-validation  framework,  we 
determined  that  0.285266  was  the  optimal  λ  value  in 
the  Ridge  analysis  by  minimizing  the  partial  likelihood 
deviation  (Fig.  4B  and  C).  Figure  4D  shows  the  impor-
tance  ranking  of  each  variable.  Further,  we  performed 
COX  multivariate  regression  analysis  on  these  impor-
tant  variables  and  selected  4  independent  prognostic 
variables  to  establish  the  TP53  missense  mutation  risk 
model  (Fig.  4E).  The  coefficients  for  each  variable  are 
shown  in  Fig.  4F.  The  C  index  demonstrates  the  stable 
and robust predictive ability of the TP53 missense muta-
tion risk model in both training and testing corhort (Fig-
ure S1C and S1D). The AUC of the model achieved 0.676 
and  0.663  in  training  and  testing  corhort,  respectively, 
indicating  its  predictive  accuracy  (Figure  S1E  and  S1F). 
In  order  to  divide  patients  with  TP53  missense  muta-
tions  into  low-risk  and  high-risk  groups,  we  selected 
a  risk  score  of  -0.34484,  which  is  close  to  50%,  as  the 
cutoff  value  for  dividing  patients  with  TP53  missense 
mutations.  Details  were  shown  in  Fig.  4G.  In  the  whole 
cohort and testing cohort, patients in the high-risk group

exhibited  significantly  worse  OS  than  those  in  the  low-
risk group (Fig. 4H and I).

Differences in clinical characteristics between the two risk 
groups of TP53 missense mutation

The  clinical  and  mutation  features  were  evaluated 
between  the  two  risk  groups  of  TP53  missense  muta-
tion  in  the  whole  cohort.  We  found  that  the  splice  site 

mutation,  transactivation  class,  DNE_LOF  class  and 
VAF  were  significantly  correlated  with  the  risk  groups, 
but  other  clinical  characteristics  except  POD12  did  not 
show  significant  differences  (Fig.  5A  and  S2).  And  we 
observed  significant  difference  in  the  distribution  of 
POD12 between the high- and low-risk groups (P = 0.009, 
Fig.  5B).  These  findings  suggested  that  high-risk  TP53

missense  mutation  patients  are  associated  with  early 
progression.

By  performing  Kaplan-Meier  curve  analysis,  we  also 
found  that  the  risk  model  demonstrated  a  robust  prog-
nostic  ability  for  TP53  missense  mutation  DLBCL 
patients  across  subgroups  stratified  by  various  clinical 
characteristics, including age and IPI (Fig. 5C–5G).

Biological mechanisms underlying different prognosis of 
TP53-mut DLBCL patients

To  elucidate  the  underlying  biological  mechanisms  in 
TP53-mut  DLBCL  and  subtypes,  we  performed  genetic 
mutation  landscape  analysis  by  somatic  mutation  data 
and  differential  expression  analysis  by  using  RNA-seq 
in  JSPH  cohort.  JSPH  cohort’s  clinical  parameters  were 
summarized in Table S3. Among them, 24 patients with 
TP53  missense  mutations  were  stratified  according  to 
the  above  TP53  missense  mutation  risk  model,  with  12 
patients at low risk and 12 patients at high risk.

Based on the stratification of the TP53 missense muta-
tion  risk  model,  the  oncoplot  indicated  that  CCND3 
mutants  were  significantly  more  prevalent  in  the  high-
risk  group  (Fig.  6A).  2498  DEGs  including  2079  down-
regulated  and  419  upregulated  genes  were  enriched  in 
high-risk  TP53  missense  mutation  DLBCL  (Fig.  6B). 
As  expected,  the  immune-associated  biological  pro-
cesses  occupied  a  large  proportion  in  the  result  of  GO 
functional  enrichment  analysis  (Fig.  6C).  The  KEGG 
enrichment  analysis  also  revealed  that  TP53  missense 
mutation high-risk patients had dysregulation of multiple 
immune,  metabolic,  adhesion,  and  carcinogenic  path-
ways (Fig. 6D). As well, Figure S3A and S3B showed the 
differentially expressed and enrichment analyses between 
wild type and mutant TP53.

We  estimated  the  relative  abundances  of  infiltrating 
immune subpopulations by ssGSEA and found that CD8+ 
T  cells,  checkpoints,  cytolytic  activity,  Th1  cells,  and 
Th2 cells were exhausted in the TP53-mut group with a 
characteristic  immune  microenvironment  (Figure  S3C). 
Furthermore, we found that the high-risk TP53 missense 
mutation  DLBCL  lacked  multiple  immune  cells,  includ-
ing neutrophil, type 17 T helper cell, mast cell, type 2 T 
helper  cell,  type  1  T  helper  cell,  effector  memeory  CD4 
T cell, CD56bright natural killer cell, immature dendritic 
cell,  plasmacytoid  dendritic  cell,  effector  memeory  CD8 
T cell, and central memory CD4 T cell (Fig. 6E). In order 
to  examine  the  inflammatory  cytokines,  we  used  the 
Wilcoxon test to compare the cytokine expression levels 
among the various TP53 missense mutation DLBCL risk 
groups. As a result, the expression levels of IL1, IL-5, IL-
7,  IL-15,  and  MCP-1  were  significantly  down-regulated 
in missense mutation high-risk group (Figure S4A). ICPs 
reflect  the  immune  status  of  the  tumor  microenviron-
ment. The expression levels of 46 ICP-related modulators 

IC50  analysis  using 

were further analyzed, and we found that BTLA, CD200, 
CD244,  CD28,  CD40LG,  CTLA4,  IDO1,  IDO2,  LAG3, 
LGALS9,  PDCD1,  TMIGD2,  TNFRSF18,  TNFRSF25, 
TNFSF14,  and  TNFSF15  were  dramatically  downregu-
lated  in  high-risk  group  (P < 0.05,  Figure  S4B),  resulting 
in unfavorable prognosis. Taken together, the TP53 mis-
sense  mutation  risk  model  was  related  to  the  immune 
response.
The 

‘oncoPredict’  predicted 
that  patients  in  high-risk  group  were  more  sensitive 
to  TW  37_1149,  Shikonin_170,  Motesanib_1029,  and 
NU7441_1038  compared  to  the  low-risk  group  and  the 
non-missense  mutation  group  (Figure  S5A-S5D).  Com-
pared to the non-missense mutation group, the high-risk 
group  had  greater  sensitivity  to  multiple  kinase  inhibi-
tors  (Dabrafenib_1373,  Olaparib_1017,  Veliparib_1018, 
Pilaralisib_372,  Dactolisib_1057), 
Rucaparib_1175, 
antimetabolites 
(Pemetrexed_428,  Cytarabine_1006), 
DNA  damaging  agents  (Cisplatin_1005),  P53  transcrip-
tional  activity  activator  (Tenovin-6_342),  and  Pevone-
(Figure  S5E-S5O).  Additionally,  AKT 
distat_1529 
inhibitor VIII_228 was more suitable for patients in low-
risk group (Figure S5P).

We  employed  GSEA  to  acquire  the  enrichment  path-
way  of  DLBCL  cell  lines  grouped  in  several  ways  in  the 
CCLE databases. The information about the 21 cell lines 
is presented in Table S4. In MCD subtype cell lines, the 
KEGG  data  shed  light  on  the  TP53  mutation  positively 
regulated cell cycle and DNA replication pathway, as did 
KEGG  enrichment  analysis  in  EZB  subtype  cell  lines; 
moreover,  the  carbon  metabolism  reprogramming  was 
more enriched in the ST2 subtype [8] (Figure S6A‒S6F). 
By  contrast,  TP53  mutation  was  predicted  to  be  a  posi-
tive regulator of the lysosome and oxidative phosphoryla-
tion pathway in other subtype of DLBCL cell lines (Figure 
S6G and S6H).

TP53PI for precise stratification for TP53-mut DLBCL 
patients

The  Kaplan-Meier  curve  survival  analysis  was  then 
performed  for  the  stratified  TP53  missense  mutation 
patients,  non-missense  mutation  patients,  and  wild-
type  patients.  No  difference  in  survival  was  observed 
between  patients  with  high-risk  TP53  missense  muta-
tion  and  those  with  non-missense  mutation  (P = 0.9164, 
Fig. 7A), while there was no difference between patients 
with  low-risk  missense  mutation  and  wild-type  patients 
(P = 0.1311,  Fig.  7A).  Therefore,  in  our  more  compre-
hensive  study  of  TP53  mutations,  DLBCL  patients  with 
high-risk  missense  mutation  were  treated  equally  to 
those with non-missense mutation. Based on the univari-
ate Cox regression result described in Figure S7, signifi-
cant  variables  were  further  performed  multivariate  Cox 
regression  analysis.  As  shown  in  Fig.  7B,  two  variables

(TP53 missense mutation high risk + non-missense muta-
tion  and  IPI  intermediate-  or  high-risk  groups)  retained 
independent  prognostic  significance,  which  constituted 
TP53PI model. As the coefficients of the two variables in 
the  multivariate  COX  regression  are  similar,  0.8214  and 
0.9268, respectively, we simplified the model and set the 
score of these two variables to 1. The specific risk grades 
in  TP53PI  model  are  described  as  follows:  (1)  low  risk, 
score = 0; (2) intermediate risk, score = 1; and (3) high risk, 
score = 2. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the TP53PI model 
were  plotted  (P < 0.0001,  Fig.  7C).  In  addition,  the  sur-
vival of the TP53PI low-risk group is similar to that of the 
TP53-wt  IPI  low-risk  group  (P = 0.6344,  Fig.  7C),  while 
the  survival  of  the  TP53PI  intermediate  risk  group  and 
the TP53-wt IPI intermediate-high risk group did not dif-
fer (P = 0.0672, Fig. 7C). ROC analysis displayed that the 
risk  stratification  of  TP53PI  model  had  better  discrimi-
nation to TP53 missense mutation risk model + non-mis-
sense mutation for OS (AUC: 0.7172 vs. 0.6298, Fig. 7D). 
Moreover, the calibration plots demonstrated good con-
cordance  between  predicted  and  observed  probabilities 
(Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Up  to  this  point,  the  prognostic  significance  of  TP53 
mutation  in  DLBCL  patients  has  been  debated  in  sev-
eral previous studies [31]. Hong Y et al. recently analyzed 
DLBCL  patients  with  TP53  mutation  for  preliminary 
stratification  [11].  A  TP53  mutation  rate  of  16%  was 
observed in their analysis, and the profile of TP53 muta-
tions  was  predictive  of  poor  OS  and  PFS,  despite  the 
close  survival  curves  between  the  two  groups.  Accord-
ing  to  subgroup  analysis,  they  found  that  TP53  muta-
tion  differed  in  prognostic  significance  among  different 
subgroups.

In  view  of  the  diversity  and  heterogeneity  of  TP53 
gene  mutations  and  functional  variations,  the  impact  of 
each mutation/variation on a specific patient’s prognosis 
should be evaluated individually based on the type, site, 
and  affected  target  genes.  According  to  the  traditional 
view of determining a “good prognosis” or a “poor prog-
nosis” based only on the status of TP53 gene, which can 
be either wild type or mutant, is inaccurate. The impact 
of  TP53  mutations  on  prognosis  varies  greatly  among 
different  molecular  subtypes:  in  MYD88  and  BCL-2 
subtypes,  TP53  mutations  indicate  poor  prognosis;  in 

Du et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2024) 22:401  
Page 13 of 16

NOTCH2  or  SOCS1/SGK1  subtypes,  TP53  mutations 
have  no  significant  impact  on  prognosis;  and  in  the 
TET2/SGK1 subtype, TP53 mutations are rare [15].

We  examined  the clinical features and  TP53 mutation 
data of 2637 reported cases in order to identify the char-
acteristics and prognostic significance of TP53 mutation 
in  DLBCL  patients  in  the  present  study.  We  revealed  a 
TP53  mutation  prevalence  of  14.0%  in  DLBCL  patients, 
which is lower than those of previous reports in DLBCL 
(20‒25%) [32]. The majority of TP53 mutations was mis-
sense  mutation,  and  most  mutations  occurred  in  the 
DBD,  with  hot  spots  at  codons  248,  245,  273,  175  and 
282,  suggesting  these  motifs  were  essential  for  TP53 
tumor suppression.

This  finding  of  our  study  and  clinical  practice  sug-
gested  that  not  all  patients  with  TP53  mutations  had  a 
fatal outcome. Therefore, our research aims to construct 
an innovative model to predict prognosis and accurately 
distinguish  the  risks  of  TP53-mut  DLBCL  patients.  It 
will  facilitate  the  prediction  and  treatment  of  TP53-
mut  DLBCL.  Furthermore,  we  attempt  to  investigate 
the  molecular  mechanisms  behind  these  characteristics 
using  multi-omics  methods.  In  this  way,  the  correlation 
between the mutation of TP53 and prognosis or response 
to treatment can be understood on a molecular level.

We  successfully  fitted  a  model  with  high  predictive 
accuracy  and  applicability,  which  reduces  the  dimen-
sionality of variables and simplifies the model. The model 
includes  four  indicators:  splice  site  mutation,  high  VAF 
(VAF > 36%),  hotspot  mutations,  and  notDNE_notLOF. 
Previous studies have reported that some hotspot muta-
tions of TP53 (e.g. c.659 A > G, p.Y220C, c.733G > A, and 
p.G245S) have immunogenicity in ovarian cancer, which 
may indicate that they play a role in the immune response 
[33].  However,  this  does  not  mean  that  these  mutations 
are protective factors. Instead, they may be related to the 
activation of the immune system, thereby affecting prog-
nosis. In addition, non-disruptive mutations in the TP53 
DNA-binding  domain  are  also  considered  an  indepen-
dent favorable prognostic factor in esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma [34]. The notDNE_notLOF indicates that 
the TP53 mutation has not affected the normal function 
of the P53 protein.

We further found that there is no difference in survival 
between  the  high-risk  group  of  TP53  missense  muta-
tion and non-missense mutation patients. To stratify the 
entire  population  of  TP53  mutation,  we  ultimately  con-
struct the TP53PI model.

NGS has been widely applied in clinical samples, lead-
ing to several reclassification schemes being proposed in 
previous  studies  [1,  35],  including  the  LymphGen  arith-
metic  which  is  most  commonly  used  [8].  TP53  muta-
tions and deletions were set to A53 subtype. However, in 
A53 type, there are a great many features associated with 

chromosomal  arms  variations,  which  are  challenging  to 
detect with existing NGS methods. Applying the Lymph-
Gen classifier, less than half of TP53-mut DLBCLs were 
classified  as  one  of  the  established  molecular  DLBCL 
subtypes  highlighting  the  unique  biology  of  this  entity 
(Fig.  2D).  Due  to  different  mutation  status  of  the  Lym-
phGen  subtypes  and  distinct  microenvironmental  com-
positions, they responded differently to therapy targeting 
oncogenic  signal  pathways  and  immunotherapy.  A53 
displayed  relatively  low  levels  of  all  immune  signatures. 
In  addition,  B2M  is  deleted  or  mutationally  inactivated, 
allowing A53 patients to escape immune surveillance [36, 
37].

Furthermore,  we  investigated  the  potential  mecha-
nisms of TP53 missense mutation heterogeneity at both 
the  genomic  and  transcriptomic  levels.  In  the  high-risk 
group,  immune,  metabolic,  adhesion,  and  PI3K-AKT 
signaling  pathways  are  dysfunctional.  Inspired  by  these 
findings  in  previous  studies,  we  focused  on  immune-
related  pathways  and  examined  the  immune-infiltrating 
microenvironment of the TP53 missense mutation high-
risk DLBCLs. Our results show that the high-risk group 
has an absolute immune-suppressive microenvironment, 
with  a  reduced  number  of  various  immune  cells,  which 
are  anti-tumor  immune  cells.  The  analysis  of  immune 
checkpoints  also  shows  a  generally  downregulated  state 
in the high-risk group, with a reduction in the number of 
immune cells or impaired function, which may not be suf-
ficient to promote an effective immune response and may 
further adversely affect the effects of immunotherapy.

As a result of oncoPredict’s drug sensitivity prediction 
results,  patients  in  TP53  missense  mutations  high-risk 
group  are  likely  to  be  more  sensitive  to  kinase  inhibi-
tors and MCL1 inhibitors, than other TP53-mut DLBCL 
patients. Among them, MCL1 inhibitors (TW37) may be 
effective for TP53 missense mutations high-risk DLBCL 
patients, especially when used in combination with other 
drugs.  The  MCL1  protein  belongs  to  the  BCL-2  family 
of  anti-apoptotic  proteins.  BCL-2  inhibitor  venetoclax/
ABT-199 has been approved for the treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML)  [38,  39].  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  venetoclax  ini-
tially  responds  well  in  many  patients,  clinical  data  indi-
cate that most patients will relapse, and the latest analysis 
indicates  that  CLL  or  AML  with  TP53  mutation  have  a 
worse  prognosis  after  venetoclax  treatment  than  those 
with TP53 wild type [40, 41]. PI3K inhibitors can reduce 
the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR by blocking the 
activity of PI3K, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, sur-
vival,  and  metabolism  of  tumor  cells.  PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathways are significantly disturbed in the high-
risk  group  of  patients  with  TP53  missense  mutations. 
PI3K inhibitors can reduce the energy supply and protein 
synthesis of tumor cells by blocking this pathway, thereby

compound,  which  is  a  P53  activator,  capable  of  stabiliz-
ing and activating P53 by binding to the MDM2 inhibitor 
of  the  P53  protein,  thereby  activating  the  P53-mediated 
signaling pathway [42]. It appears that this drug is more 
suitable for the treatment of patients in high-risk groups. 
Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  P53  regulatory  network, 
it  is  difficult  to  overcome  the  adverse  effects  of  TP53 
mutations  by  blocking  a  single  pathway,  so  it  is  neces-
sary to further seek appropriate combination schemes to 
improve the therapeutic effect.

In the MCD and EZB subtype, the presence of a TP53 
mutation  could  potentially  lead  to  an  upregulation  or 
enhanced  activity  of  genes  involved  in  these  pathways 
which  are  crucial  for  cell  division  and  DNA  synthesis. 
In  the  ST2  subtype,  the  KEGG  data  highlight  a  differ-
ent  pattern,  which  suggests  that  TP53  mutations  in  this 
subtype  might  be  associated  with  alterations  in  meta-
bolic processes, potentially affecting how cells utilize and 
metabolize  carbon  sources  for  energy  and  biosynthesis. 
In contrast to the MCD and EZB subtypes, TP53 muta-
tions in other subtypes of DLBCL cell lines are predicted 
to  be  positive  regulators  of  the  lysosome  and  oxidative 
phosphorylation  pathways.  Oxidative  phosphorylation 
is  a  process  in  cellular  respiration  that  produces  ATP. 
Enhanced  oxidative  phosphorylation  could  suggest  a 
higher  energy  demand  or  an  adaptation  to  metabolic 
stress.  In  summary,  these  results  indicate  that  TP53 
mutations  have  different  effects  on  cellular  pathways  in 
different DLBCL subtypes.

It is important to note that this study has some limita-
tions. Data from the public database is partially missing, 
and  further  external  data  verification  is  necessary.  Par-
ticularly, due to the lack of loss of the non-mutated allele 
in  some  cohorts  and  the  different  assessment  criteria 
of  various  detection  methods,  we  did  not  proceed  with 
further  analysis  in  this  issue.  In  order  to  truly  explain 
the  particularity  of  the  immune  microenvironment,  it  is 
necessary  to  analyze  the  immune  microenvironment  by 
means  more  closed  to  the  real  state,  such  as  single-cell 
RNA sequencing.

In  conclusion,  we  developed  a  TP53PI  model  for  pre-
cise  risk  stratification  for  TP53-mut  DLCBL  patients 
and  the  potential  underlying  mechanisms  of  different 
prognosis  might  be  explained  by  the  unique  immune 
microenvironments.
