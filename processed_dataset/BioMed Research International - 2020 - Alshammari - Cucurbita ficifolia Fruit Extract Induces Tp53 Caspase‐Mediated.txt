The second most biggest cancer worldwide is breast cancer. There is an increasing need for safer, eﬀective, and aﬀordable drug
candidates from natural sources to treat breast cancer. In the present investigation, the anticancer eﬀect of Cucurbita ﬁcifolia
Bouché (C. ﬁcifolia) fruit extract was tested on the human breast cancer cells such as MCF-7. The cells were exposed with
diﬀerent doses of C. ﬁcifolia, for the assessment of IC50 concentrations on the MCF-7 cell lines for 24 hs. The eﬀect of C. ﬁcifolia
fruit extract on morphological and apoptotic changes were evaluated by speciﬁc ﬂuorescence staining techniques and real-time
PCR in a time-dependent manner for 24 hs and 48 hs. The IC50 value for C. ﬁcifolia fruit extract was found to be 90 μg/mL.
Morphological alteration and apoptotic distinctiveness aspect like chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were
noticed in C. ﬁcifolia extract exposed breast cancer cells. Further, we observed that C. ﬁcifolia extract-induced programmed cell
death in the MCF-7 cells were mediated with the elevated expression of the tumor suppressor gene such as p53 and apoptotic
markers such as caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, fatty acid synthase (FAS), Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD),
Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). These observations established that C. ﬁcifolia
signiﬁcantly concealed the cell division and provoked p53/caspase-mediated programmed cell death. Further, we noticed that
this cell death in MCF-7 cells is concentration and time dependent. As evaluated through the comet assay, C. ﬁcifolia induced
DNA damage; further upon increasing the duration of the treatment, the DNA damage was higher than before. Thus, our study
concludes that C. ﬁcifolia could serve as an eﬀective anticancer agent through vital gene modulation.

1. Introduction

The most widespread cancer around the world in women is
breast cancer, with nearly 2 million fresh patients diagnosed
in 2018. This data shows that ~12% of all new cancer patients
and 25% of all cancers in women are breast cancer. On the
one hand, the incidence of breast cancer is increasing every
year; on the other hand, mechanisms leading to the progres-
sion of breast cancer are still in mercy. The molecular mech-
anisms and genetic alterations in this disease have not been
completely established [1]. The occurrence of breast cancer
is increasing in the developing world due to the increase in
urbanization, unhealthy dietary habits, and adoption of
Western lifestyles [2].

Numerous studies show that evasion of programmed cell
death (PCD) is one of the properties acquired by cancer cells.
On the other hand, research reports show that PCD is a wide-
spread mechanism through which most of the cancer chemo-
therapeutic agents exert their anticancer eﬀect [3]. Studies
show that gene-regulating apoptosis can mediate chemosen-
sitivity [4, 5]. Various research data report that p53 level
could be one of the signiﬁcant determinants for tumor che-
mosensitivity [6, 7]. It is known that ~50% of all human
tumors have mutated tumor suppressor gene p53 (TSG-
p53) [8]. Further, it is observed that loss of regular p53 func-
tion is implicated in hereditary as well as sporadic breast can-
cer. Because of the TSG mutation, breast cancer shows
diﬀerent response to conventional cancer drugs [9]. On the

other hand, these cancer cells also develop drug resistance to
normal drug therapy [10]. The low eﬃciency of present che-
motherapeutic drugs has warranted new research into diﬀer-
ent foundations to progress existing therapy regime or to
serve as a revenue of chemoprevention.

PCD is described by the commencement of precise cyste-
ine proteases branded as caspases, chromatin compression,
DNA disintegration, and cell contraction. Two apoptotic
passageways congregate on caspase-3, the extrinsic pathway
concerning caspase-8 activation, and the intrinsic pathway
involving mitochondrial discharge of cytochrome c and com-
mencement of caspase-9 activation [11]. Apoptosis is a key
factor for the evaluation of potential agents for cancer treat-
ment and prevention [12].

Almost all cancer cells show drug resistance and also low-
ered eﬃcacy to the currently used chemotherapeutic sub-
stances; this urged all cancer researchers to search novel
drugs from natural foundations. Even though the existing
chemotherapeutic agents are talented to hinder or slaughter
tumor cells, the problem of toxicity and adverse eﬀects
restrict the clinical usage of these chemicals as a drug candi-
date. A natural substance, which could slaughter the cancer
cells and has nil or less toxicity on healthy cells, is considered
a good candidate for cancer therapeutic strategies [13].
Cucurbita ﬁcifolia Bouché (C. ﬁcifolia),

from the
Cucurbitaceae family, is grown in the whole world as a
food crop as well as a traditional medicine. Further, this
plant has been used in China, Argentina, India, Brazil,
and Iran as traditional medicine [14]. This plant has been
acknowledged as a functional food because of its numerous
medicinal application [15–17]. Further, anti-inﬂammatory
cardiovascular and hepatoprotective substances have been iso-
lated from this plant, and cytotoxicity was also established
[18]. In addition, the mature fruit macerated in water has been
used for the treatment of diabetes [19]. The antiobese eﬀect
has been reported in literature [20]. Recently, we have estab-
lished its antilipogenic eﬀect through mesenchymal stem cell
transition [21].

As part of the larger project, the present study focused
on the investigation of cytotoxicity of the chloroform extract
of C. ﬁcifolia in breast cancer MCF-7 cell
lines. Besides
studying the cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, the present study
speciﬁcally analyzed the eﬀect of the C. ﬁcifolia chloroform
extract on Tp53/caspase-mediated apoptosis to ﬁnd out the
probable mechanism of cell death in MCF-7 cell lines. Fur-
ther, we also assayed the eﬀect of the C. ﬁcifolia extract on
normal rat hepatocytes.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Plant Material and Extraction. Cucurbita ﬁcifolia Bouché
(C. ﬁcifolia) fruit extract was selected on the basis of ethno-
pharmacology. C. ﬁcifolia fruit was collected from reputable
farms in the month of April 2015, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The plant material was authenticated by Dr. Jacob Thomas
Pandalayil, Herbarium Division, College of Science, King
Saud University, Riyadh 11451 (no. KSU-7965), Saudi Ara-
bia. The whole fruit excluding the outer shell was dried in a
shaded place and ground and soaked in chloroform for

extraction. The solvent amount was taken 10 times more
than the amount of ground plant substance. Extraction was
carried out three times for an overall time period of 24 hs.
Under reduced pressure, the extract was allowed to evaporate
to dryness at 30°C. For the experimental purpose, 100 mg of
the extract was dissolved in 10 mL Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (10% FCS) to get a stock solution
(10 mg/mL) and was additionally thinned with a medium
to various concentrations ranging between 0 and 150 μg/mL
for the study. In our previous study, we have identiﬁed the
in the C. ﬁcifolia fruit: D-
active components present
glucopyranosylamine (67.8%), n-hexadecanoic acid (17.7%),
and 1,4-cyclooctadiene (15.8%) as major components using
GC-MS NIST library analysis [21].

2.2. Maintenance of MCF-7 Cells. The mycoplasma-free
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was used for the current investi-
gation. The MCF-7 cell was cultured and allowed to grow in
90% DMEM + phenol red, complemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and streptomycin/penicillin (0.1 mg/100
units, mL) in a humidiﬁed ambiance of 95% air and 5% CO2
at 37°C. Every single one of the experimental investigations
was performed in cells grown to ~70% to 80% conﬂuence.
All the experiments were performed between the 3rd and
5th passages of MCF-7 cells. After the experimental periods,
the cells were collected following trypsinization. The Trypan
blue exclusion test was used to assay cell viability. The control
cell viability was found to be superior than 95%.

2.3. CellTiter-Blue® Viability Assays.
In MCF-7 cells,
CellTiter-Blue® Viability Assay (Promega) was carried out
to evaluate the toxicity of various doses of the C. ﬁcifolia
extract. The manufacturer’s directions were exactly followed
to carry out the experiment. In detail, MCF-7 cells (2 × 104
cells/well) were grown in 96-well cell culture plates and
exposed with 0-150 μg/mL of extract for 24 hs. After the
experimental period, 40 μL of cell titer blue viability solution
was straightway added to the experimental cells, and incuba-
tion was continued further for 6 hs at 37°C. Using a Bio-Rad
microplate ﬂuorescence reader, the ﬂuorescence intensity
was recorded at 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission ﬁl-
ter. IC50 was derived from the above said reading. Quadru-
plet samples were run for every experimental doses of the
C. ﬁcifolia extract in three autonomous experiments. The
results were expressed as mean ± SD.

2.4. Studies on Normal Hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were iso-
lated from a healthy rat and maintained as explained by Sub-
astri et al. [22]. The cells were exposed to C. ﬁcifolia extract
(0-150 μg/mL) for 24 hs. After the experimental period, cell
viability was assayed as mentioned above.

2.5. TUNEL Assay. To study the concentration- and time-
dependent eﬀect of the C. ﬁcifolia extract on apoptosis, the
DeadEnd® TUNEL Assay kit (Promega) was employed. The

manufacturer’s directions were stringently followed.
In
detail, cells (MCF-7 cells (1:5 × 106 cells/well)) were subcul-
tured a 6-well plate and allowed to grow for semiconﬂuence.
Cells were exposed to a fresh medium containing the C. ﬁci-
folia extract at a concentration of 90 μg/mL for 24 hrs and
48 hrs. Subsequent to the experimental duration, the culture
medium containing the C. ﬁcifolia extract was removed,
and experimental cells were washed twice with ice-cold
PBS. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% methanol-free formaldehyde
solution. After ﬁxing, cells were again washed with normal
PBS (twice) and stained according to the DeadEnd ﬂuo-
rometric TUNEL scheme procedure. Control and experimen-
tal cells stained with TUNEL assay solutions were observed
under a Carl-Zeiss (Axiovert) epiﬂuorescence microscope
using a triple bandpass ﬁlter. Each condition minimum of
ten random ﬁelds consisting around 1000 cells was counted
and percent apoptotic positive cells were calculated. For cal-
culation purpose, a person who is blind of the experimental
condition was employed.

2.6. Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide (AO/EB) Staining.
To distinguish apoptotic and necrotic cells, AO/EB staining
procedure was adopted as explained by Subastri et al. [23].
In brief, MCF-7 cells were grown in 24-well cell culture plates
(105 cells/well). After noticing semiconﬂuence, cells were
exposed to the C. ﬁcifolia extract (90 μg/mL) for 24 hrs and
48 hrs. After the experimental period, the cells were washed
with PBS and stained with AO/EB dye mix (100 μg/mL of
AO and 100 μg/mL of EB in PBS) for 5 min. Stained cells
were washed with PBS to remove excess staining solution.
The necrotic, apoptotic, and healthy cells were distinguished
under the ﬂuorescent microscope at 400x magniﬁcation.

2.7. Quantitative PCR Analysis through Real Time. Diﬀer-
ences in key apoptotic genes were analyzed in the control
and experimental cells. For the above said purpose, we have
used the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast. Further, a real-time SYBR Green/ROX
gene expression assay kit from QIAGEN was employed. Fas-
tlane® Cell cDNA kit from QIAGEN was used to make the
cDNA from diﬀerent experimental cells. The mRNA levels
of caspase-8, caspsase-3, caspase-9, protein-53 (p53), FAS,
Fas-associated death domain (FADD), Bcl-2-associated X
protein (BAX), and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer
(BAK) as well as the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3 phos-
phate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were assayed in diﬀerent
experimental conditions. We used gene-speciﬁc SYBR
Green-based QuantiTect® Primer assays from QIAGEN.
the manufacturer’s
For quantitative real-time RT-PCR,
instruction was followed to make a reaction volume of
25 μL. This mixture contains a master mix of 12.5 μL, primer
volume (2.5 μL) (10x), and 100 μg of template cDNA (10 μL)
added to every condition. Following a tiny centrifugation, the
PCR plate was proceeded to 35 cycles of PCR reaction. The
reaction cycle is as follows: the PCR activation at 95°C for 5
minutes, denaturation at 95°C for 5 seconds, and annealin-
g/extension at 60°C for 10 seconds. Control and experimental
conditions were run in triplicates on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-
time PCR system. After the PCR cycle, the quantitative RT-

PCR data was analysed. The comparative threshold (Ct)
technique and the fold inductions of the test were evaluated
against the healthy untreated cells. For each and every condi-
tion, the GAPDH expression was quantiﬁed and served as an
internal reference gene. The expression proﬁle of diﬀerent
apoptotic genes was normalised against the GAPDH gene.
Further, the expression pattern of diﬀerent apoptotic genes
in the healthy control and C. ﬁcifolia extract-exposed cells
for 24 hrs and 48 hrs was calculated through the Ct value.
The data were mentioned as the ratio of the GAPDH gene
to objective the gene by using the subsequent formula: ΔCt
= Ct ðapoptotic genesÞ − Ct ðGAPDHÞ. To estimate the com-
parative expression patterns, the subsequent formula was
employed: ΔΔCt = ΔCt ðtreatedÞ − ΔCt ðcontrolÞ. In crisp,
the expression patterns were mentioned as n-level diﬀerences
comparative to that of the calibrator. The calculated data was
used to plot the expression of apoptotic genes using the
expression of 2-ΔΔCt [24].

2.8. DNA Damage by Comet Analysis. To estimate DNA
damage in individual cells, the comet procedure was adopted
as mentioned in Suyavaran et al., 2015.

2.9. Statistical Analysis. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to calculate statistical diﬀerences. The
diﬀerent experimental samples were compared by Duncan’s
multiple range test (DMRT) using SPSS Software Package,
version 11.0. Data were mentioned as mean ± S:D. (n = 6 in
each sample). A value of P ≤ 0:05 was considered to be statis-
tically signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Eﬀect of C. ﬁcifolia Extract on Cell Cytotoxicity in MCF-7
Cells. The CellTiter-Blue® Viability Assay was employed to
formulate a preliminary estimation of the cytotoxicity eﬀect
of the C. ﬁcifolia chloroform extract on MCF-7 cells. Further,
to evaluate the individual IC50 at diﬀerent doses of the C. ﬁci-
folia extract (0-150 μg/mL), cells were exposed for 24 hrs and
48 hrs. A concentration-dependent decrease in cell viablity
was noticed after 24 hr exposure to the C. ﬁcifolia extract,
and the IC50 of the C. ﬁcifolia extract for MCF-7 cells was
found to be 90 ± 5 μg/mL (Figure 1(a)). Normal hepatocytes
were exposed to diﬀerent concentrations of the C. ﬁcifolia
extract. We found that IC50 of the C. ﬁcifolia extract for hepa-
tocytes is 130 ± 8 μg/mL (Figure 1(b)). P < 0:05 signiﬁcance
was observed at 75 μg/mL; the concentration of C. ﬁcifolia
at 24 hrs was 50 μg/mL at 48 hrs, indicating that when the
duration of exposure increased, the concentration of the
extract required to inhibit cell growth is (P < 0:01 and P <
0:001) decreased. This result indicate that C. ﬁcifolia extract
more sensitive for MCF-7 cells.

3.2. Eﬀect of C. ﬁcifolia Extract on Apoptosis-Mediated Cell
Death through TUNEL Assay. The apoptotic eﬀect of the C.
ﬁcifolia extract on MCF-7 cells was shown in Figures 2 and
3. We have used the TUNEL assay method to assess the C.
ﬁcifolia extract-induced apoptotic cell death. In the exposure
of MCF-7 cells to the C. ﬁcifolia extract, a time-dependent
elevation in the induction of apoptosis was noticed. The

triplicate.

IC50 dose (90 μg/mL) of C. ﬁcifolia extract-exposed cells
shows 27 ± 4% (P < 0:001) TUNEL positive at 24 hrs, when
compared with untreated healthy control cells. When the
duration of the C. ﬁcifolia extract exposure was increased,
we have observed 42 ± 9% (P < 0:001) TUNEL-positive cells
at 48 hrs when compared with normal cells.

3.3. Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide Staining. AO/EB
staining was employed to investigate the induction of apo-
ptotic nuclear damage in the cytotoxicity of the C. ﬁcifolia
extract on MCF-7. Microscopic observations of cells stained

with AO/EB indicated that untreated cells (negative control)
displayed normal nuclear morphology with a bright green
ﬂuorescence. Whereas the cells treated with the C. ﬁcifolia
extract for 24 hrs and 48 hrs showed early apoptotic cells with
greenish yellow nuclei, late apoptotic cells indicated con-
densed orange-red nuclei, while dead cells depicted red
nuclei. Nuclear fragmentation, presence of apoptotic bodies,
chromatin condensation, and membrane blabbing of apopto-
tic cells were also obvious upon assessment of AO/EB-
stained cells under a ﬂuorescent microscope (Figure 4).

3.4. Eﬀect of C. ﬁcifolia Extract on Quantiﬁcation of mRNA
Levels of Apoptotic-Related Genes. To investigate the molecu-
lar mechanism of C. ﬁcifolia extract-induced apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells, the expression levels of various apoptosis-
related genes were examined by real-time PCR. Figures 5
and 6 summarize the C. ﬁcifolia extract-induced apoptotic
gene expression levels in the fold change of p53, caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 and FADD, FAS, BAK, and BAX
in MCF-7 cells as compared to the control. The upregulated
expression of p53 (P < 0:001, vs. the respective control;
24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P < 0:05), caspase-3 (P < 0:001 vs. the
respective control; 24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P < 0:05), caspase-8
(P < 0:001 vs. the respective control; 24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P <
0:05), and caspase-9 (P < 0:001 vs. the respective control;
24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P < 0:05), genes in MCF-7 cells treated with
90 μg/mL of the C. ﬁcifolia extract for 24 and 48 hs (Figure 5).
Similarly, the expression levels of FADD (P < 0:001 vs.
the respective control; 24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P < 0:05), FAS
(P < 0:001 vs. the respective control; 24 hrs vs 48 hrs, P <
0:05), BAK (P < 0:001 vs. the respective control; 24 hrs vs.
48 hrs, P < 0:05), and BAX (P < 0:001 vs. the respective con-
trol; 24 hrs vs. 48 hrs, P < 0:05) in MCF-7 cells treated with
90 μg/mL C. ﬁcifolia extract for 24 and 48 hs were up-
regulated as compared to control (Figure 6).

in Figures 7(b)–7(d). Control cells at 24 hs and 48 hs showed
a nil comet pattern (Figures 7(a), i and iii); on the other
hand, cells treated with C. ﬁcifolia showed statistically
(P < 0:001) signiﬁcant number of cells with DNA damage
(Figures 7(a), ii and iv and Figure 7(b)). Tail
length of
treated cells (Figure 7(c)) is increased (P < 0:01) than that
of untreated cells. Further, the increase in the duration of
treatment augments the DNA damage (P < 0:001). Further,
the results shows that control cells (Figure 7(d)) have higher
percent of DNA in the head (>92%) and the tail region con-
tains only ~5-7% DNA. For MCF-7 cells exposed with C.
ﬁcifolia alone (Figure 7(d)), the percent of DNA in the head
region was decreased (P < 0:001) (~65% at 24 hs and~15% at
48 hs) and in the tail region was increased (P < 0:001) (~35%
at 24 hs and ~85 at 48 hs) when compared to untreated
MCF-7 cells.

4. Discussion

[29],

In many countries, pumpkin is used for its medicinal value as
an antidiabetic as well as for the management of parasites and
worms. In the past few decades, researchers have concen-
trated on the antidiabetic [25, 26], antihypertension [26],
antibacterial, antifungal [27, 28] antihypercholesterolemic,
immunomodulatory, anti-
intestinal antiparasitic
inﬂammatory [30], and analgesic eﬀects of pumpkin [31].
Polysaccharides present
in the pumpkin are known to
increase the cell immune function and are responsible for
the immunomodulatory activity of pumpkin [32]. Further-
more, the augmentation of splenic lymphocyte proliferation,
natural killer cell activity, and an elevation in the number of
CD8+, CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio have been

extracts [34, 35]. The cytotoxicity technique commonly has a
wide range of understanding and is capable of sensing vari-
ous novel anticancer compounds. Further, these compounds
are capable of inhibiting the biochemical function in diﬀerent
human as well as animal cancer cell origin. Treatment with
the C. ﬁcifolia extract to the culture medium prevented the
proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner, revealing its cytotoxic potential. These ﬁndings
agree that diﬀerent in vitro investigations reported that phar-
macologically eﬀective compounds from natural sources pro-
ﬁciently decrease the viability of mammalian cancer cells
through a wide mode of action [36, 37]. Normal hepatocytes
were exposed to the C. ﬁcifolia extract; it showed a higher

IC50 value than that of MCF-7 cells. This study indicates
the diﬀerent compassion of the C. ﬁcifolia extract on nor-
mal cells.

We observed a little but obvious elevation in DNA strand
breaks by adopting the most sensitive technique such as
TUNEL assay, in the extract of C. ﬁcifolia-treated MCF-7
cells as compared to untreated cells. The C. ﬁcifolia extract
showed the morphological characteristics of apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells. As observed by other investigators, TUNEL
assay shows the type of DNA damage, which is essential for
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. These ﬁndings also denote that
the TUNEL technique may have shown positive results for
infrequent DNA damage. Similar observations were (large

fragment formation) reported in other compound-induced
cancer cytotoxicity-mediated cell death [38].

Normal healthy live cells become visible with uniformly
green color stained with AO/EB, whereas early apoptotic cells

appeared as green with a bright dot in the nuclei, which is due
to the result of chromatin condensation. Late apoptotic cells
also integrated the EB stain and henceforth were observed as
orange, but, in distinction to necrotic cells, the late apoptotic
cells were observed as condensed [39]. The treatment with
the C. ﬁcifolia extract induced a higher level of apoptotic
death. Moreover, ﬁndings of the AO/EB staining conﬁrmed
that the extract of C. ﬁcifolia brings about cytological changes
such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, cytoplasmic blebbing, frag-
mentation of chromatin, bi-/multinucleation, late apoptosis
indication of dot-like chromatin, and apoptotic body conﬁg-
uration. The current ﬁndings proved that the mode of cell
death induced through a plant extract was apoptosis not
through necrosis mechanisms [40].

Inhibiting cancer cell proliferation through an apoptotic
mechanism becomes an obvious mode of action of the
numerous anticancer compounds [41, 42]. Apoptotic event
could be initiated through the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways
[43]. The aspartate-speciﬁc group of cysteine protease called
caspases plays a central mechanism in amending the apopto-
sis initiated by various types of stimuli, including oxidative
stress [44]. Practically, caspase-3 is the central executor in
the apoptotic event and caspase-9 is an originator of
caspase-3 via the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated
pathway [45]. There is enough evidence for the role of p53
in the regulation of the membrane expression of certain
death receptors in several cell types [46]. A tumor suppressor
protein such as p53 can also serve as a transcription factor.
This protein regulates cell growth as well as cell death (apo-
ptosis) in response to diﬀerent modes of cellular anxiety or
cell injury [47]. Functional loss of p53 weakens the response
of cells to apoptotic motivation; this property is commonly
observed in most of the human cancer cells. Thus, p53
appears to convey a signal to the apoptotic machines down-
stream of mitochondria [48]. In this study, we demonstrated
that caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and Tp53 expres-
sions were signiﬁcantly increased in cells treated with the C.
ﬁcifolia extract.

Fas ligand (FasL) induces apoptosis in a mode compara-
ble to that of the TNF receptor. Interaction of the ligand
develops receptor clustering, death-inducing signal complex
development, and the commencement of the caspase cascade
machinery. On the other hand, signaling through the Fas
receptor is a little uncomplicated than through the TNF
receptor. FADD, an adapter protein, could be directly
employed to the death province of the Fas receptor, without
involvement of the preemployment of the TRADD. Further-
more, the Fas receptor is commonly considered to just trigger
apoptosis and activate the signaling [49]. In our results, we
observed that the C. ﬁcifolia treatment upregulated the
expressions of Fas and FADD proteins leading to apoptosis
of MCF-7 cells, which is mediated by caspase-8 interaction
with FAS and FADD proteins.

The intrinsic (or mitochondrial) PCD cascade is initiated
as a reaction to cellular stress. Proapoptotic BH3-only pro-
teins are activated in the PCD intrinsic pathway. BAX and
BAK are directly activated through BH3-only proteins by
making its direct interactions with the above said protein;
further, it can also activate through indirect mode by making

an interaction with prosurvival Bcl-2-like proteins. Upon
activation of BAX and BAK, these proteins forms oligomeri-
zation and helps to form pores in the mitochondrial outer
membrane that release cytochrome c. Increased cytosolic
cytochrome c concentration activates the caspases and causes
succeeding cell death [50]. Diaz-Flores et al. [51] reported
that C. ﬁcifolia has an antioxidant eﬀect on the glutathione
redox cycle in mice with STZ-induced diabetes. In this study,
treatment with the C. ﬁcifolia fruit extract upregulated the
expressions of proapoptotic BAX and BAK proteins, result-

ing in apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. It is crystal clear that DNA
damage is one of the hallmarks of apoptosis [52]. Even
though diﬀerent techniques were available to assay DNA
damage, comet assay is the one of most sensitive technique
that detects the DNA damage at individual cells [53]. To val-
idate the increased apoptotic gene expression in C. ﬁcifolia-
treated cells which leads to cellular DNA damage, hence,
we have performed comet assay. This results shows that C.
ﬁcifolia induces the DNA damage. Numerous studies shows
that well known anticancer drugs like cisplatin exerts its

anticancer eﬀect through DNA damage [54–56]. Thus, our
study revealed that the C. ﬁcifolia extract has chemothera-
peutic potential against MCF-7 cells.

5. Conclusions

In this study, we have shown that C. ﬁcifolia exercises its anti-
cancer eﬀect by inhibiting MCF-7 cell propagation. Further,
it initiates the apoptotic process in part by altering the cas-
pase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and p53, FAS, FADD,
BAX, and BAK gene expression levels. Henceforth, the cur-
rent investigation through C. ﬁcifolia signiﬁcantly blocks
the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell proliferation in labora-
tory condition and documents the probable mode of mech-
anism for its anticancer property. So, C. ﬁcifolia could
potentially stand for another source of medicine for breast
cancer treatment. The current investigation supports the
improvement of dietary plant substance-mediated drugs
for the management of breast cancer. However, additional
data are needed to sequence and identify speciﬁc molecules
present in the C. ﬁcifolia extract, which is responsible for its
anticancer eﬀect.
