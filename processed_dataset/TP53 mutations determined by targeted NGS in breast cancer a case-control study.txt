ABSTRACT

Background: Tumor protein 53 (TP53) gene mutations are identified in up to 37% 
of breast tumors especially in HER-2 positive and basal-like subtype. Previous studies 
have indicated TP53 mutations as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. However, 
most of these studies performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of 
TP53 mutations.

Aim: The purpose of our study is to evaluate the role of TP53 somatic mutations 
detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a potential prognostic marker in 
patients with breast cancer.

Materials  and  Methods:  82  female  patients  with  Stage  I–III  breast  cancer 
underwent NGS in paraffin blocks and blood samples during the period 25/09/2019 
through 25/05/2021. 23 cases of somatic TP53 mutations and 23 cases of healthy 
controls were matched on age at diagnosis, menopausal status, histological subtype, 
histological grade, ki67 expression and disease stage.

Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 52.35 (SD; 11.47) years.  The somatic TP53 
mutation  NM_000546.5:c.824G>A  p.(Cys275Tyr)  was  most  frequently  detected. 
Co-existence of PIK3CA mutation was a common finding in somatic TP53-mutant 
tumors (4/23; 17.4%). Disease-free survival was shorter in TP53-mutated cases 
(16.3 months vs. 62.9 months). TP53 pathogenic somatic mutations were associated 
with a 8-fold risk of recurrence in the univariate Cox regression analysis (OR = 8.530, 
95% CI: 1.81–40.117; p = 0.007).

Conclusions:  Our  case-control  study  suggests  that  TP53  somatic  mutations 
detected  by  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  are  associated  with  an  adverse 
prognosis in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

TP53  gene  is  the  most  frequently  mutated  gene 
(>50%)  in  human  cancer,  indicating  its  crucial  role  as 
a tumor suppressor [1]. TP53 gene encodes p53 protein 
which  is  considered  as  “the  guardian  of  the  genome” 
by binding to specific DNA sequences and maintaining 
genomic  stability  [2].  P53  protein  is  involved  in  cell 
response to stress signals, activates DNA repair proteins 

and  regulates  the  production  of  stem  cells  [3].  The 
fundamental  role  of  TP53  is  evident  in  Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome which is characterized by germline mutations of 
TP53 and predisposition to aggressive tumors like early-
onset breast cancer (25%), soft-tissue or bone sarcomas 
(35%) and brain tumors. In breast cancer, germline TP53 
mutations  harbor  5–8%  of  cases  of  early-onset  (under 
30 years old) disease, while up to 85% of women who 
carry germline TP53 mutations eventually develop breast

are identified in 37% of all breast cancers and is more 
frequently mutated in HER-2 positive (72%) and basal-
like subtype (80%) [5]. DNA sequencing is considered 
as the gold-standard for the detection of TP53 mutations 
that usually harbor the exons 5–8 of the gene [6]. More 
recently,  next  generation  sequencing  has  allowed  the 
detection  of  TP53  mutations  outside  this  restricted 
region. 

There are numerous studies assessing the clinical 
significance of TP53 mutations in breast cancer. However, 
the results of these studies are often contradicting. TP53 
mutation was associated with worse prognosis in breast 
cancer  patients  regardless  of  the  tumor  subtype  and 
the  type  of  treatment  administered.  Initially,  p53  IHC 
expression was associated with an adverse prognosis in 
small  retrospective  studies  [7–9].  More  recent  studies 
evaluated  TP53  gene  mutations  in  breast  cancer  via 
DNA sequencing [10–13]. P53 mutation was associated 
with negative estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/
PR)  status  and  increased  mortality  rate  in  859  breast 
cancer women [10]. TP53 mutations within exons 5 to 
8 detected by gene sequencing were related to increased 
risk of breast cancer-specific death regardless of tumor 
size, nodal status and hormone receptor expression [11]. 
Moreover, P53 mutation status has been associated with 
response  to  breast  cancer  treatment.  A  METABRIC 
analysis  of  breast  cancer  patients  that  received  only 
endocrine  treatment  linked  TP53  mutations  to  worse 
survival  [6],  while  a  meta-analysis  of  3,476  cases  of 
patients  receiving  neoadjuvant  treatment  concluded 
that TP53 mutation status is a predictor of response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [14].

The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  evaluate  the  role  of 
somatic TP53 mutations as a potential prognostic marker 
in  Stage  I-III  breast  cancer  patients  treated  in  a  single 
center via a case–control study. The identification of TP53 
mutations was performed via next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) in paraffin blocks of the patients enrolled.

chemotherapy, anti-HER2 treatment, hormonotherapy) in 
cases and controls are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. 

Mean  age  at  diagnosis  was  52.35  (SD;  11.47) 
years  in  cases  and  49.26  years  (SD;  11.27)  years  in 
controls (p = 0.362). Overall, there were not statistically 
significant  differences  between  cases  and  controls  in 
terms of age at diagnosis (p = 0.362), menopausal status 
(p = 0.492), stage at diagnosis (p = 0.802), histology (p =

(p  =  0.760),  grade  (G1  vs.  G2/3;  p  =  0.506)  and  Ki67 
status  (p  =  0.681).  Patients  with  stage  I–III  disease 
(23;  100%)  underwent  surgical  excision  (20;  87%) 
and  adjuvant  radiation  (17;  73.9%).  Invasive  ductal 
carcinoma (IDC) was diagnosed in most of the cases (22; 
95.7%). The majority of cases were hormone receptor-
positive  (14;  60.9%),  HER2-negative  (14;  60.9%)  and 
characterized by low differentiation (17; 73.9%) and high 
Ki67 expression (20; 87%).

Genetic polymorphisms of TP53 somatic 
mutations 

Genetic polymorphisms of TP53 pathogenic somatic 
mutations identified are summarized in Table 3. Of note, 
the  most  frequent  pathogenic  somatic  TP53  mutations 
reported  in  our  patients  were  c.824G>A  p.Cys275Tyr 
(n = 3) and c.743G>A p.Arg248Gln (n = 2) while the other 
polymorphisms were detected only once. 

We  examined  the  presence  of  other  pathogenic 
mutations along with TP53 mutations. The genomic profile 
of our cases is summarized in Table 4. Of note, PIK3CA 
was  the  most  frequent  pathogenic  mutation  detected 
in  somatic  TP53-mutant  tumors  (4/23;  17.4%).  Other 
pathogenic mutations identified included AKT1, PTEN 
and  NRAS  mutations.  Of  note,  a  number  of  mutations 
of unknown significance were frequently reported. The 
most common mutations of unknown significance (VUS) 
identified  were:  ROS1  (10/23),  KMT2C  (6/23),  NF1 
(4/23), RET (2/23), NOTCH1 (2/23).

Survival analysis

Disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated in cases 
and  controls.  DFS  was  16.3  months  in  cases  harboring 
TP53 somatic mutations (95% CI; 11.38–21.25) versus 
62.9  months  in  TP53  wild-type  controls  (95%  CI; 
40.8–85). Somatic TP53 mutations were associated with 
shorter DFS in our study. Figure 1 presents Kaplan Meier 
DFS curves for cases and controls. TP53 mutation was 
associated  with  a  8-fold  risk  of  recurrence  in  the  Cox 
regression analysis (OR = 8.530, 95% CI: 1.81–40.117; 
p = 0.007). 

DISCUSSION

We  here  demonstrate  that  pathogenic  somatic 
TP53 mutations are associated with a decreased disease-
free  survival  in  patients  with  early-stage  breast  cancer. 
We  retrospectively  identified  23  breast  cancer  patients 
harboring  TP53  somatic  mutations  identified  via  next-
generation  sequencing  and  23  TP53  wild-type  controls 
matched  on  age  and  clinicopathological  characteristics. 
DFS  was  significantly  reduced  in  TP53-mutated  cases 
(16 vs. 63 months).

In  our  study  TP53  somatic  mutations  were 
associated  with  high  grade  (G2/3:  22;  95.7%)  and 
high  proliferating  (Ki67  >  20%:  87%)  breast  tumors. 
This is in accordance with previous results that TP53 
mutations  are  more  frequently  identified  in  HER2-

positive  and  triple  negative  breast  tumors  (TNBC), 
while the incidence is low in luminal A tumors. TP53 
mutation is indicative of a more aggressive entity and 
affects tumor response to treatment [15]. P53 regulates 
epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) process and stem cell

Mutant  TP53  tumors  suppress  transcriptional  factors

An  interesting  finding  of  our  study  was  the  co-
existence  of  TP53  mutations  with  pathogenic  somatic 

PIK3CA mutations in the 17.4% of the cases. PIK3CA 
mutations  are  detected  in  more  than  one  third  of 
HR-positive  breast  tumors  (34.5%)  and  less  frequently 
in  HER2-overexpressing  tumors  (22.7%),  whereas  the 

2210

Oncotargetwww.oncotarget.comincidence  drops  to  8.3%  in  triple-negative  and  basal-
like  breast  cancer  [16].  It  has  been  previously  shown 
that co-mutation of TP53 and PIK3CA account for more 
than 6% of breast cancers and for approximately 30% of 
TP53-mutated tumors [17]. Co-mutated tumors represent 
an  aggressive  entity  and  were  associated  with  a  worse 
progression-free survival [17]. In our study, co-existence 
of these mutations was not a rare event. The effect of the 
simultaneous presence of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations 
on response to chemotherapy and prognosis needs to be 
further addressed. 

Our  case-control  study  demonstrated  that  TP53 
pathogenic  somatic  mutations  are  associated  with  a 
reduced  disease-free  survival  in  early-stage  breast 
cancer. In agreement with our findings, previous studies 
report an adverse prognosis in patients harboring TP53 
mutations  [6].  Some  other  studies  suggest  that  TP53 
mutations have a distinct role in different breast cancer 
subtypes. TP53 somatic mutations were associated with 
a worse prognosis in patients with luminal B and HER2-
positive breast tumors, but not in patients with luminal 
A and basal-like tumors [18]. Moreover, TP53 mutations 
are  linked  to  different  response  rates  to  different 
treatment regimens. One study suggests that TP53 wild-
type  tumors  respond  better  to  hormone  therapy,  while 
the opposite effect is identified in patients that receive 
chemotherapy only [19]. TP53 status may have a distinct 
clinical role according to the tumor subtype and the type 
of treatment administered. 

One strength of our study was the detection method 
applied  for  the  identification  of  TP53  mutations.  DNA 
sequencing is currently the gold standard for identification 
of  TP53  mutations  [20].  Recently,  next  generation 
sequencing has emerged as a highly accurate alternative 
since it offers the ability of detecting mutations outside 
exons  5–8.  Accuracy  of  immunohistochemistry  (IHC) 
is  limited  by  the  presence  of  null  mutations  (nonsense 
mutations,  deletions,  insertions  etc)  in  TP53  gene  that 
result  in  a  detectable  but  unstable  protein.  In  these 
cases  that  account  for  up  to  ~40%  of  TP53  mutations 
in breast cancer IHC will fail to detect TP53 mutation. 
Consequently,  IHC  detection  of  TP53  status  should 
be  evaluated  with  caution.  Our  study  overcomes  this 
limitation  by  applying  next  generation  sequencing  in 
patient  samples  further  increasing  the  validity  of  the 
data presented. Despite the originality, limitations of this 
case-control study should be acknowledged. Our study is 
confined to a single institution and thus the sample size is 
limited. More studies with a larger sample size should be 
performed to confirm our results. A multicenter study with 
a similar design could generate more robust scientific data.
We  here  show  that  TP53  pathogenic  somatic 
mutations are associated with a shorter DFS in early-stage 
breast cancer patients. In addition, TP53 mutations often 
coexist with PIK3CA mutations in breast tumors (17.4%). 
Future  well  designed  studies  should  be  performed 
to  address  the  clinical  role  of  the  co-existence  of  these 
mutations in breast cancer.

(±5  years),  histological  subtype  (luminal  A,  luminal 
B,  HER2-enriched,  TNBC),  histological  grade  (1  vs. 
2/3),  menopausal  status,  ki67  expression  and  disease 
stage as classified by TNM classification system with 
controls; controls included 23 women with TP53 wild-
type breast cancer. All women were treated in a single 
Institute  at  the  Oncology  Department  of  “Alexandra” 
Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece. 
Immunohistochemical  (IHC)  analysis  was  performed 
to  quantify  expression  of  human  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptor  2  (HER2),  hormone  receptors  (HR) 
and  Ki67.  Estrogen  receptor  (ER)  and  progesterone 
receptor  (PR)  were  considered  positive  if  tumors  had 
more than 1% nuclear-stained cells. HER2 status was 
considered positive when graded as 3+, while 0 to 1+ 
were negative and 2+ was an inconclusive result and in 
situ hybridization (ISH) was performed in those cases 
to confirm positivity. Hormone receptor positive tumors 
characterized  by  ki67  expression  of  over  20%  were 
considered  as  luminal  B.  Information  on  histological 
characteristics (tumor subtype, grade, ER/PR expression, 
HER2 expression, expression levels of ki67), TNM stage 
(tumor size, lymph node infiltration, metastasis), type of 
surgery performed, type of chemotherapy administered, 
disease-free survival and overall survival were collected 
from patient files and were registered on an electronic 
database.  Both  cases  and  controls  were  Caucasian 
and  reside  in  the  same  geographical  region.  This 
case–control study is in accordance with the Helsinki 
Declaration and has been approved by the Review Board 
of Alexandra General Hospital of Athens. An informed 
consent  form  was  obtained  from  each  of  the  eligible 
patients.

DNA extraction

For breast cancer patients, paraffin-embedded breast 
tissues  derived  from  mastectomy  or  breast  conserving 
operation  before  adjuvant  treatment  and  blood  samples 
were  analyzed.  Paraffin-embedded  breast  tissues  were 
cut at slices of 10 μm diameter. Tumor DNA was isolated 
from paraffin-embedded breast tissues using the QIAamp 
DNA FFPE Tissue or the kit Ion Ampliseq Custom Next 
Generation  Sequencing  (NGS)  DNA  panel  (Amplicon 
Sequencing  following  the  manufacturer’s  instructions. 
Plasma blood samples were collected in Vacutainer tubes. 

Within 4 hours after collection, plasma was separated from 
whole blood samples through centrifugation for 10 min at 
3000 rpm at room temperature and stored at −80°C until 
further  use.  Isolation  of  plasma  DNA  was  performed 
using QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit and the genomic 
library was constructed using Trusight™ Comprehensive 
Hereditary  Cancer  Panel  –  Nextera™  DNA  Flex  Pre-
enrichment Library Prep according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.

Targeted sequencing

The NGS study on paraffin-embedded breast tissues 
was performed using Ion Torrent platform (Ion S5Prime) 
with  a  median  amplicon  cover  2000x  (whenever  DNA 
extraction was performed with kit Ion Ampliseq). For the 
data annotation and analysis IonReporter (v5.12) (Thermo 
Scientific) was used. The sequences were aligned to the 
human  genome  reference  sequence  GRCh37-hg19. 
An  additional  manual  data  curation  was  performed 
using data from OncomineReporter (v4.4) and relevant 
databases (CinVar, dbSNP, Ensemble, COSMIC, CIVIC, 
PharmGKB, OMIM, My Cancer Genome, Vasome etc.). 
For  the  tissues  that  underwent  DNA  extraction  via  the 
QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue, libraries were constructed 
using  AmpliSeq  for  Illumina  Comprehensive  Panel 
v3.  The  NGS  study  was  performed  using  the  Illumina 
platform (MiSeq, NextSeq500 or NovaSeq) in these cases 
with a median amplicon cover 500x for the 88.8% of the 
targeted regions. 

Plasma DNA sequencing 

Genomic libraries were constructed using Trusight™ 
Comprehensive  Hereditary  Cancer  Panel  –  Nextera™ 
DNA  Flex  Pre-enrichment  Library  Prep  according  to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  Plasma  sequencing 
was  performed  using  Illumina  platform  (NextSeq500/
NovaSeq).  The  validation  of  results  was  performed 
according  to  criteria  of  American  College  of  medical 
Genetics – ACMG [21] and NCCN guidelines. 

Statistical analysis 

The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  with 
SPSS  24.0  statistical  software.  Differences  between 
cases  and  controls  were  examined  by  Student’s  t-test 
for  continuous  variables  or  the  chi-square  test  for 
categorical variables. Pearson’s correlation and Fisher’s 
exact  test  (for  categorical  variables)  were  used.  The 
threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. 
Univariate  Cox  regression  analysis  was  performed  to 
evaluate the association of TP53 mutation with disease-
free  survival  in  breast  cancer  patients.  Kaplan–Meier 
survival curves were estimated to graphically represent 
the results.
