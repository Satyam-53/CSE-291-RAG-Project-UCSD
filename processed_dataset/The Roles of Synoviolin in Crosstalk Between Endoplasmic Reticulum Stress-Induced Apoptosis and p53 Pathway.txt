Endopalsmic	 reticulum	 (ER)	 is	 specialized	 organelle	 to	 maintain	 the	 integrity	 of	
secreted	and	membranous	proteins.	ER	also	senses	so‑called	“ER	stress”,	which	is	a	result

SYNovioliN iN er STreSS

Secreted and membranous proteins are modified in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
each  one  of  them  is  highly  quality  controlled  by  folding  of  newly  synthesized  proteins 
with ER resident chaperones (e.g., calnexin, calreticulin, GRP78, GRP94, protein disul-
fide  isomerase).1  If  the  influx  of  nascent  protein  is  more  than  the  folding  capacity  of 
ER,  nascent  peptide  chains  (unfolded  proteins)  accumulate  in  ER.2-3  Similarly,  glucose 
deprivation,  DNA  damage,  inhibition  of  N-linked  glycosylation  or  increase  in  protein 
synthesis can also perturb the proper post-translational modifications of nascent proteins.3 
The unfolded proteins produced under these conditions in the ER cause inverse effect on 
physiological homeostasis or protein integrity, a plight called the ER stress that is impli-
cated with variety kinds of human diseases. (For a review see refs. 2,4–7.)

It  is  demonstrated  that  ER  can  sense  the  stress  by  several  ER  resident  molecules  
(e.g., IRE1, PERK, ATF6).2-3 They also initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to 
adapt  various  internal  and  external  stresses  for  maintenance  of  protein  integrity.1-4 The 
ER stress induce phosphorylation of eIF2 α through the activation of the PERK, which 
results in attenuation of global translation to reduce the influx of proteins into ER and 
unfolded proteins.8 On the other hand, PERK-eIF2α kinase axis upregulates expression of 
pro-apoptotic protein, CHOP, via activation of transcriptional factor ATF4.9 ATF6, an ER 
resident transcriptional factor, is cleaved and translocates into nucleus to promote a group 
of stress inducible proteins including chaperones (e.g., Grp78, Grp97, protein disulphide 
isomerase)  and  transcription  factors  (XBP1).10-12  ATF6  was  also  proved  to  induce  the 
transcription of CHOP.13 An ER resident enzyme, IRE1, possesses dual catalytic domains 
as serine-threonine kinase and endoribonuclease, activates XBP1 by generating its splicing 
variant (active form), which also contributes to transcription of chaperons and other mole-
cule important for UPR and ERAD.2,12 IRE1 is also involved in polyglutamine-induced 
cell death by activating ASK 1 through formation of an IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex.14 
It is worthy to note that these molecules involved in UPR pathway have potential to carry 
out both prevention and promotion of apoptosis.

The  UPR  is  closely  related  with  another  homeostatic  mechanisms  in  ER  known  as 
ER associated degradation (ERAD), a system for disposal of the unfolded proteins.15-18 
The ERAD requires three steps, substrate transportation from the ER to the cytoplasm 
(dislocation),  ubiquitination  by  specific  ubiquitin  ligases  and  proteolysis  by  proteasome 
in cytoplasm.18 There are several ubiquitine ligase are reported involved in ERAD, and

Synoviolin Links p53 with ER Stress

Synoviolin  is  one  of  these  ER-resident  E3  ubiquitin  ligases.19-22 
Synoviolin  was  introduced  as  a  mammalian  homolog  of  Hrd1p/
Der3p that is inherent ubiquitin ligase for ERAD system. Misfolded 
carboxypeptide  yscY  (CPY*)  and  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coen-
zymeA reductase (HMGR), a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway 
in  yeast  are  known  substrate  for  Synoviolin.23-24  In  mammal, 
Synoviolin  seems  to  play  more  complicated  roles,  because  it  is 
essential for embryogenesis and suggested to be a pathogenic factor 
for  arthritis.19,25  The  synoviolin  homozygous  knock  out  mouse  is 
embryonic lethal due to severe anemia brought about by enhanced 
apoptosis  in  the  liver  where  the  embryonic  erythrogenesis  takes 
place.  Since  UPR,  such  as  the  induction  of  chaperon  proteins,  is 
not  impaired  in  the  knock  out  mice,  the  sole  disruption  of  ERAD 
system in the mice can cause ER stress-induced apoptosis when the 
protein synthesis rapidly increases to build up fetal erythrogenesis in 
the liver.25 The heterozygous knock out mouse can survive and show 
no  phenotype  in  appearance,  however,  the  mouse  shows  remark-
able  resistance  to  experimental  arthritis  model,  which  is  induced 
by  immunization  of  type  II  collagen  (collagen  induced  arthritis: 
CIA).19,25  Histological  analyses  demonstrate  that  the  hyperplasia 
of  the  synovial  tissue  is  suppressed  in  the  mouse,  which  is  usually 
observed in the CIA-induced wild type mice. Interestingly, enhanced 
apoptosis  is  detected  in  the  synovial  tissue  of  the  CIA-induced 
heterozygous  knock  out  mouse,  indicating  an  important  role  of 
Synoviolin in antagonizing the apoptotic pathway. Contrary to this, 
Synoviolin  overexpressing  mouse  exhibits  overgrowth  of  synovial 
tissue that resembles rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common chronic 
inflammatory  joint  disease  in  human.19  In  addition,  the  evidences 
that  Synoviolin  prevents  ER  stress  induced  apoptosis  in  cultured 
cells support the idea that Synoviolin is an anti-apoptotic factor in 
mammals  probably  due  to  protecting  the  cells  from  ER  stress.19,21 
Based  on  these  data,  we  proposed  one  pathogenic  status  with 
Synoviolin  overexpression  as  “Hyper-ERAD”,  which  might  allow 
excess elimination of unfolded proteins and provide the cell with ER 
stress free condition.19,26 It is estimated that 30 to 40% of the newly 
synthesized proteins failed to be folded properly in ER, which means 
most of the cells are facing at risk of ER stress unless enough ERAD 
constitutively clears these constantly produced unfolded proteins.27 
Since  the  positive  correlation  is  known  between  ERAD  and  the 
production of secretory proteins, hyper-ERAD may allow the cell to 
over-produce secretary proteins.28 A cell equipped with hyper-ERAD 
could be very refractory to ER stress, because unfolded proteins can 
be promptly eliminated by the equipped system even if the protein 
synthesis is upregulated or the environment becomes stressful for ER. 
When the cells become free from unfolded proteins, it is possible that 
UPR triggered translational attenuation or apoptosis signal are shut 
down. These phenotypes that might be resulted from hyper-ERAD 
(e.g.,  increased  protein  production,  anti-apoptotic)  are  similar 
to  the  hallmarks  of  the  proliferating  diseases  including  neoplasm  
and arthritis.

The  mechanisms  for  the  ER  stress-induced  apoptosis  remain 
enigmatic,  however,  recent  reports  have  succeeded  to  illustrate 
some  pathways  in  the  ER  stress  induced  apoptosis  (reviewed 
in  refs.  29–32).  ER  resident  caspase  (caspase-12  in  mouse  and 
probably  caspase-4  in  human)  is  suggested  to  be  activated  in  ER 
stress-induced apoptosis, even though their roles in human are still 
under  debate.33,34  One  of  the  most  characterized  pathways  in  ER

stress-induced apoptosis is carried out through BCL2 family proteins. 
The first report related with this pathway demonstrated the protec-
tive effect of BCL2 overexpression or Bax and Bak deficiency against 
ER stress-induced apoptosis.35-37 Furthermore, BCL2 is inhibited by 
CHOP,  which  is  transcriptionally  induced  by  PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 
pathway  and  post-translationaly  activated  by  kinase  pathway  origi-
nated from IRE1-TRAF2 complex on ER after ER stress.9,13,38 The 
other members of the BH3-only BCL-2 family proteins, PUMA and 
Noxa, have been identified as the pro-apoptotic molecules induced 
by ER stress.39,40 Consistent with these facts, the activation of p53 
is also observed in the ER stress, because both PUMA and Noxa are 
the evident transcriptional targets of p53.40-42 However, the ER stress 
induced p53 activation is not straight forward, namely a mild or a 
short time ER stress tends to inhibit p53 dependent apoptosis and a 
severe or a long time stress promote it.40,43,44

The  findings  from  Koromilas  and  our  lab  provide  the  evidence 
for  striking  mechanism  in  p53  regulation  at  ER  (Fig.  1).43-45  Qu 
et  al.  proved  that  ER  stress  inhibits  p53  dependent  apoptosis. The 
critical step for p53 suppression is accomplished by phosphorylation 
of p53 at serine 315 and 376 by glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK3 
b).43,44 The  mechanism  how  the  kinase  is  activated  after  ER  stress 
remains  unclear,  but  the  C-terminus  phosphorylation  of  p53  by 
the kinase exhibits remarkable inhibitory effect on nuclear localiza-
tion and stabilization of p53 in cooperation with Hdm2, one of the 
most  important  negative  regulators  for  p53.46  On  the  other  hand, 
we  introduced  Synoviolin  as  a  potent  negative  regulator  of  p53.45 
Synoviolin  can  cytoplasmically  capture  p53  on  ER  and  degrade  it 
by  ubiquitin-proteasome  system.  Synoviolin  is  totally  independent 
of  known  p53  regulating  ubiquitin  ligases  such  as  Hmd2,  Pirh2, 
Cop1  or  Parc  in  this  process.45,46 The  importance  of  Synoviolin  is 
underlined  by  the  fact  that  the  steady  state  level  of  p53  protein  is 
strictly regulated by Synoviolin, because the half life of p53 protein 
is  markedly  prolonged  in  human  cell  line  by  siRNA  for  synoviolin 
as  well  as  in  the  embryonic  fibroblasts  from  synoviolin  knock  out 
mouse.45  Since  Synoviolin  is  known  to  be  upregulated  by  IRE  or 
ATF6, it can be said that the ER stress also indirectly dampen p53 
through  an  ER  resident  ubiquitin ligase,  Synoviolin.21  Both  GSK3 
b  and  Synoviolin  pathways  invite  the  same  consequences  of  p53, 
cytoplasmic  localization  and  degradation  in  there,  which  might

ASK1-JNK  pathway.12,50 The  severity  or  the  duration  of  ER  stress 
seems to determine the down stream pathway of IRE1. It is expected 
that  severely  damaged  cells  by  ER  stress  could  produce  unfolded 
proteins  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  systemic  cells,  therefore  it  is 
reasonable to change its roles from anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic as 
the cell damage becomes more severe. As mentioned before, the activity 
of p53 under ER stress also fluctuates according to the level of the 
stress. It seems that a mild ER stress de-stabilizes p53, but a severe one 
activates it.40,43,44 The mechanism that determine the activity of p53 
has not been fully figured out experimentally, however, previous data 
may unravel it by describing in detail the regulation and the function 
of Synoviolin under ER stress (Fig. 2). In unstressed cell, Synoviolin 
is thought to regulates steady state levels of p53 by sequestering and 
ubiquitinating it for proteasomal degradation in cytoplasm, because 
Synoviolin knocking down by siRNA clearly satbilizes the p53.45 In 
the mild ER stress condition, Synoviolin is transcriptionally upregu-
lated by IRE or ATF6 activation and the increased Synoviolin plays 
its  canonical  role  in  ERAD.19-22  If  the  expression  of  Synoviolin  is 
induced more than that is required to eliminate unfolded proteins, 
the free Synoviolin may capture more p53 than they do in unstressed 
cell.  As  a  result,  a  mild  ER  stress  may  achieve  p53  suppression  
(Fig.  2B). When  a  severe  or  a  prolonged  ER  stress  takes  place,  the 
unfolded proteins can exceed the capacity of upregulated Synoviolin. 
The overwhelming unfolded proteins may squelch Synoviolin and let 
it to liberate p53 for activation (Fig. 2C). This scenario can explain, 
at least in part, why p53 change its behavior according to the severity 
of ER stress.

ER  stress  has  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  in  human 
diseases.2,4-7  Disruption  of  physiological  UPR  and/or  ERAD  or 
abnormal  conformation  of  proteins  have  been  demonstrated  in  a 
variety  of  human  diseases  including  Alzheimer  disease,  Parkinson 
disease,  neuronal  damage  by  ischemia,  prion  disease,  cystic  fibrosis 
and  diabetes  mellitus.  The  cause  of  these  degenerative  changes  in 
the  diseases  is  explained  by  aberrant  ER  stress-induced  apoptosis 
in the affected organs. Contrary to this, we would like to propose a 
novel model for proliferative diseases such as tumor or RA, which is 
also a hypothesis reply to an interesting question, “what will happen 
to  cells  if  they  are  completely  free  from  ER  stress?”  As  previously 
described,  Synoviolin  has  two  functions,  one  is  for  ERAD  and 
the  other  is  for  p53  blockade.  Given  that  Synvoiolin  is  aberrantly 
upregulated in cells as shown in Figure 2D, they could provide the 
cells  an  ability  to  over-secrete  and  overgrow,  because  overexpressed 
Synoviolin  will  unburden  the  cells  from  ER  stress  by  eliminating 
the  unfolded  protein  even  in  the  hostile  milieu  surrounding  the 
cells  such  as  hypoxia  and/or  starvation.  In  addition,  ER  stress  free 
cells may be allowed to produce the harmful amount of secretary or 
membranous protein. Those acquired property will help the cells to 
proliferate, destruct and invade into surrounding tissues. The over-
expressed Synoviolin is also expected to sequester p53 in cytoplasm 
and degrade it, which may rescues cells that are supposed to commit 
apoptosis.  In  this  regard,  our  analyses  about  synoviolin  promoter 
make the hypothesis plausible. The Ets binding site (EBS) is deter-
mined to be the crucial site for synoviolin transcription in vivo and 
in vitro, and GABP, a transcription factor known to be down stream 
of MAP kinases such as JNK and ERK, is proved to be bind to it.51 
The MAP kinase signals are activated in both neoplasm and RA, thus 
these signal may induce constitutively high expression of Synoviolin 
in  these  diseases.52,53  Similar  pathogenic  mechanism  for  neoplasm 
progression has been actually implicated in a human disease. There 
is  a  clinical  evidence  that  XBP-1  is  highly  upregulated  in  multiple

help to gain times for chaperones to refold the unfolded proteins to 
restore their ER functions before apoptosis is induced in these cells. 
The aberrant cytoplasmic localization of p53 are described in human 
cancers, thus the ER stress initiated p53 inhibition by Synoviolin or 
GSK3  b  could  be  the  mechanism  how  p53  is  sequestered  in  cyto-
plasm of these cancers.47,48 The milieu surrounding neoplasm cells 
also  support  this  idea,  namely  the  stressful  external  environment 
may give mild ER stress to tumor cells, and help to inhibit p53 by 
activating Synoviolin or GSK3 b. Actually, ER stress is demonstrated 
by the activation of ER stress inducible molecules in human tumor 
and arthritis.19,49 On this point of view, blockade of Synoviolin or 
GSK3 b can be applied for adjuvant therapy for neoplasm therapy or 
arthritis through p53 activation.

production  of  monoclonal  immunoglobin  or  Bence  Jones  proteins 
(reviewed in ref. 4). It is important that proteasomal inhibitors have 
been proved to be effective to this disease, indicating accumulation 
of unfolded proteins by proteasome blockade affect the proliferation 
of  neoplasmic  cells.  Our  speculation  is  that  the  increased  unfolded 
proteins  act  as  an  inhibitor  for  Synoviolin  and  p53  is  released  and 
activated in proteasome inhibitor treated cells. Likewise, the therapy 
targeting  Synoviolin  could  be  a  good  strategy  for  the  proliferative 
diseases refractory to the conventional treatment.

coNcluSioN

ER  integrates  many  kinds  of  stresses  and  initiates  a  variety  of 
signalings to adapt to the stresses. Among them, apoptosis pathway 
has become an important topic for its definite pathogenic potential 
in  human  diseases.  P53,  one  of  the  most  important  molecules  in 
tumor, has become a novel mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis. 
It  also  can  be  said  that  ER  regulates  p53  pathway,  because  the  ER 
specific stresses or molecules seem to play some roles in p53 regula-
tion. We discuss about the dual role of Synoviolin on ER, one is the 
ERAD and the other is p53 inhibition in cytoplasm. In this regard, 
Synoviolin may upregulate two aspects of proliferative diseases, over-
production  of  secretory  proteins  and  resistance  to  apoptosis.  Both 
expression level and its enzyme activity of Synoviolin are required for 
ERAD and p53 regulation, the blockade of Synoviolin expression or 
activity  may  ameliorate  the  proliferative  diseases  such  as  neoplasm 
and  RA.  Further  research  is  necessary  to  answer  the  important  
questions about the roles of Synoviolin in ER stress induced apop-
tosis. Does hyper-ERAD status really exist in human diseases? Can a 
specific inhibitor against Synoviolin cause p53 activation, and induce 
apoptosis  of  target  cells?  We  hope  that  the  continuous  attempt  to 
unveil the ER mediated apoptotic pathway will help to develop the 
new therapeutic approach to the refractory diseases.
