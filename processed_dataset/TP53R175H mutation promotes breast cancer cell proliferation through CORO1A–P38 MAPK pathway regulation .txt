Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Among all types, triple-negative breast cancer is 
particularly  challenging  to  cure  because  of  its  high  recurrence  rates  and  invasive  and  metastatic  capacity. 
Although numerous studies have explored the role of TP53 mutations in cancer, there is a dearth of research 
regarding the correlation between TP53 mutations and breast cancer cell proliferation. In this study, our aim was 
to examine the impact of TP53 mutations on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer bioinformatics tech-
niques. To detect cell proliferation, a CCK8 assay was performed, and western blotting was used to identify the 
expression of p53, p38, and p-p38 proteins. Cellular mRNA sequencing was used to screen target genes of TP53 
mutations,  and  molecular docking  was  performed  to  identify  the  drugs  that  could  hinder the  proliferation  of 
breast  cancer  cells.The  results  showed  that  the  TP53  mutation  rate  is  higher  in  patients  with  triple-negative 
breast cancer than non-triple-negative breast cancer, and those with TP53 mutations tended to have a poorer 
prognosis  than  those  without. Patients  with  R175H  site  mutations  also  had  shorter  survival  times  than  those 
without. Cytological experiments revealed that the TP53R175H  mutation increases the rate of breast cancer cell 
proliferation. In conjunction with this, CORO1A was found to be a downstream target of TP53 mutations, and it 
was determined to promote breast cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, CORO1A overexpression resulted in the 
downregulation  of  p-p38  levels.  Molecular  docking  studies  further  revealed  that  tea  polyphenols  can  inhibit 
breast cancer proliferation by binding to p53.   

1. Introduction 

cancer. 

Worldwide,  female  breast  cancer  has  recently  become  the  most 
commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020, with an estimated 2.3 million new 
cases (11.7 %) [1]. Among them, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a 
subtype  with  high  invasive  and  metastatic  capacity,  frequent  recur-
rence, and a poor prognosis, accounts for 12–18 % of breast cancer cases 
[2]. At present, breast cancer treatment mainly includes surgical treat-
ment,  chemotherapy,  radiotherapy,  and  endocrine  therapy,  among 
others  [3–5].  However,  for  malignant  breast  cancers,  such  as  triple- 
negative breast cancer, less than 30 % of patients experienced verified 
objective  responses  with  precision  medication  [6].  Therefore,  it  is 
crucial to explore new therapeutic strategies for triple-negative breast 

TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, is mutated in approximately half of 
all  malignant  tumors,  including  breast,  colon,  lung,  and  liver  cancer, 
among others [7]. Previous studies have demonstrated that TP53 mu-
tations are involved in the progression of various tumors. For example, 
in colorectal cancer, the p53-R273H mutation enhances the stemness of 
colorectal  cancer  by  regulating  specific  lncRNAs  [8],  and  the  p53- 
R248Q mutation can upregulate REGγ expression to promote endome-
trial cancer [9]. In breast cancer, several studies have already demon-
strated that TP53 mutations can serve as promising biomarkers [10,11] 
and therapeutic targets for patients [12,13], particularly those with the 
triple-negative subtype [14]. However, the exact role of TP53 mutations 
in breast cancer remains unclear.

Su et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Recently,  polyphenols,  the  predominant  active  compounds  in  tea, 
have been identified with strong antioxidant and anticancer properties, 
particularly in patients receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy [15]. 
Existing  studies  have  shown  that  they  can  effectively  prevent  lung, 
esophageal, stomach, liver, and prostate cancer [16–20]. However, the 
potential of tea polyphenols to be used as therapeutic agents for breast 
cancer  and  their  possible  association  with  TP53  mutations  remains 
unclear. 

In this study, we aimed to identify the effects of TP53 hotspot mu-
tations on breast cancer cell proliferation. We further screened crucial 
targets associated with the function of TP53 mutations and investigated 
how these alterations regulate breast cancer cell proliferation. We also 
aimed to address the questions of whether tea polyphenols can serve as 
therapeutic agents and their effect on TP53-mutated breast cancer. 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Reagents and antibodies 

Adezmapimod hydrochloride, SB203580 (SB) were purchased from 
Med Chem Express (HY-10256A, NJ, USA), and tea polyphenols were 
obtained from Meilunbio (MB5041-1, Dalian, China). 

The  primary  antibodies  included  p53  antibody  (AF0879,  Affinity 
Biosciences, US), p38 antibody (BS3566, bioworld, Nanjing, China), p- 
p38 antibody (BS4635, bioworld, Nanjing, China), CORO1A Antibody 
(A04245-2, Boster, Wuhan, China), and anti-GAPDH (BM1623, Boster, 
Wuhan, China). The Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was ob-
tained from Boster Biological Technology (BA1054, Wuhan, China). 

2.2. Cell culture 

ZR-75-1  cells  (CL-0247,  Pricella,  Wuhan,  China)  were  cultured  in 
vitro in RPMI-1640 medium (C11875500BT, Gibco, USA). The medium 
was  supplemented  with  10  %  fetal  bovine  serum  (BI,  USA)  and  1  % 
penicillin/streptomycin  (T1300,  Solarbio,  Beijing,  China).  MCF-10A 
cells (CL-0525; Pricella, Wuhan, China) were cultured in an MCF 10A 
cell-specific medium (CM-0525, Pricella, Wuhan, China). All cell types 
were grown at 37 

C with 5 % CO2. 

◦

2.3. Expression of Ki-67 protein 

We  reviewed  123  patients  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  at  the 
Tangshan Maternal and Child Health Hospital between 2019 and 2020. 
We also compiled and statistically analyzed Ki-67 protein expression in 
samples  from  these  patients.  This  study  was  approved  by  the  Ethics 
Committee of Tangshan Maternal and Child Health Hospital (2022-063- 
01). 

2.4. Western blot assay 

A polyacrylamide gel was used to separate total proteins, which were 
then  electrotransferred  to  polyvinylidene  fluoride  membranes.  After 
incubating the membranes in 5 % skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, 
◦
they were incubated overnight at 4 
C with the primary antibody. After 
three washes in 1 × TBST (T1082, Solarbio, Beijing, China), membranes 
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG 
secondary  antibody  and  then  washed  again.  ECL  Plus  Hypersensitive 
Luminescence  Solution  (AR1197,  Boster,  Wuhan,  China)  was  used  to 
identify the protein signals. 

2.5. Lentivirus transfection 

To generate p53 wild-type breast cancer cells (ZR-75-1) and normal 
breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) expressing the p53-R175H mutation, 
we obtained p53-R175H-mutated lentiviral particles (H17853, pSLenti- 
EF1-mCherry-P2A-Puro-CMV-TP53(R175H)-3  × FLAG-WPRE)  and 

control  lentiviral  particles  (GL123,  pSLenti-EF1-mCherry-P2A-Puro- 
CMV-MCS-3 × FLAG-WPRE) from OBiO (Shanghai, China), which were 
transfected into these cells. ZR-75-1 and MCF-10A cells were infected 
according to the manufacturer’s recommended multiplicity of infection 
value of 10:1. To overexpress the CORO1A gene, we constructed lenti-
viral  particles  (CORO1A,  LPP-M0030-Lv105-100),  which  were  from 
Gene  Copoeia  (Guangzhou,  China),  and  control  lentiviral  particles 
(negative  Control,  LPP-NEG-Lv105-  050)  were  simultaneously  trans-
fected into the p53-R175H mutant-expressing cells. 

2.6. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay 

CCK8 was used to evaluate cell proliferation. MCF-10A (4,000 cells/ 
well)  and  ZR-75-1  (40,000  cells/well)  cells  were  seeded  in  a  96-well 
plate.  We  incubated  the  cells  for  24,  48,  72,  and  96  h,  and  then,  we 
added  10  μL  of  CCK8  to  each  well  and  incubated  the  plate  for  1  h. 
Finally, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Additionally, the CCK8 
assay can be used to explore the inhibition and survival rates of the drug 
in cells. The inhibition rate formula was as follows: inhibition rate =
[(control wells (cid:0)

test wells)]/(control wells (cid:0) blank wells)] × 100. 

2.7. mRNA sequencing 

To  extract  total  RNA  from  the  cells,  the  cells  were  first  observed 
under  a  microscope  to  confirm  their  integrity  (ruptured  cells  release 
RNAase to degrade RNA). The adherent cells were washed twice with 
pre-chilled 1 × PBS, and the appropriate amount of lysate TRIpure Re-
agent (332131AX, Aidlab, Beijing, China), and the amount of TRIpure 
were determined according to the area of the culture plate (1 mL per 10 
cm2). The extracted RNA was sent to Personal Bio (Nanjing, China) for 
mRNA sequencing. 

2.8. Bioinformatics analysis 

After logging into the cBioPortal website (https://www.cbioportal. 
org/),  we  selected  8905  samples  from  22  studies,  including  adenoid 
cystic carcinoma of the breast (MSK, J Pathol. 2015) and breast cancer 
(HTAN,  2022  and  METABRIC,  Nature  2012  &  Nat  Commun  2016), 
among  others.  Finally,  we  entered  “TP53″  to  determine  the  mutation 
status  of  TP53  in  breast  cancer  and  the  survival  status  of  patients. 
Sample information regarding TP53 mutations in these samples and the 
mutation counts in triple-negative breast cancer and non-triple-negative 
breast  cancer  was  downloaded.  Using  the  GEPIA2  (https://gepia2. 
cancer-pku.cn/#index)  website,  we  obtained  the  overall  survival 
curve for TP53 in breast cancer. For the survival analysis, with respect to 
mutations  in  specific  locations,  we  used  the  LinkedOmic  database 
(https://www.linkedomics.org/login.php).  The  level  of  p53  protein 
expression in breast cancer was evaluated using the UALCAN database. 
First,  the  UALCAN  database  website  was  accessed  and  CPTAC  was 
clicked to enter a new page. On the new page, the gene name for the 
desired protein level was inputted in the “Enter gene name(s)” interface. 
In the “CPTAC dataset” section, “Breast cancer” was selected, and in the 
“Links for analysis” section, “Total Protein” was chosen. Finally, “Major 
subclass” was selected to obtain statistical graphs and results. 

2.9. Molecular docking 

First,  we  prepared  the  structural  files  of  the  proteins  and  small 
molecules before docking. The 3D structures of the small molecules were 
obtained from the PubChem database, and the protein structures were 
derived from the PDB database. After preparing the protein and small 
molecule  structures,  both  the  ligand  and  receptor  structures  were 
opened  in  AutoDockTools  to  generate  docking  boxes.  Finally,  “Run 
AutoDock Vina” was executed to perform molecular docking. By default, 
10 docking results were obtained.

2.10. Statistical analysis 

Data were expressed as the mean ± SD and analyzed using GraphPad 
Prism software. Analyses between two groups were performed based on 
a  two-tailed  Student’s  t-test.  One-way  analysis  of  variance  (One  Way 
ANOVA) was used to compare differences in terms of the influence of 
one  independent  variable  or  factor.  Two-factor  ANOVA  was  used  to 
analyze cases of two-factor influence. An independent sample t-test was 
used for both groups. Analysis of the association between two or more 
sample  rates  (composition  ratio)  and  two  categorical  variables  was 
performed using the chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered a statis-
tically significant difference. 

3. Results 

3.1. TP53 mutations in breast cancer 

We analyzed the rate of TP53 gene mutations in tumors using the 
data  from  cBioPortal  database  and  observed  that  this  varied  across 
multiple cancer types, with the lowest mutation rate in thyroid cancer 
(2.08 %), the highest mutation rate in ovarian cancer (97.27 %), and a 
mutation rate of 50.23 % in breast cancer (Fig. 1a). To understand TP53 
mutations  in  different  types  of  breast  cancer,  we  divided  the  3489 
samples in the cBioPortal database into triple-negative and non-triple- 
negative (positive for at least one of ER, PR, and Her-2 protein) breast 
cancer.  We  found  that  the  mutation  rate  in  non-TNBC  was  25.13  %, 
whereas that in TNBC was 78.45 %. The results also showed that breast 

cancer cells proliferate more rapidly in patients with TNBC (Fig. 1c). 

To gain a better understanding of the role of TP53 in breast cancer 
survival, we compared patients with breast cancer carrying high and low 
TP53  gene  expression  using  the  GEPIA2  website,  and  patients  with 
higher TP53 expression had poorer survival rates (Fig. 1d). Based on the 
data  from  the  cBioPortal  database,  among  4954  patients  with  breast 
cancer carrying TP53 mutations had shorter survival times (P < 0.001) 
on  examining  the  overall  survival  time  (in  months)  (Fig.  1e).  Addi-
tionally, we examined the progression-free survival periods (measured 
in months) of 135 patients with breast cancer and found that those with 
TP53 mutations had shorter survival times (P < 0.001). 

3.2. Analysis of TP53 mutations and expression in breast cancer 

Using all samples from 22 breast cancer databases compiled on the 
website cBioPortal, TP53 mutation loci were analyzed. Mutations were 
found in 3078 samples, including 1785 missense mutations, 977 trun-
cating mutations, 223 splice mutations, 90 in-frame mutations and three 
SV/fusion mutations. The mutations with the highest frequencies were 
R248W,  R175H,  and  R273H  (Fig.  2a).  The  survival  times  of  patients 
with  breast  cancer  carrying  these  three  common  mutations  (R248W, 
R175H, and R273H) and patients with breast cancer but without mu-
tations  were  analyzed  using  the  LinkedOmics  database.  The  results 
revealed that patients with breast cancer with the R175H mutation locus 
had shorter survival times than those without (Fig. 2b, c, and d). 

TP53 functions are primarily mediated by the p53 protein; therefore, 
we  investigated  expression  of  the  p53  protein  in  cases  of  TP53

mutations. First, the UALCAN database was used to evaluate expression 
levels  of  the  p53  protein  in  breast  cancer  using  a  clinical  proteomics 
tumor  analysis  dataset.  The  expression  levels  of  p53  were  higher  in 
samples from patients with TNBC than in samples from patients without 
TNBC (P < 0.05; Fig. 2e). We also used TP53-mutant cells (MDA-MB- 
231, SK-BR-3), TP53-nonsense-mutant cells (HCC1937 cells), and cells 
without  such  mutations  (MCF-10A,  ZR-75-1,  MCF-7)  for  western  blot 
assays and found that the expression of p53 varied among these cells 
(Fig.  2f).  Specifically,  p53  was  substantially  expressed  only  in  breast 
cancer cells with mutations. Breast cancer cells with wild-type TP53 (ZR- 
75-1)  and  normal  breast  cancer  epithelial  cells  (MCF-10A)  were  then 
transfected with the TP53R175H-mutant plasmid. The lentiviral particles 
used for transfection contained the puromycin resistance gene, and the 
successful cells were selected by puromycin deletion. In order to visually 
assess  the  transfection  efficiency,  we  employed  mCherry  fluorescent 
labelling (Fig. 2g-j), and the expression of p53 was determined through 
western blot assays (Fig. 2k, l). Here, p53 was highly expressed in both 
breast cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 and normal breast cancer 
epithelial cells when they were transfected with the gene variant. 

3.3. TP53R175H  regulates cell proliferation through the P38 mitogen- 
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway 

The  proliferation  of  MCF-10A  and  ZR-75-1  cells  following  trans-
fection with the TP53R175H  variant was evaluated using CCK8 tests to 
determine the corresponding effect on breast cancer cells. In this study, 
cells were separated into three groups, including the control (untrans-
fected cells), p53-R175H (cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant), 
and NC (cells transfected with an empty lentiviral vector). The results 
revealed that the proliferation rate of cells in the p53-R175H group was 

significantly higher than that in the control and NC groups (Fig. 3a–d, P 
< 0.01). 

Given that abnormalities in the inflammatory pathway can promote 
tumor  development,  we  determined  whether  the  TP53R175H  mutation 
would affect the P38 MAPK inflammatory pathway. The expression of 
p38  and  phosphorylated  p38  proteins  in  MCF-10A  and  ZR-75-1  cells 
transfected with the TP53R175H  variant was detected by western blot-
ting, and the cells were divided into control, p53-R175H, and NC groups. 
The results showed that the expression levels of p38 and phosphorylated 
p38 proteins were increased with TP53R175H transfection (Fig. 3e–h). 

To further investigate the effect of P38 MAPK pathway activation on 
the  proliferation  of  breast  cancer  cells,  we  utilized  a  P38  inhibitor 
SB203580 based on different concentrations (100 nM, 1 μM, and 10 μM) 
to inhibit expression of the p-p38 protein, with western blotting exper-
iments conducted to detect this (Fig. 3i–l). The control group comprised 
MCF-10A  and  ZR-75-1  cells  transfected  with  the  TP53R175H  variant, 
whereas  the  experimental  group  included  cells  transfected  with  the 
TP53R175H  variant incubated with P38 inhibitor SB203580 at different 
concentrations (100 nM, 1 μM, and 10 μM) for 24 h. After detecting the 
expression of p38 and p-p38 proteins through western blot experiments 
and  confirming  that  the  P38  inhibitor,  at  these  concentrations,  could 
effectively reduce p-p38 protein levels, we performed CCK8 experiments 
to determine its inhibitory effect on MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells trans-
fected with the TP53R175H variant. The data revealed that the rate of cell 
inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of the selective P38 
pathway inhibitor (Fig. 3m, n).

proliferation, we transfected ZR-75-1 cells with this variant. The cells 
were divided into three groups, the control (untransfected cells), p53- 
R175H  (cells  transfected  with  the  TP53R175H  variant),  and  NC  (cells 
transfected  with  an  empty  lentiviral  vector).  Each  group  underwent 
three  rounds  of  repeated  transfections,  and  mRNA  sequencing  was 
performed  on  all  three  cell  groups.  An  analysis  of  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms  in  the  sequencing  results  revealed  that  in  the  p53- 
R175H  group,  the  nucleotide  at  position  chr17:7675088  (GRCh38. 
p14) was changed from C to T. To visually confirm the success of ZR-75- 
1 cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant, we performed IGV visu-
alization  analysis (Fig.  4a). Furthermore,  cluster analysis of  the  three 
cell groups illustrated that the p53-R175H group displayed significant 
changes  in  mRNA  expression  relative  to  those  in  the  control  and  NC 
groups (Fig. 4b). 

Using GO enrichment analysis, we discovered that the GO term “cell 

population  proliferation”  was  significantly  enriched  (P  = 0.000296) 
through  a  comparison  of  the  p53-R175H  group  and  control  (Fig.  4c) 
groups. Similarly, a comparison between the p53-R175H and NC groups 
also showed the significant enrichment of “cell population proliferation” 
(P = 0.046504; Fig. 4d). However, there was no significant enrichment 
of this term (P = 0.386039823332065) when comparing the control and 
NC  (Fig.  4e)  groups.  GO  enrichment  analysis  revealed  a  decrease  in 
COR1A expression in the cell population proliferation pathway in the 
p53-R175H group relative to  that in the  control  and NC  groups (P <
0.05;  Fig.  4f).  To  further  verify  that  TP53  affects  CORO1A  protein 
expressed, via modulation of the CORO1A gene, when the R175H mu-
tation is present, we divided MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells into control 
(untransfected cells), p53-R175H (cells transfected with the TP53R175H 
variant), and NC (cells transfected with empty lentiviral vector) groups 
after transfection and examined the expression of the coronin 1A protein

by  performing  western  blotting.  The  results  revealed  that  coronin  1A 
protein expression was decreased in the p53-R175H group (Fig. 4g–j; P 
< 0.01). 

3.5. Coronin 1A protein promotes cell proliferation by regulating the P38 
MAPK pathway 

To  explore  the  effect  of  coronin  1A  protein  on  breast  cancer  cell 
proliferation,  we  transfected  CORO1A-overexpressing  lentiviral  parti-
cles  into  MCF-10A  and  ZR-75-1  cells  and  divided  the  cells  into  p53- 
R175H  (blank  group:  cells  transfected  with  only  the  TP53R175H 
variant),  p53-R175H-CORO1A  (cells  transfected  with  the  TP53R175H 
variant  and  overexpressing  the  CORO1A  gene),  and  p53-R175H-NC 
(empty  lentivirus-expressing  cells  transfected  with  the  TP53R175H 
variant)  groups.  The  expression  of  coronin  1A  protein  in  the  three 
groups of cells after transfection was examined by performing western 
blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 5e and g. Transfection was suc-
cessful in obtaining TP53R175H  variant-expressing cells overexpressing 
CORO1A. 

After  obtaining  TP53R175H-expressing  cells  with  CORO1A  over-
expression, we explored their proliferation using CCK8 assays. We found 
that  with  coronin  1A  protein  overexpression  (p53-R175H-CORO1A 
group),  the  TP53R175H-expressing  cells  proliferated  more  slowly  than 
those  without  overexpression  (Fig.  5a–d).  This  indicated  that  high 
coronin 1A protein expression inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer 
cells. 

To explore whether coronin 1A regulates the P38 MAPK pathway, we 
used western blotting to detect the expression of P38 MAPK pathway 
proteins in cells from the p53-R175H, p53-R175H-CORO1A, and p53- 
R175H-NC groups. The results showed that the expression of p38 and 
p-p38 proteins was lower in the p53-R175H-CORO1A group than in the 
p53-R175H  and  p53-R175H-NC  groups,  and  these  differences  were 
statistically significant (Fig. 5e–h, P < 0.05). Therefore, we concluded 
that  the  TP53R175H  mutation  promotes  activation  of  the  P38  MAPK 
pathway by suppressing coronin 1A protein expression. 

3.6. Tea polyphenols inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by promoting 
coronin 1A protein expression 

To demonstrate that TP53R175H inhibition could suppress the effects 
on coronin 1A expression, molecular docking was performed, exploring 
whether  tea  polyphenols  could  block  the  inhibition  of  coronin  1A  by 
binding  to  the  mutant  protein  encoded  by  TP53R175H.  Results  of  the 
prediction revealed that catechins, the major components of tea poly-
phenols,  can  bind  to  p53.  The  main  catechins  included  epicatechin, 
epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate, with 
maximum binding energies for docking of 7, 7, 6.7, and 7.7 kcal/mol 
respectively (Fig. 6a–d). 

We then verified the predicted molecular docking results. First, we 
used different concentrations of tea polyphenols (50, 100, and 200 μg/ 
mL) to treat MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells of the p53-R175H group and 
performed western blot assays to simultaneously examine protein levels 
in  the  control  (untransfected  cells),  p53-R175H  (cells  with  the 
TP53R175H  variant without tea polyphenol intervention), and NC (cells 
transfected with the empty lentiviral vector) groups, as well as in cells 
expressing  p53-R175H  treated  with  different  concentrations  of  tea 
polyphenols. Expression of the coronin 1A protein was found to increase 
with increasing concentrations of tea polyphenols, and these differences 
were statistically significant (Fig. 6e–h, P ≤ 0.05). 

To  explore  the  inhibitory  effect  of  tea  polyphenols  on  TP53R175H- 
mutant breast cancer cell proliferation, we further performed CCK8 as-
says  using  MCF-10A  and  ZR-75-1  cells  expressing  p53-R175H.  These 
cells were treated with different concentrations of tea polyphenols (50, 
100, and 200 μg/mL). The rate of TP53R175H-mutant breast cancer cell 
proliferation  suppression  increased  with  higher  concentrations  and 
longer durations of tea polyphenol treatment, especially at 100 μg/mL, 

which resulted in the highest inhibition rate (Fig. 6i, j). 

4. Discussion 

TP53 mutations are commonly observed in tumors, and the findings 
of  this  study  corroborate  that  their  frequency  varies  across  different 
tumor  types.  The  lowest  mutation  rate  was  found  in  thyroid  cancer 
(2.08 %), the highest mutation rate was in ovarian cancer (97.27 %), and 
the TP53 mutation rate in breast cancer was 50.23 %. Moreover, TP53 
mutations are correlated with tumor malignancy; for example, small cell 
lung  cancer  [21,22],  high-grade  serous  ovarian  cancer  [23],  and 
esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [24]  can exhibit  TP53  mutation 
rates greater than 80 %. This study also showed that TP53 mutation rate 
in TNBC was 78.45 %, which was significantly higher than that in non- 
TNBC. Based on the results of this study, there could be a relationship 
between TP53 mutations and TNBC. 

Mutations  in  TP53  not  only  impair  the  anti-tumor  activity  of  the 
encoded protein, but also cause the mutated p53 protein to develop new 
oncogenic characteristics. Such mutations promote the survival of can-
cer cells and are linked to an ineffective treatment response and unfa-
vorable  prognosis  [25].  The  experimental  results  also  indicated  that 
patients with TP53 mutations have shorter overall and progression-free 
survival times than those without these mutations. In addition, patients 
with high tumoral TP53 expression have shorter survival periods than 
those with low expression. These findings suggest that TP53 mutations 
comprise a crucial factor affecting patient survival. Moreover, as a tumor 
suppressor gene, TP53 is associated with a lower survival rate when it is 
highly expressed, indicating that high expression of this gene could be 
related  to  TP53  mutations.  We  conducted  a  statistical  analysis  of  the 
mutation  sites  in  breast  cancer  and  found  that  patient  samples 
frequently exhibit mutations at three sites, R248W, R175H, and R273H. 
Further,  patients  with  the  TP53R175H  mutation  tend  to  have  shorter 
survival times than those without this mutation. Thus, by concentrating 
on studying hotspot mutations, we can gain a better understanding of 
how mutations affect breast cancer and offer more assistance in patient 
treatment. 

p53,  as  a  transcription  factor,  directly  regulates  the  expression  of 
approximately  500  genes,  some  of  which  are  involved  in  pathways 
including cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, apoptotic cell death, or 
DNA damage repair; that is, they jointly prevent tumor occurrence [26]. 
When mutated, its tumor-suppressive function is eliminated and it ac-
quires a pro-cancer function. This study found that the proliferation rate 
of breast cancer cells was significantly accelerated after normal breast 
epithelial cells and wild-type TP53-expressing breast cancer cells were 
transfected with a TP53R175H-mutant plasmid. Hence, it was concluded 
that the TP53R175H  mutation promotes breast cancer cell proliferation. 
Mutations in most other tumor suppressors result in the production of 
loss-of-function  truncated  or  unstable  proteins.  In  contrast,  TP53 
missense  mutations  result  in  the  production  of  full-length  proteins, 
which often accumulate at high levels in tumor cells [27]. We also found 
that p53 protein expression was higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC 
cells, and we verified, through cytological experiments, that p53 protein 
was only highly expressed in breast cancer cells harboring the mutation. 
Simultaneously, this study retrospectively analyzed the expression of Ki- 
67 in patient samples of TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer and found 
that  compared  to  that  in  the  non-TNBC  group,  Ki-67  expression  was 
significantly increased in the TNBC group. These results indicated that 
TNBC cells proliferate faster than non-TNBC cells. Therefore, based on 
an  analysis  of  the  aforementioned  experimental  results,  it  can  be 
concluded that TP53 mutations lead to an increase in p53 protein levels. 
Moreover, this mutated p53 protein might be associated with the rapid 
proliferation of TNBC cells and poor prognosis. 

MAPK, a signaling molecule, can convert extracellular stimuli into a 
wide range of cellular responses. Studies have shown that p38 MAPK 
controls  the  proliferation,  differentiation,  survival,  and  migration  of 
specific cell types. These processes are activated by environmental and

genotoxic stresses and play key roles in inflammation and tissue balance 
[28,29]. Studies have shown that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is 
highly active in different types of cancer and promotes tumor growth 
[30,31]. The results of this study also show that the p38 MAPK signaling 
pathway  is  highly  active  in  breast  cancer,  especially  when  TP53  is 
mutated, and that the p38 MAPK pathway is more obviously activated 
than those without mutations and promotes the proliferation of breast 
cancer cells. 

Coronins are highly conserved actin-binding proteins that regulate 
various cellular biological processes, such as cell movement and phag-
osome  formation [32,33].  Coronin  1A  is  highly  expressed  in  hemato-
poietic  cells  and  rarely  expressed  in  other  tissues,  regulating 
intracellular  balance,  including  cell  survival  and  apoptosis  [34–37]. 
Recently, the expression of coronin 1A in PC12 cells and the inhibitory 
effect of coronin 1A on the growth of neutrophils have been reported 
[38], thus extending the role of coronin 1A to cells other than hemato-
poietic cells. However, whether coronin 1A plays a regulatory role in 
breast  cancer  requires  further  investigation.  The  results  of  this  study 
showed that the coronin 1A protein is highly expressed in TP53-wild- 
type  breast  cancer  and  normal  breast  epithelial  cells  and  that  its 
expression is inhibited in TP53R175H-mutant breast cancer cells. At the 
same  time,  high  coronin  1A  protein  expression  was  found  to  inhibit 
activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Therefore, by overexpressing the 
coronin  1A  protein,  the  proliferation  of  breast  cancer  cells  can  be 
inhibited, providing a new approach for the treatment of this disease. 

Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are relatively common 
in cancer, and attempts to restore p53 functions in tumors as a thera-
peutic  strategy  began  several  decades  ago.  In  recent  years,  several 
promising  approaches  for  p53-based  therapy  have  emerged,  with 

increasing attention being paid to small molecules that can restore the 
function of mutant p53 proteins and drugs tailored to specific types of 
p53 mutants emerging [39]. Due to its diverse biological activities, tea 
polyphenol has a wide variety of clinical applications, and some studies 
have  shown  that  tea  polyphenol  nanoparticles  have  excellent  thera-
peutic  effects  in  the  treatment  of  hepatitis  [40].  In  addition,  by  sup-
pressing  the  Wnt/β-catenin  pathway,  epigallocatechin  gallate  inhibits 
the proliferation of colorectal cancer stem cells and cause them to un-
dergo  apoptosis  [41].  epigallocatechin  gallate  helps  the  therapy  of 
androgen-dependent  prostate  cancer  by  stimulating  an  elevation  in 
intracellular Ca2 + levels within prostate cancer cells [42]. This study 
further  found  that  catechins  in  tea  polyphenols  can  promote  the 
expression of coronin 1A by binding to the p53 protein, thereby inhib-
iting the proliferation of breast cancer cells. This study thus provides a 
new approach for the treatment of breast cancer.
