Among all types, triple-negative breast cancer is particularly challenging to cure because of its high recurrence rates and invasive and metastatic capacity. Although numerous studies have explored the role of TP53 mutations in cancer, there is a dearth of research regarding the correlation between TP53 mutations and breast cancer cell proliferation. In this study, our aim was to examine the impact of TP53 mutations on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer bioinformatics techniques. To detect cell proliferation, a CCK8 assay was performed, and western blotting was used to identify the expression of p53, p38, and p-p38 proteins. Cellular mRNA sequencing was used to screen target genes of TP53 mutations, and molecular docking was performed to identify the drugs that could hinder the proliferation of breast cancer cells.The results showed that the TP53 mutation rate is higher in patients with triple-negative breast cancer than non-triple-negative breast cancer, and those with TP53 mutations tended to have a poorer prognosis than those without. Patients with R175H site mutations also had shorter survival times than those without. Cytological experiments revealed that the TP53R175H mutation increases the rate of breast cancer cell proliferation. In conjunction with this, CORO1A was found to be a downstream target of TP53 mutations, and it was determined to promote breast cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, CORO1A overexpression resulted in the downregulation of p-p38 levels. Molecular docking studies further revealed that tea polyphenols can inhibit breast cancer proliferation by binding to p53. 1. Introduction cancer. Worldwide, female breast cancer has recently become the most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7 %) . Among them, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype with high invasive and metastatic capacity, frequent recurrence, and a poor prognosis, accounts for 12–18 % of breast cancer cases . At present, breast cancer treatment mainly includes surgical treatment, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy, among others [3–5]. However, for malignant breast cancers, such as triple- negative breast cancer, less than 30 % of patients experienced verified objective responses with precision medication . Therefore, it is crucial to explore new therapeutic strategies for triple-negative breast TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, is mutated in approximately half of all malignant tumors, including breast, colon, lung, and liver cancer, among others . Previous studies have demonstrated that TP53 mutations are involved in the progression of various tumors. For example, in colorectal cancer, the p53-R273H mutation enhances the stemness of colorectal cancer by regulating specific lncRNAs , and the p53- R248Q mutation can upregulate REGγ expression to promote endometrial cancer . In breast cancer, several studies have already demonstrated that TP53 mutations can serve as promising biomarkers [10,11] and therapeutic targets for patients [12,13], particularly those with the triple-negative subtype . However, the exact role of TP53 mutations in breast cancer remains unclear.

Y. Su et al. Recently, polyphenols, the predominant active compounds in tea, have been identified with strong antioxidant and anticancer properties, particularly in patients receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy . Existing studies have shown that they can effectively prevent lung, esophageal, stomach, liver, and prostate cancer [16–20]. However, the potential of tea polyphenols to be used as therapeutic agents for breast cancer and their possible association with TP53 mutations remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the effects of TP53 hotspot mutations on breast cancer cell proliferation. We further screened crucial targets associated with the function of TP53 mutations and investigated how these alterations regulate breast cancer cell proliferation. We also aimed to address the questions of whether tea polyphenols can serve as therapeutic agents and their effect on TP53-mutated breast cancer. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reagents and antibodies Adezmapimod hydrochloride, SB203580 (SB) were purchased from Med Chem Express (HY-10256A, NJ, USA), and tea polyphenols were obtained from Meilunbio (MB5041-1, Dalian, China). The primary antibodies included p53 antibody (AF0879, Affinity Biosciences, US), p38 antibody (BS3566, bioworld, Nanjing, China), p- p38 antibody (BS4635, bioworld, Nanjing, China), CORO1A Antibody (A04245-2, Boster, Wuhan, China), and anti-GAPDH (BM1623, Boster, Wuhan, China). The Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was obtained from Boster Biological Technology (BA1054, Wuhan, China). 2.2. Cell culture ZR-75-1 cells (CL-0247, Pricella, Wuhan, China) were cultured in vitro in RPMI-1640 medium (C11875500BT, Gibco, USA). The medium was supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (BI, USA) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (T1300, Solarbio, Beijing, China). MCF-10A cells (CL-0525; Pricella, Wuhan, China) were cultured in an MCF 10A cell-specific medium (CM-0525, Pricella, Wuhan, China). All cell types were grown at 37 C with 5 % CO2. ◦ 2.3. Expression of Ki-67 protein We reviewed 123 patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the Tangshan Maternal and Child Health Hospital between 2019 and 2020. We also compiled and statistically analyzed Ki-67 protein expression in samples from these patients. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tangshan Maternal and Child Health Hospital (2022-063- 01). 2.4. Western blot assay A polyacrylamide gel was used to separate total proteins, which were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After incubating the membranes in 5 % skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, ◦ they were incubated overnight at 4 C with the primary antibody. After three washes in 1 × TBST (T1082, Solarbio, Beijing, China), membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and then washed again. ECL Plus Hypersensitive Luminescence Solution (AR1197, Boster, Wuhan, China) was used to identify the protein signals. 2.5. Lentivirus transfection To generate p53 wild-type breast cancer cells (ZR-75-1) and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) expressing the p53-R175H mutation, we obtained p53-R175H-mutated lentiviral particles (H17853, pSLenti- EF1-mCherry-P2A-Puro-CMV-TP53(R175H)-3 × FLAG-WPRE) and control lentiviral particles (GL123, pSLenti-EF1-mCherry-P2A-Puro- CMV-MCS-3 × FLAG-WPRE) from OBiO (Shanghai, China), which were transfected into these cells. ZR-75-1 and MCF-10A cells were infected according to the manufacturer’s recommended multiplicity of infection value of 10:1. To overexpress the CORO1A gene, we constructed lentiviral particles (CORO1A, LPP-M0030-Lv105-100), which were from Gene Copoeia (Guangzhou, China), and control lentiviral particles (negative Control, LPP-NEG-Lv105- 050) were simultaneously transfected into the p53-R175H mutant-expressing cells. 2.6. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay CCK8 was used to evaluate cell proliferation. MCF-10A (4,000 cells/ well) and ZR-75-1 (40,000 cells/well) cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. We incubated the cells for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and then, we added 10 μL of CCK8 to each well and incubated the plate for 1 h. Finally, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Additionally, the CCK8 assay can be used to explore the inhibition and survival rates of the drug in cells. The inhibition rate formula was as follows: inhibition rate = [(control wells (cid:0) test wells)]/(control wells (cid:0) blank wells)] × 100. 2.7. mRNA sequencing To extract total RNA from the cells, the cells were first observed under a microscope to confirm their integrity (ruptured cells release RNAase to degrade RNA). The adherent cells were washed twice with pre-chilled 1 × PBS, and the appropriate amount of lysate TRIpure Reagent (332131AX, Aidlab, Beijing, China), and the amount of TRIpure were determined according to the area of the culture plate (1 mL per 10 cm2). The extracted RNA was sent to Personal Bio (Nanjing, China) for mRNA sequencing. 2.8. Bioinformatics analysis After logging into the cBioPortal website (org/), we selected 8905 samples from 22 studies, including adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (MSK, J Pathol. 2015) and breast cancer (HTAN, 2022 and METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat Commun 2016), among others. Finally, we entered “TP53″ to determine the mutation status of TP53 in breast cancer and the survival status of patients. Sample information regarding TP53 mutations in these samples and the mutation counts in triple-negative breast cancer and non-triple-negative breast cancer was downloaded. Using the GEPIA2 (cancer-pku.cn/#index) website, we obtained the overall survival curve for TP53 in breast cancer. For the survival analysis, with respect to mutations in specific locations, we used the LinkedOmic database (The level of p53 protein expression in breast cancer was evaluated using the UALCAN database. First, the UALCAN database website was accessed and CPTAC was clicked to enter a new page. On the new page, the gene name for the desired protein level was inputted in the “Enter gene name(s)” interface. In the “CPTAC dataset” section, “Breast cancer” was selected, and in the “Links for analysis” section, “Total Protein” was chosen. Finally, “Major subclass” was selected to obtain statistical graphs and results. 2.9. Molecular docking First, we prepared the structural files of the proteins and small molecules before docking. The 3D structures of the small molecules were obtained from the PubChem database, and the protein structures were derived from the PDB database. After preparing the protein and small molecule structures, both the ligand and receptor structures were opened in AutoDockTools to generate docking boxes. Finally, “Run AutoDock Vina” was executed to perform molecular docking. By default, 10 docking results were obtained. BiochemicalPharmacology221(2024)1160472 Y. Su et al. 2.10. Statistical analysis Data were expressed as the mean ± SD and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Analyses between two groups were performed based on a two-tailed Student’s t-test. One-way analysis of variance (One Way ANOVA) was used to compare differences in terms of the influence of one independent variable or factor. Two-factor ANOVA was used to analyze cases of two-factor influence. An independent sample t-test was used for both groups. Analysis of the association between two or more sample rates (composition ratio) and two categorical variables was performed using the chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. 3. Results 3.1. TP53 mutations in breast cancer We analyzed the rate of TP53 gene mutations in tumors using the data from cBioPortal database and observed that this varied across multiple cancer types, with the lowest mutation rate in thyroid cancer (2.08 %), the highest mutation rate in ovarian cancer (97.27 %), and a mutation rate of 50.23 % in breast cancer (Fig. 1a). To understand TP53 mutations in different types of breast cancer, we divided the 3489 samples in the cBioPortal database into triple-negative and non-triple- negative (positive for at least one of ER, PR, and Her-2 protein) breast cancer. We found that the mutation rate in non-TNBC was 25.13 %, whereas that in TNBC was 78.45 %. The results also showed that breast cancer cells proliferate more rapidly in patients with TNBC (Fig. 1c). To gain a better understanding of the role of TP53 in breast cancer survival, we compared patients with breast cancer carrying high and low TP53 gene expression using the GEPIA2 website, and patients with higher TP53 expression had poorer survival rates (Fig. 1d). Based on the data from the cBioPortal database, among 4954 patients with breast cancer carrying TP53 mutations had shorter survival times (P < 0.001) on examining the overall survival time (in months) (Fig. 1e). Additionally, we examined the progression-free survival periods (measured in months) of 135 patients with breast cancer and found that those with TP53 mutations had shorter survival times (P < 0.001). 3.2. Analysis of TP53 mutations and expression in breast cancer Using all samples from 22 breast cancer databases compiled on the website cBioPortal, TP53 mutation loci were analyzed. Mutations were found in 3078 samples, including 1785 missense mutations, 977 truncating mutations, 223 splice mutations, 90 in-frame mutations and three SV/fusion mutations. The mutations with the highest frequencies were R248W, R175H, and R273H (Fig. 2a). The survival times of patients with breast cancer carrying these three common mutations (R248W, R175H, and R273H) and patients with breast cancer but without mutations were analyzed using the LinkedOmics database. The results revealed that patients with breast cancer with the R175H mutation locus had shorter survival times than those without (Fig. 2b, c, and d). TP53 functions are primarily mediated by the p53 protein; therefore, we investigated expression of the p53 protein in cases of TP53 Fig. 1. Mutations of TP53 in breast cancer.

First, the UALCAN database was used to evaluate expression levels of the p53 protein in breast cancer using a clinical proteomics tumor analysis dataset. The expression levels of p53 were higher in samples from patients with TNBC than in samples from patients without TNBC (P < 0.05; Fig. 2e). We also used TP53-mutant cells (MDA-MB- 231, SK-BR-3), TP53-nonsense-mutant cells (HCC1937 cells), and cells without such mutations (MCF-10A, ZR-75-1, MCF-7) for western blot assays and found that the expression of p53 varied among these cells (Fig. 2f). Specifically, p53 was substantially expressed only in breast cancer cells with mutations. Breast cancer cells with wild-type TP53 (ZR- 75-1) and normal breast cancer epithelial cells (MCF-10A) were then transfected with the TP53R175H-mutant plasmid. The lentiviral particles used for transfection contained the puromycin resistance gene, and the successful cells were selected by puromycin deletion. In order to visually assess the transfection efficiency, we employed mCherry fluorescent labelling (Fig. 2g-j), and the expression of p53 was determined through western blot assays (Fig. 2k, l). Here, p53 was highly expressed in both breast cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 and normal breast cancer epithelial cells when they were transfected with the gene variant. 3.3. TP53R175H regulates cell proliferation through the P38 mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway The proliferation of MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells following transfection with the TP53R175H variant was evaluated using CCK8 tests to determine the corresponding effect on breast cancer cells. In this study, cells were separated into three groups, including the control (untransfected cells), p53-R175H (cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant), and NC (cells transfected with an empty lentiviral vector). The results revealed that the proliferation rate of cells in the p53-R175H group was significantly higher than that in the control and NC groups (Fig. 3a–d, P < 0.01). Given that abnormalities in the inflammatory pathway can promote tumor development, we determined whether the TP53R175H mutation would affect the P38 MAPK inflammatory pathway. The expression of p38 and phosphorylated p38 proteins in MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant was detected by western blotting, and the cells were divided into control, p53-R175H, and NC groups. The results showed that the expression levels of p38 and phosphorylated p38 proteins were increased with TP53R175H transfection (Fig. 3e–h). To further investigate the effect of P38 MAPK pathway activation on the proliferation of breast cancer cells, we utilized a P38 inhibitor SB203580 based on different concentrations (100 nM, 1 μM, and 10 μM) to inhibit expression of the p-p38 protein, with western blotting experiments conducted to detect this (Fig. 3i–l). The control group comprised MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant, whereas the experimental group included cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant incubated with P38 inhibitor SB203580 at different concentrations (100 nM, 1 μM, and 10 μM) for 24 h. After detecting the expression of p38 and p-p38 proteins through western blot experiments and confirming that the P38 inhibitor, at these concentrations, could effectively reduce p-p38 protein levels, we performed CCK8 experiments to determine its inhibitory effect on MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant. The data revealed that the rate of cell inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of the selective P38 pathway inhibitor (Fig. 3m, n). 3.4.

Su et al. proliferation, we transfected ZR-75-1 cells with this variant. The cells were divided into three groups, the control (untransfected cells), p53- R175H (cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant), and NC (cells transfected with an empty lentiviral vector). Each group underwent three rounds of repeated transfections, and mRNA sequencing was performed on all three cell groups. An analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the sequencing results revealed that in the p53- R175H group, the nucleotide at position chr17:7675088 (GRCh38. p14) was changed from C to T. To visually confirm the success of ZR-75- 1 cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant, we performed IGV visualization analysis (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, cluster analysis of the three cell groups illustrated that the p53-R175H group displayed significant changes in mRNA expression relative to those in the control and NC groups (Fig. 4b). Using GO enrichment analysis, we discovered that the GO term “cell population proliferation” was significantly enriched (P = 0.000296) through a comparison of the p53-R175H group and control (Fig. 4c) groups. Similarly, a comparison between the p53-R175H and NC groups also showed the significant enrichment of “cell population proliferation” (P = 0.046504; Fig. 4d). However, there was no significant enrichment of this term (P = 0.386039823332065) when comparing the control and NC (Fig. 4e) groups. GO enrichment analysis revealed a decrease in COR1A expression in the cell population proliferation pathway in the p53-R175H group relative to that in the control and NC groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 4f). To further verify that TP53 affects CORO1A protein expressed, via modulation of the CORO1A gene, when the R175H mutation is present, we divided MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells into control (untransfected cells), p53-R175H (cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant), and NC (cells transfected with empty lentiviral vector) groups after transfection and examined the expression of the coronin 1A protein Fig. 4.

Su et al. by performing western blotting. The results revealed that coronin 1A protein expression was decreased in the p53-R175H group (Fig. 4g–j; P < 0.01). 3.5. Coronin 1A protein promotes cell proliferation by regulating the P38 MAPK pathway To explore the effect of coronin 1A protein on breast cancer cell proliferation, we transfected CORO1A-overexpressing lentiviral particles into MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells and divided the cells into p53- R175H (blank group: cells transfected with only the TP53R175H variant), p53-R175H-CORO1A (cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant and overexpressing the CORO1A gene), and p53-R175H-NC (empty lentivirus-expressing cells transfected with the TP53R175H variant) groups. The expression of coronin 1A protein in the three groups of cells after transfection was examined by performing western blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 5e and g. Transfection was successful in obtaining TP53R175H variant-expressing cells overexpressing CORO1A. After obtaining TP53R175H-expressing cells with CORO1A overexpression, we explored their proliferation using CCK8 assays. We found that with coronin 1A protein overexpression (p53-R175H-CORO1A group), the TP53R175H-expressing cells proliferated more slowly than those without overexpression (Fig. 5a–d). This indicated that high coronin 1A protein expression inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. To explore whether coronin 1A regulates the P38 MAPK pathway, we used western blotting to detect the expression of P38 MAPK pathway proteins in cells from the p53-R175H, p53-R175H-CORO1A, and p53- R175H-NC groups. The results showed that the expression of p38 and p-p38 proteins was lower in the p53-R175H-CORO1A group than in the p53-R175H and p53-R175H-NC groups, and these differences were statistically significant (Fig. 5e–h, P < 0.05). Therefore, we concluded that the TP53R175H mutation promotes activation of the P38 MAPK pathway by suppressing coronin 1A protein expression. 3.6. Tea polyphenols inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by promoting coronin 1A protein expression To demonstrate that TP53R175H inhibition could suppress the effects on coronin 1A expression, molecular docking was performed, exploring whether tea polyphenols could block the inhibition of coronin 1A by binding to the mutant protein encoded by TP53R175H. Results of the prediction revealed that catechins, the major components of tea polyphenols, can bind to p53. The main catechins included epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate, with maximum binding energies for docking of 7, 7, 6.7, and 7.7 kcal/mol respectively (Fig. 6a–d). We then verified the predicted molecular docking results. First, we used different concentrations of tea polyphenols (50, 100, and 200 μg/ mL) to treat MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells of the p53-R175H group and performed western blot assays to simultaneously examine protein levels in the control (untransfected cells), p53-R175H (cells with the TP53R175H variant without tea polyphenol intervention), and NC (cells transfected with the empty lentiviral vector) groups, as well as in cells expressing p53-R175H treated with different concentrations of tea polyphenols. Expression of the coronin 1A protein was found to increase with increasing concentrations of tea polyphenols, and these differences were statistically significant (Fig. 6e–h, P ≤ 0.05). To explore the inhibitory effect of tea polyphenols on TP53R175H- mutant breast cancer cell proliferation, we further performed CCK8 assays using MCF-10A and ZR-75-1 cells expressing p53-R175H. These cells were treated with different concentrations of tea polyphenols (50, 100, and 200 μg/mL). The rate of TP53R175H-mutant breast cancer cell proliferation suppression increased with higher concentrations and longer durations of tea polyphenol treatment, especially at 100 μg/mL, which resulted in the highest inhibition rate (Fig. 6i, j). 4. Discussion TP53 mutations are commonly observed in tumors, and the findings of this study corroborate that their frequency varies across different tumor types. The lowest mutation rate was found in thyroid cancer (2.08 %), the highest mutation rate was in ovarian cancer (97.27 %), and the TP53 mutation rate in breast cancer was 50.23 %. Moreover, TP53 mutations are correlated with tumor malignancy; for example, small cell lung cancer [21,22], high-grade serous ovarian cancer , and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma can exhibit TP53 mutation rates greater than 80 %. This study also showed that TP53 mutation rate in TNBC was 78.45 %, which was significantly higher than that in non- TNBC. Based on the results of this study, there could be a relationship between TP53 mutations and TNBC. Mutations in TP53 not only impair the anti-tumor activity of the encoded protein, but also cause the mutated p53 protein to develop new oncogenic characteristics. Such mutations promote the survival of cancer cells and are linked to an ineffective treatment response and unfavorable prognosis . The experimental results also indicated that patients with TP53 mutations have shorter overall and progression-free survival times than those without these mutations. In addition, patients with high tumoral TP53 expression have shorter survival periods than those with low expression. These findings suggest that TP53 mutations comprise a crucial factor affecting patient survival. Moreover, as a tumor suppressor gene, TP53 is associated with a lower survival rate when it is highly expressed, indicating that high expression of this gene could be related to TP53 mutations. We conducted a statistical analysis of the mutation sites in breast cancer and found that patient samples frequently exhibit mutations at three sites, R248W, R175H, and R273H. Further, patients with the TP53R175H mutation tend to have shorter survival times than those without this mutation. Thus, by concentrating on studying hotspot mutations, we can gain a better understanding of how mutations affect breast cancer and offer more assistance in patient treatment. p53, as a transcription factor, directly regulates the expression of approximately 500 genes, some of which are involved in pathways including cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, apoptotic cell death, or DNA damage repair; that is, they jointly prevent tumor occurrence . When mutated, its tumor-suppressive function is eliminated and it acquires a pro-cancer function. This study found that the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells was significantly accelerated after normal breast epithelial cells and wild-type TP53-expressing breast cancer cells were transfected with a TP53R175H-mutant plasmid. Hence, it was concluded that the TP53R175H mutation promotes breast cancer cell proliferation. Mutations in most other tumor suppressors result in the production of loss-of-function truncated or unstable proteins. In contrast, TP53 missense mutations result in the production of full-length proteins, which often accumulate at high levels in tumor cells . We also found that p53 protein expression was higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC cells, and we verified, through cytological experiments, that p53 protein was only highly expressed in breast cancer cells harboring the mutation. Simultaneously, this study retrospectively analyzed the expression of Ki- 67 in patient samples of TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer and found that compared to that in the non-TNBC group, Ki-67 expression was significantly increased in the TNBC group. These results indicated that TNBC cells proliferate faster than non-TNBC cells. Therefore, based on an analysis of the aforementioned experimental results, it can be concluded that TP53 mutations lead to an increase in p53 protein levels. Moreover, this mutated p53 protein might be associated with the rapid proliferation of TNBC cells and poor prognosis. MAPK, a signaling molecule, can convert extracellular stimuli into a wide range of cellular responses. Studies have shown that p38 MAPK controls the proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration of specific cell types. These processes are activated by environmental and BiochemicalPharmacology221(2024)1160477 Y. Su et al. Fig. 5. Coronin 1A protein promotes cell proliferation by regulating the P38 MAPK pathway.

Studies have shown that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is highly active in different types of cancer and promotes tumor growth [30,31]. The results of this study also show that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is highly active in breast cancer, especially when TP53 is mutated, and that the p38 MAPK pathway is more obviously activated than those without mutations and promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Coronins are highly conserved actin-binding proteins that regulate various cellular biological processes, such as cell movement and phagosome formation [32,33]. Coronin 1A is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and rarely expressed in other tissues, regulating intracellular balance, including cell survival and apoptosis [34–37]. Recently, the expression of coronin 1A in PC12 cells and the inhibitory effect of coronin 1A on the growth of neutrophils have been reported , thus extending the role of coronin 1A to cells other than hematopoietic cells. However, whether coronin 1A plays a regulatory role in breast cancer requires further investigation. The results of this study showed that the coronin 1A protein is highly expressed in TP53-wild- type breast cancer and normal breast epithelial cells and that its expression is inhibited in TP53R175H-mutant breast cancer cells. At the same time, high coronin 1A protein expression was found to inhibit activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Therefore, by overexpressing the coronin 1A protein, the proliferation of breast cancer cells can be inhibited, providing a new approach for the treatment of this disease. Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are relatively common in cancer, and attempts to restore p53 functions in tumors as a therapeutic strategy began several decades ago. In recent years, several promising approaches for p53-based therapy have emerged, with increasing attention being paid to small molecules that can restore the function of mutant p53 proteins and drugs tailored to specific types of p53 mutants emerging . Due to its diverse biological activities, tea polyphenol has a wide variety of clinical applications, and some studies have shown that tea polyphenol nanoparticles have excellent therapeutic effects in the treatment of hepatitis . In addition, by suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, epigallocatechin gallate inhibits the proliferation of colorectal cancer stem cells and cause them to undergo apoptosis . epigallocatechin gallate helps the therapy of androgen-dependent prostate cancer by stimulating an elevation in intracellular Ca2 + levels within prostate cancer cells . This study further found that catechins in tea polyphenols can promote the expression of coronin 1A by binding to the p53 protein, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells. This study thus provides a new approach for the treatment of breast cancer. 5.
