SUMMARY

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a heterogeneous predisposition to an individually variable spectrum of cancers
caused by pathogenic TP53 germline variants. We used a clustering method to assign TP53 missense variants
to classes based on their functional activities in experimental assays assessing biological p53 functions. Cor-
relations with LFS phenotypes were analyzed using the public germline TP53 mutation database and validated
in three LFS clinical cohorts. Class A carriers recapitulated all phenotypic traits of fully penetrant LFS, whereas
class B carriers showed a slightly less penetrant form dominated by speciﬁc cancers, consistent with the
notion that these classes identify variants with distinct functional properties. Class C displayed a lower lifetime
cancer risk associated with attenuated LFS features, consistent with the notion that these variants have hypo-
morphic features. Class D carriers showed low lifetime cancer risks inconsistent with LFS deﬁnitions. This clas-
siﬁcation of TP53 variants provides insights into structural/functional features causing pathogenicity.

INTRODUCTION

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS; Mendelian Inheritance in Man
#151623) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syn-
drome associated with a high lifetime risk of a broad spectrum
of cancers caused by pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP)
TP53 germline (or mosaic) variants, 80% of which are missense.1
Typically, LFS occurs in three phases, (1) a childhood phase (0–17
years), characterized by a quartet of early life cancers (adrenocor-
tical carcinoma [ACC], choroid plexus tumor [CPT], medulloblas-
toma [MB], and rhabdomyosarcoma [RMS], all of which occur
almost exclusively before the age of ten years), and a high risk
of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), osteosarcoma (OS), and central ner-
vous system tumors (CNS) in adolescence; (2) an early adult
phase (18–45 years), characterized by premenopausal breast
cancer, multiple STS, and CNS; and (3) a late adult phase (over
45 years), characterized by lung adenocarcinoma, STS, colorectal

cancer, and prostate cancer.2 Clinical deﬁnitions are traditionally
based on so-called ‘‘classic’’ LFS criteria,3 whereas revised
Chompret criteria4 capture the broad spectrum of LFS-related
cancers and are aimed at identifying patients for TP53 mutation
testing. Based on clinical phenotypes, two forms of LFS have
been identiﬁed, with (1) LFS, deﬁned by the presence of a P/LP
TP53 variant in persons/families meeting LFS testing criteria or
with cancer <18 years; and (2) attenuated LFS (aLFS), deﬁned
by the presence of a P/LP TP53 variant in a person/family who
does not meet LFS testing criteria.5 This phenotypic distinction
provides a framework for further investigating subtle differences
in genotype-phenotype correlations by classifying TP53 variants
according to their pathogenicity.

The p53 protein is a multi-functional transcription factor regu-
lating a complex network of cellular and systemic anti-prolifera-
tive responses.6–8 Loss of these functions, often caused by inac-
tivating missense mutations in the TP53 gene, impairs several

coordinated mechanisms of growth suppression that normally
operate to counteract carcinogenesis.9 The main functional
feature of tumor-associated somatic mutations is the loss of
DNA binding and transactivation capacity of the p53 tumor sup-
pressor protein (loss of function [LOF]), either by altering the
structure of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or by destabilizing
p53 oligomerization, which is required for high-afﬁnity DNA bind-
ing. Many missense variants cause stable protein expression,
which, in addition to LOF, may exert dominant-negative effects
(DNEs) over wild-type allele products and have also been pro-
posed to exert a number of pro-oncogenic gain-of-function
(GOF) effects documented in experimental cell and animal
models,10 the phenotypic consequences of which remain un-
clear in the context of LFS.

Large-scale systematic studies have assessed the impact of
thousands of missense variants on biochemical and biological
p53 protein functions in yeast or cell-based experimental
assays.11–13 This wealth of information, together with carriers’
phenotypic traits, is used by the ClinGen TP53 expert panel to
inform variant
interpretation for clinical purposes (https://
clinicalgenome.org/afﬁliation/50013/).14 However, the precise
correlations between the functional features of TP53 variants
and clinical LFS phenotypes have not been systematically ad-
dressed. In the present study, we develop a classiﬁcation of
TP53 missense variants into 4 functional classes that corre-
spond to distinct cancer phenotypes, using as primary criteria
the high-resolution clustering of the functional dataset devel-
oped by C. Ishioka and collaborators in a yeast-based transac-
tivation assay (YTA).12 This dataset has systematically measured
the transactivation capacity of a total of 2,314 missense variants
toward synthetic reporters controlled by eight different p53 DNA
response elements, thus providing eight different ‘‘mugshots’’
for each variant that score quantitative differences in their trans-
activation capacity but also highlight qualitative features in their
capacity to distinguish among promoters that have not been sys-
tematically exploited for variant classiﬁcation so far. Next, we
have challenged the robustness of the classes based on YTA
clusters in predicting LFS phenotypes by interpolating them
with clusters based on saturation mutagenesis screens (SMSs)
of p53 suppressor activity in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type
and null cell lines11 (Figure 1). Overall, this two-step approach
supports the deﬁnition of four functional classes of missense
TP53 variants (A, B, C, and D). To precisely assess their associ-
ations with LFS phenotypes, we have compared these classes
with nonsense/frameshift variants (class 0) predicted as
completely inactivating the p53 protein. Mapping these classes
on phenotypic LFS data from the public repository of germline
TP53 variants curated at NCI (https://tp53.cancer.gov/) revealed
that each class is associated with speciﬁc phenotypic traits
within the LFS spectrum. Our results provide a reﬁned resolution
of genotype-phenotype correlations in LFS as well as insights on
structural/functional features that specify variant pathogenicity.

phenotypes in TP53 mutation carriers. The list of TP53 missense
variants and corresponding classes and clusters is presented in
Table S1. Iterative clustering of the YTA dataset identiﬁed a total
of 16 clusters of various sizes based on variant similarities in their
capacity to bind and activate each of the eight promoters con-
taining different versions of p53 DNA consensus elements
(from 613 variants in cluster 2_2_1 to 5 variants in cluster 3)
(Figures S1 and S2A). The ﬁrst layer of clustering broadly sepa-
rated variants with signiﬁcant loss of activity (cluster 1) from
‘‘supertrans’’ variants (cluster 3) and variants retaining levels of
activities similar to those of wild-type p53 (cluster 2). Further
layers of clustering separated, distinct variant subgroups among
clusters 1 and 2. Speciﬁcally, cluster 1 was resolved into 6 clus-
ters, including variants ranging from quasi-complete loss of
transcriptional activity toward all promoters (cluster 1_1_1,
‘‘triple_1’’) to variable levels or activity toward some, but not
all, promoter sequences (among which the largest clusters
were 1_1_3 and 1_3_1 and 1_3_2). Thus this clustering approach
could resolve variants into a diversity of structure-function-muta-
tion subgroups based on their qualitative and quantitative tran-
scriptional similarities.

To map these clusters onto the distribution of germline TP53
mutations, we grouped them into four classes (A to D), broadly
reﬂecting a gradient of activity with A having the lowest overall
transcriptional activity and D the highest, and B and C displaying
intermediate and heterogeneous activities toward different re-
porters (Figure S2). These four YTA classes differed in variant
distribution within the p53 protein structure (Figures 2A and S3)
and in their predicted structural/functional effects (Figure S4).
When compared with biophysical prediction scores (Sorting
Intolerant From Tolerant, Align Grantham Variation and Gran-
tham Deviation)16,17 and integrative structural and functional
scores,18 classes highlighted a gradient from A to D, with A
and B being enriched in deleterious and non-functional features
while C and D were enriched in non-deleterious and functional
features. Class A included all common TP53 cancer mutation
hotspots and was enriched in variants at residues located within
the surface of the p53 protein in direct contact with DNA, in
structural elements supporting the DNA-binding surface, or in
structural motifs required for the cohesion of the p53 tetrameri-
zation domain. Class B included variants mapping to the DBD
of p53, albeit at different residues than class A, mostly located
within deﬁned sections of the beta-sheets that constitute the
scaffold of the DBD as well as in loops exposed at the surface
of the protein but not within its DNA-binding surface. Class C
and D were enriched in variants that mapped to the N terminus
or to the extreme C terminus of p53. These sites were poorly rep-
resented in other classes.

Figure 2B shows the distribution of classes A–D in three TP53
variant datasets: cancer-related germline variants (NCI; https://
tp53.cancer.gov/), cancer-related somatic variants (COSMIC;
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), and non-cancer-related
germline variants (gnomAD; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.
org/). Class A variants were enriched by factors of 4.5- and
3.3-fold in the COSMIC and NCI datasets, respectively, but
were counter-selected (0.2-fold) in the gnomAD dataset. Like-
wise, albeit to a lesser extent, class B variants showed positive
selection in COSMIC (1.1) and NCI (1.3) datasets, but not in

Figure 1. Strategy for classifying TP53 vari-
ants into functional classes and evaluating
their correlations with cancer phenotypes
in TP53 mutation carriers
First, we used hierarchical Ward’s clustering to
interrogate the yeast-based transcriptional activity
(2,314 variants, YTA dataset).12 This
dataset
approach identiﬁed four YTA classes (A to D)
consistent with predictors of deleteriousness and
reﬂecting a gradient of transcriptional activity from A
(lowest activity) to D (quasi-identical to wild-type).
We also created class 0, including nonsense and
frameshift variants (p53 null genotype). Next, we
analyzed lifetime cancer accrual and tumor patterns
associated with each class using familial and indi-
vidual data from the NCI germline TP53 mutation
database (https://tp53.cancer.gov/).15 Third, we
interpolated each class with clusters of functional
scores from the human cell suppression saturation
mutagenesis screens dataset (8,252 variants, SMS
dataset) developed by Hahn and collaborators.11
Fourth, we assessed the signiﬁcance and limitations
of YTA classes by examining their concordance
with ClinVar expert panel annotations (https://
clinicalgenome.org/afﬁliation/50013/). Finally, we
validated the proposed variant classiﬁcation in three
cohorts of carriers recruited in high-risk cancer
predisposition clinics in Germany, France, and
Canada (n = 821). See also Figures S1 and S2, and
Table S1.

gnomAD (0.2). In contrast, class D variants were enriched in gno-
mAD (1.8) and counter-selected in COSMIC (0.1) and NCI (0.2),
whereas class C was not enriched in any of the datasets. These
results are compatible with the notion that classes A to D corre-
spond to a gradient of cancer-related p53 dysfunction.

YTA classes are associated with distinct phenotypic
patterns within the LF spectrum
To explore the correlations between YTA classes and tumor phe-
notypes within the broad Li-Fraumeni
(LF) spectrum, we
analyzed lifetime cancer accrual and tumor patterns using data
compiled in the NCI germline TP53 mutation database (https://
tp53.cancer.gov/),15 a repository of germline variants detected

in subjects (n = 3,446) from 1,522 families.
For comparing the missense variants with
strict LOF variants, we constructed a class
‘‘zero’’ (0) that included variants consid-
ered as ‘‘null’’ for p53, i.e., nonsense and
frameshift variants that preclude the syn-
thesis of a functional p53 protein (Fig-
ure S5). Class 0 includes variants consid-
ered to have exclusively LOF effects and
thus provides a reference to evaluate
possible DNEs and GOF effects carried
by missense variants in classes A to D.
Figure 3A shows that class A variants
were found in 1,426 (53%) patients, fol-
lowed by class 0 (552, 21%), B (290,
11%), C (242, 9%), and D (171, 6%).
Gender distribution differed among classes, with a lower propor-
tion of males in classes B, C, and D (31.4%, 26.7%, and 32%,
respectively) than in classes 0 and A (40.9% and 40.6%, respec-
tively) (Figure 3B). With respect to lifetime cancer accrual, clas-
ses 0 and A were associated with the most severe proﬁles (me-
dian age at ﬁrst diagnosis = 28 years) (Figures 3C–3E). Classes C
and D were associated with attenuated accrual proﬁles (median
age = 41 years), whereas class B showed an intermediate and
distinct proﬁle (median age = 33 years), characterized by rapid
accrual during childhood (similar to classes A and 0) and slower
accrual during adolescence and adulthood. This gradient of
pathogenicity was reﬂected in the proportion of carriers with
multiple cancers as well as cancer free (Figures 3F and 3G)

types (Figures 3I and 3J). Of note, variants in established cancer
predisposition genes other than TP53 were more frequently
found in carriers of class D variants than in carriers of any other
variant class (Figure 3H).

Comparison across classes revealed statistically signiﬁcant
differences in tumor patterns (Figures 4, S6, and S7; Table S2).
Classes 0 and A shared topological and morphological tumor
patterns that recapitulated the broad phenotype of the LF spec-
trum. This included LFS signature cancers such as childhood
ACC, CPT, RMS, and MB, teenage OS, and early breast phyl-
lodes cancers. There were, however, small but statistically sig-
niﬁcant differences between 0 and A, the latter presenting with
a higher proportion of brain cancers (risk ratio [RR] = 1.53,
95% conﬁdence interval [CI] [1.16–2.05]), including in particular
CPT (Figures 4B, 4C, and S6; Table S2) compared to class 0.
Compared to 0 and A, class B showed a slightly delayed median
age of tumor onset as compared to classes 0 and A as well as a
smaller proportion of most cancers that deﬁne the LF spectrum

(Figures 4B, 4C, and S6), except ACC (RR B vs. A = 2.74 (95% CI
[1.78; 4.14]); RR B vs. 0 = 3.12 (95% CI [1.84–5.34]) (Table S2).
Indeed, in class B, ACC was the most common cancer form
before the age of 10 and was responsible for the rapid cancer
accrual in early life (Figure 3C) despite the rarity of other child-
hood signature cancers (i.e., RMS and MB)
(Figure S6).
Compared to A, class B also showed a higher proportion of can-
cer-free carriers (Figure 3G) and differences in the predominant
forms of CNS cancers (mostly glioblastomas) (Figures 4B and
S6). Compared to 0, A, and B, class C presented with an atten-
uated risk of all cancers of the LF spectrum, except ACC (RR C
vs. A = 2.05 (95% CI [1.20–3.34]) and breast cancers (BCs) (RR C
vs. A = 1.75 (95% CI [1.32–2.31]) (Figures 4B, 4C, and S6,
Table S2). In contrast, class C carriers rarely presented with
OS, CPT, RMS, or MB compared to class 0 and A (Figure S6).
Class C also presented with a higher proportion of cancer-free
carriers than any other class (Figure 3G). Finally, class D included
low penetrance variants, with signature LF cancers such as early
ACC, CPT, MB, OS, and phyllodes tumors of the breast being, if

not absent, signiﬁcantly less represented than in A, B, or C
(Figures 4B, 4C, and S6). The most frequent early cancers in D
were hematopoietic malignancies, which are common sporadic
neoplasia in children, independently of germline TP53 status.
Class D variants retained quasi-wild-type p53 transcriptional
properties for at least half of the YTA promoters tested, consis-
tent with enrichment in variants annotated as benign or likely
benign (B/LB) by ClinVar. Overall, classes 0 and A were associ-
ated with the most severe forms of LFS, class B showed a slightly
less penetrant form with ACC as the most frequent early life
cancer, class C corresponded to an attenuated form predispos-
ing to at least some cancers of the LF spectrum (ACC and BC),

whereas class D did not appear to carry a signiﬁcant risk for
typical LF cancers (Figure 4C).

Dissecting YTA variant classes with functional scores
from human cell-based assays
Despite their sensitivity for capturing subtle structural differ-
ences in DNA interactions caused by mutations, YTA screens
may lack the physiological relevance of human cell-based as-
says aimed at directly evaluating the capacity of p53 variants
to suppress cell growth. To challenge the robustness of YTA
classes in the light of human cell-based functional data, we
have interpolated them with a functional score developed in

Giacomelli et al11 (phenotypic selection model; SMS dataset).
Figure 5A shows that this score was broadly consistent with
YTA classes, with A having the highest and D the lowest median
score. However, individual variant scores were widely distrib-
uted within each class. To further assess this heterogeneity,
we applied Ward clustering using the three phenotypic enrich-
ment scores in the SMS dataset. These scores evaluate the ca-
pacity of TP53 variants to either suppress cell growth or maintain
cell viability either in the presence or absence of wild-type TP53,
thus providing metrics to assess LOF and DNE. This analysis

identiﬁed 3 clusters (G1 to G3), with G1
containing variants with both LOF and
DNE, G2 consisting of variants that had
exclusively LOF effects, and G3 including
variants with enrichment scores similar to
wild-type TP53 (neither LOF nor DNE)
(Figures 5B and 5D). Interpolating G clus-
ters with YTA classes showed that both
class A and B included predominantly G1
and G2 variants, albeit in different propor-
tions, whereas class C and D contained
predominantly of G2 and G3 variants (Fig-
ure 5C). When applied to lifetime cancer
accrual in germline TP53 carriers, the 3 G
clusters enable separating two phenotypic
groups, corresponding to more (G1) or
less severe (G2 and G3) cancer predispo-
sition traits, however without clearly sepa-
rating distinct LF phenotypes (Figure 5E).
We next evaluated the phenotypic hetero-
geneity of each YTA class (A–D) by sepa-
rating them according to SMS clusters
(G1–G3) (Figure 5E). This analysis revealed
that YTA classes were remarkably robust,
showing quasi-identical cancer accrual either for G1 and G2 var-
iants in the A class or G2 and G3 variants in the D class. The only
exception was a G3 variant in the A class, p.K305M, identiﬁed so
far in only 1 family (3 adult patients) that did not match any LFS

of G clusters, supports that the YTA classes captured a degree of
phenotypic severity, which is not represented in the G clustering
(SMS scores in human cells). As supplementary data, we present
additional analyses using another systematic human cell-based
functional score developed by Kotler et al.13 (relative ﬁtness
score; Figure S8) as well as a comparison between YTA classes
and TP53_PROF, a machine learning model that integrates
yeast, cell-based, and computational metrics developed by
Ben-Cohen et al18 (Figure S9). Overall, these analyses further
underlined the remarkable consistency between YTA classes
and other metrics aimed at predicting the impact of missense
mutations in p53.

Clinical signiﬁcance of YTA classes
ClinVar expert panel annotations (https://clinicalgenome.org/
afﬁliation/50013/) are based on expert consensus review of ge-
notype/phenotype correlations and are the current standard for
interpreting TP53 germline variants for clinical purposes.14 How-
ever, these annotations cover only a proportion of all missense
variants in the NCI germline dataset. We thus assessed the
concordance between YTA classes and ClinVar expert panel
as a ﬁrst step to determine whether YTA classes could assist
in the clinical evaluation of variants that have not yet been anno-
tated to date. Figure 6A shows that YTA classes were concor-
dant with expert panel annotations, with A and B classes mostly
represented among P/PL variants and C and D classes mostly
represented among B/LB variants. The only exception was
D49H, a YTA class A – SMS G2 (LOF) variant annotated as LB
by ClinVar. This variant is documented in only one family (2 pa-
tients) that matched the LFS Chompret’s criteria (embryonal
RMS of the cervix at 2 years and Hodgkin’s lymphoma at 15
years).19 Variants annotated as ‘‘Uncertain Signiﬁcance’’ were
predominant in class C variants, followed by class B and D var-
iants, suggesting that YTA classes may help in resolving ambigu-
ities in variant annotations. Overall, YTA classes were remark-
ably consistent with expert panel annotations (p < 0.0001)
(Figures 6B and 3C). Moreover, within classes A, B, and C, can-
cer accrual in carriers of non-expert panel variants was almost
perfectly aligned with that of expert panel-curated variants (Fig-
ure 6C). Thus, YTA classes could adequately predict cancer
accrual and phenotypes in subjects carrying variants not anno-
tated by the expert panel.

To further assess the robustness of YTA classes in a clinical
context, we examined cancer accrual and tumor patterns in
three independent cohorts of carriers recruited in different
high-risk cancer predisposition clinics in Germany (n = 146,
LFS Registry in Hannover), France (n = 578, French LFS cohort),
and Canada (n = 97, Toronto LFS cohort). These cohorts are
maintained and annotated mainly independently of the NCI
germline dataset. Figure 7 shows that, in each cohort, YTA clas-
ses correctly predicted cancer accrual and distinguished among
carriers with quantitative and qualitative differences in the LF

spectrum. In all cohorts, class A carriers presented the most se-
vere phenotype (similar to class 0 in the German and Canadian
cohort). Compared to A, class B carriers had a distinct and
less penetrant phenotype, characterized by high risk of early-
life ACC and slightly delayed overall cancer accrual. Class C car-
riers often had attenuated phenotypes, nevertheless including
cancers typical of the LF spectrum (i.e., ACC and BC) but
excluding most other signature LF childhood cancers, whereas
in class D, tumor patterns tended to be more heterogeneous,
with most of carriers not matching LF spectrum deﬁnitions (Fig-
ure S10). Overall, these observations support that YTA classes
can help to predict speciﬁc patterns of risk in germline carriers
and could be particularly helpful for assessing the risk of novel
variants as well as variants not yet annotated by expert panels
or ClinVar.

DISCUSSION

This classiﬁcation of TP53 missense variants into 4 functional
classes (A–D) supports a robust interpolation between geno-
types (variant characteristics) and phenotypes (cancer risk and
spectrum). The classiﬁcation correctly separated severe from
mild or benign variants in all structural domains of the p53 pro-
tein, including transactivation domain, DBD, and tetramerization
domain. The classiﬁcation is based on quantitative and qualita-
tive similarities between variants in YTA and is remarkably
consistent with human cell-based functional metrics from
SMSs of TP53 variants. However, interpolating YTA classes
with clustered SMS scores showed that YTA classes afforded
superior precision in distinguishing variant carriers with distinct
phenotypic features of LFS.

Class A identiﬁed a group of severe variants that mostly fell
within major structural motifs of the DBD of the p53 protein. Car-
riers of these variants recapitulated all phenotypic traits of severe
LFS. Interestingly, tumor phenotypes in class A carriers were
only marginally distinct from those or carriers of null/frameshift
TP53 variants (class 0), the only difference being a higher propor-
tion of CNS cancers in class A than in class 0 (RR = 1.53, 95% CI
[1.16–2.05]). Likewise, separating class A variants into variants
with DNEs (SMS cluster G1) or simply LOF (SMS cluster G2)
did not reveal signiﬁcant differences in cancer accrual or pheno-
typic spectrum. These observations suggest that, in the context
of LFS, LOF is the main, if not the only functional property of
TP53 variants that causes disease severity and that mutant-spe-
ciﬁc effects such as DNEs or GOF effects play only minor, tissue-
speciﬁc roles.

Most class B variants were distributed within structural mo-
tifs of the DBD that are not in direct contact with DNA. These
variants showed less severe structural and functional features
than class A as well as a greater heterogeneity in their transcrip-
tional activities, suggesting that they may partially retain wild-
type activity toward a subset of promoters. Phenotypes in B

carriers were slightly and selectively attenuated as compared
to A carriers, in particular during childhood and adolescence.
Whereas early signature cancers such as RMS, CPT, MB, or
OS were infrequent in class B carriers, the proportion of ACC
was higher than in classes 0 and A. As a result, class B carriers

show a distinct proﬁle of cancer accrual in early life, with high
risk caused by ACC until age 9, followed by a period of relatively
low risk between ages 10 and 20. The selectivity of class B var-
iants for ACC suggests that perinatal adrenal cortical cells are
exquisitely sensitive to wild-type p53 dosage and that variants

mediating partial loss of wild-type p53 activity may sufﬁce to
enhance the risk of early ACC.

Class C included lower penetrance variants that nevertheless
predisposed to cancers typical of the LF spectrum. This class
was the most heterogeneous when interpolated with SMS
clusters. Interestingly, this class included two founder variants
described as ‘‘hypomorphs,’’ R337H (Brazilian-centric),20 Y107H
(African-centric),21 as well as R181 C/H, which retain partial
wild-type p53 activities when tested in standard conditions
in vitro but cause a signiﬁcant risk for diverse cancers of the LF
spectrum in both children and adults. It has been suggested
that these variants may require synergistic alterations in other
pathways to express their full pathogenic potential. This hypothe-
sis is supported by the discovery that, in R337H carriers, an
inactivating variant of
the putative tumor suppressor XAF1
(E134*/Glu134Ter/rs146752602) enhances the risk of developing
sarcomas.22 Thus, class C may be enriched in incompletely inac-
tivating variants that require other genetic, epigenetic, or meta-
bolic/biochemical complementation to express their full patho-
genic potential. This hypothesis may account for the disparities
of SMS scores associated with these variants: their functional
impact in any particular cell-based assay may depend upon the
presence in these cells of factors required for complementing
the TP53 variant.

Class D represented a homogenous class of less severe vari-
ants that were associated with strongly attenuated LFS features.
These observations suggest carriage of a class D variant does
not in itself predispose to LFS. This hypothesis is supported by
the fact that pathogenic variants in other cancer predisposition
genes were more frequently detected in carriers of D variants
than in any other class. This suggests that, in carriers of D vari-
ants, cancer predisposition may be at least partially caused by
other pathogenic variants. However, further analysis is needed
since this information is not available for the majority of the
carriers documented in the dataset. Therefore, it cannot be
excluded that in speciﬁc contexts (e.g., genetic modiﬁers), at
least some class D variants may contribute to enhance the risk
of cancers of the LF spectrum. Thus, great care should be exer-
cised when considering such variants in genetic counseling.

This classiﬁcation provides insights into the concept of atten-
uation within the LF spectrum.5 The term aLFS has been coined
to identify an LF phenotype deﬁned by the presence of a germ-
line P/LP TP53 variant in a person with any cancer who does not
meet LFS genetic testing criteria and has no cancer diagnosed
before age 18 years. The YTA classiﬁcation did not identify a
unique YTA class matching this phenotypic deﬁnition. However,
there was a gradient in the proportion of individuals with aLFS
phenotype from class 0 or A (<17%–21%) to class C or D
(>50%–61%)
(Figure 4J). Remarkably, even among carriers
who met LFS genetic testing criteria, YTA classes underscored
a gradient of phenotypic attenuation, with carriers of B or C var-
iants presenting, on average, with a less severe phenotype than
carriers of A or 0 variants. Another key message is that risk atten-
uation in relation to YTA classes does not obey to a unique, linear
rule for all cancers that characterize the LF spectrum. In partic-
ular, carriers of B or C variants retain a risk for early ACC at least
equal to classes 0 and A, supporting that predisposition to this
cancer can be high even with relatively mild TP53 variants. In

ll

OPEN ACCESS

contrast, other signature LF cancers, such as OS, CPT, MB, or
RMS, were remarkably more prevalent in carriers of 0 or A than
in carriers of B, C, or D variant classes.

Overall, our integrative genotypic/phenotypic analysis pro-
vides an approach that complement, but does not supersedes,
expert curation efforts aimed at predicting individual and familial
risk in germline variant carriers, as well as a basis to identify
hypomorphic variants that require genetic or epigenetic modiﬁ-
cation to express their full pathogenic potential.

Limitations of the study
This study has several limitations. First, it does not take into ac-
count the fact that at least some mutations causing missense
variants may also cause aberrant mRNA splicing patterns,
resulting in loss of p53 protein expression. Such effects may
confer greater severity to variants currently solely interpreted
as missense. So far, these effects on splicing have not been eval-
uated in systematic functional assays. Second, it remains to be
determined whether the different classes A–D coincide with
distinct patterns of expression of p53 target genes, in particular
in normal cells and tissues of carriers of TP53 germline variants.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS

TP53 germline variant dataset
We analyzed the YTA classes on clinical data from the LF spectrum database R20 (germline TP53 variants), released in July 2019 and
hosted at the NCI (https://tp53.cancer.gov/).15 This database recapitulates clinical data of patients carrying TP53 germline variants.
The database contains data from 3,446 individuals (from 1,522 families) reported in the scientiﬁc literature since 1990. Individuals
carrying several TP53 variants were excluded from our analysis because of complexity to determine the contribution of individual
variants in these patients. Also, individuals carrying the TP53 p.R337H Brazilian variant who were not recruited through familial history
of cancer were removed, because of bias of analysis (in column ‘‘Ref_ID’’: 138, 196, 259, 323 and 400 were selected in the LF spec-
trum database). Individuals carrying TP53 missense variants were dispatched in groups corresponding to the YTA classes (A, B, C,
D). The remaining individuals, carrying non-missense variants were selected based on the type of effect of the variant in order to build
a class of reference containing non-functional (LOF) variants. We only kept nonsense and frameshift (ft) variants (from column ‘‘Ef-
fect’’) to consolidate a null class (named class 0) corresponding to disruption of the full-length protein.

TP53 germline variant validation datasets
Three validation cohorts originating from three different clinics were used to verify the consistency of our observations for the YTA
classes.

(1) The ‘‘LFS Registry in Hannover’’, Germany, recruits patients with a previously established diagnosis of LFS.24 Only patients

carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (according to Fortuno criteria) are included. N = 146 individuals.

(2) The ‘‘French LFS Cohort’’ has included germline missense TP53 variants from the French registry (Rouen, France) identiﬁed in

cancer patients who beneﬁted from TP53 analysis.1 N = 578 individuals.

(3) The ‘‘Toronto LFS Cohort’’, Canada, is a multi-institutional collection of data from patients and families carrying germline path-

ogenic variants that were referred to The Hospital for Sick Children.23 N = 97 individuals.

Ethics committee of Hannover Medical School, French National Ethics Committee, and Ethics committee of the Hospital for Sick

Children gave approval for this work.

Iterative clustering on YTA dataset
We retrieved transactivation scores from 2,314 TP53 variants12 on eight TP53 promoters (WAF1nWT, MDM2nWT, BAXnWT,
h1433snWT, AIP1nWT, GADD45nWT, NOXAnWT, P53R2nWT). We performed hierarchical Ward clustering in R v3.6.1 with Euclidean
distance, and chose three clusters. We performed a second iteration of clustering in the sub-clusters including more than 50 muta-
tions. Up to three layers of clustering iterations were processed. A total of 16 distinct clusters were thus deﬁned. Dendrograms were
retrieved with dendextend package, and heatmaps were built using pheatmap package. Final groups of clusters (YTA classes) were
deﬁned via the following approach: the most disrupted variants (cluster 1_1_1) were assigned to class A; variants of the upper layer
(layer 1_1 except cluster 1_1_1) were deﬁned as class B; variants of the next upper layer (layer 1 except the layer 1_1) were deﬁned as
class C; ﬁnally, the less disrupted variants (all variants except layer 1) were deﬁned as class D.

Clustering on human cells assays
Data from cell-based saturation mutation screens of TP53 variants in A549 cells were used.11 We extracted three metrics for each the
2,314 TP53 variants of the YTA dataset: A549 p53WT Nutlin.3 Z.score, A549 p53NULL Nutlin.3 Z.score and A549 p53NULL Etopo-
side Z.score. We performed Ward clustering in R v4.2.2 with Euclidean distance (k = 3; clusters G1, G2 and G3). Dendrogram was
retrieved with ape package.

Correlations between YTA classes and predictors of variant deleteriousness
We confronted our classes to various scores attributed to TP53: the transactivation classes as previously deﬁned by the analysis of
transactivation in yeast assays,12 the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) database (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg),17 the Align
Grantham Variation Grantham Deviation (AGVGD) database (http://agvgd.hci.utah.edu),16 the TP53 prediction of functionality
(TP53_PROF),18 the TP53 functionality scores obtained in human cell lines11,13 and the ClinVar database which aggregates informa-
tion about genomic variation and its relationship to human health (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar).25 The confrontation of the
classes with the various TP53 scores was performed using Pareto Plot or Pie Chart representations for categorical values and Scat-
tered Plots and Violin Plots for numerical values (R, ggplot2 package). Cancer accrual of the subgroups of each YTA class was
analyzed and the median age and statistical differences were extracted similar to YTA class comparison.

Mapping of YTA classes to p53 protein structure
The distribution of TP53 mutated residues along the TP53 sequence and domains was analyzed for each YTA class. Heatmaps were
used to highlight the pattern of distribution of variants along TP53 sequence in the different YTA classes (R, package pheatmap). The
proportion of variants within each TP53 domain is depicted using cumulative histograms (R, package ggplot2). The localization of
mutations in the p53 protein structure was assessed using the software ChimeraX28 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax) together
with PDB ﬁles of the TP53 binding domain 3KMD29 and the TP53 tetramerization domain 1C26,30 as well as the alpha-fold modelized
structure.31

Distribution of YTA classes in germline and somatic TP53 variant datasets
The occurrence of TP53 variants assigned to YTA classes was assessed in different databases: tumor-based variants in the Cosmic
database v97 (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic),26 normal sample-based variants in the gnomAD database v3.1.2 (https://
gnomad.broadinstitute.org),27 and TP53 germline variants database R20 released in July 2019 and hosted at the NCI (https://
tp53.cancer.gov/).15 We used the protein mutation information in the databases to analyze the distribution of variants into YTA
classes. Pie charts are used to show distribution of variant classes in the different databases, and numerical counts are indicated
(R, ggplot2 package).

Genotype-phenotype correlations
Lifetime cancer accrual for the YTA classes was assessed using the age of ﬁrst cancer onset or the cancer-free age of an individual.
Patients without age indication were not considered for this analysis. The age of median cancer accrual (and conﬁdence intervals at
95%) was extracted and a Log Rank Mantel-Cox test was run to assess the signiﬁcance of differences between groups. For multiple
pairwise comparisons, a correction was applied to extract an adjusted p-value (Bonferroni method). These analyses were performed
using R and the survival and survminer packages. Information about individuals’ sex was retrieved in the corresponding column
‘‘Sex’’. The proportion of individuals with multiple cancers versus individuals with one cancer was assessed for each YTA class.
The proportion of cancer-free individuals compared to individuals with cancer was assessed for each class. Tumor distribution
was determined in the YTA classes by analyzing all tumors described in the dataset (primary and secondary malignancies). We
used information about cancer organs and subtypes available in the LF spectrum database (columns ‘‘Topography’’ and
‘‘Morphology’’), and we consolidated groups based on organs of interest for the study of LFS (adrenal gland, brain, bone, soft tissue,
breast, hematopoietic system, and the mix of all other organs) as well as speciﬁc cancer types (ACC, OS, CPT, MB, glioblastoma,
phyllodes tumors, and RMS). Graphical representation of proportions of tumor types was performed using R (package ggplot2). The
distribution of tumor topologies was compared between YTA classes by using logistic model based on Khi2 statistic (multiple

pairwise comparison) to calculate a risk ratio (RR), conﬁdence intervals at 95% (CI 95% low and CI 95% high) and adjusted p-value
(correction for multiple comparisons by Benjamini-Hochberg method at 5% FDR level) using R software. Mapping of age-speciﬁc
tumor distribution within YTA classes was assessed by generating rain-cloud plots (R, package ggplot2). Finally, the relationship be-
tween YTA classes and the clinical deﬁnitions of LFS was evaluated using the LFS spectrum classiﬁcation5 and the column ‘‘Class’’
from the IARC/NCI database, to build bar-plots of proportions of individuals within each clinical class.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Statistical analyses were performed with the software R. Details on statistical tests, adjustments and speciﬁc packages used for data
presentation are given in each Methods section and in Figure legends.
