We used a clustering method to assign TP53 missense variants to classes based on their functional activities in experimental assays assessing biological p53 functions. Correlations with LFS phenotypes were analyzed using the public germline TP53 mutation database and validated in three LFS clinical cohorts. Class A carriers recapitulated all phenotypic traits of fully penetrant LFS, whereas class B carriers showed a slightly less penetrant form dominated by speciﬁc cancers, consistent with the notion that these classes identify variants with distinct functional properties. Class C displayed a lower lifetime cancer risk associated with attenuated LFS features, consistent with the notion that these variants have hypomorphic features. Class D carriers showed low lifetime cancer risks inconsistent with LFS deﬁnitions. This classiﬁcation of TP53 variants provides insights into structural/functional features causing pathogenicity. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS; Mendelian Inheritance in Man #151623) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome associated with a high lifetime risk of a broad spectrum of cancers caused by pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) TP53 germline (or mosaic) variants, 80% of which are missense.1 Typically, LFS occurs in three phases, (1) a childhood phase (0–17 years), characterized by a quartet of early life cancers (adrenocortical carcinoma [ACC], choroid plexus tumor [CPT], medulloblastoma [MB], and rhabdomyosarcoma [RMS], all of which occur almost exclusively before the age of ten years), and a high risk of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), osteosarcoma (OS), and central nervous system tumors (CNS) in adolescence; (2) an early adult phase (18–45 years), characterized by premenopausal breast cancer, multiple STS, and CNS; and (3) a late adult phase (over 45 years), characterized by lung adenocarcinoma, STS, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer.2 Clinical deﬁnitions are traditionally based on so-called ‘‘classic’’ LFS criteria,3 whereas revised Chompret criteria4 capture the broad spectrum of LFS-related cancers and are aimed at identifying patients for TP53 mutation testing. Based on clinical phenotypes, two forms of LFS have been identiﬁed, with (1) LFS, deﬁned by the presence of a P/LP TP53 variant in persons/families meeting LFS testing criteria or with cancer <18 years; and (2) attenuated LFS (aLFS), deﬁned by the presence of a P/LP TP53 variant in a person/family who does not meet LFS testing criteria.5 This phenotypic distinction provides a framework for further investigating subtle differences in genotype-phenotype correlations by classifying TP53 variants according to their pathogenicity. The p53 protein is a multi-functional transcription factor regulating a complex network of cellular and systemic anti-proliferative responses.6–8 Loss of these functions, often caused by inactivating missense mutations in the TP53 gene, impairs several iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 ª 2024 The Authors.

Many missense variants cause stable protein expression, which, in addition to LOF, may exert dominant-negative effects (DNEs) over wild-type allele products and have also been proposed to exert a number of pro-oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) effects documented in experimental cell and animal models,10 the phenotypic consequences of which remain unclear in the context of LFS. Large-scale systematic studies have assessed the impact of thousands of missense variants on biochemical and biological p53 protein functions in yeast or cell-based experimental assays.11–13 This wealth of information, together with carriers’ phenotypic traits, is used by the ClinGen TP53 expert panel to inform variant interpretation for clinical purposes (https:// clinicalgenome.org/afﬁliation/50013/).14 However, the precise correlations between the functional features of TP53 variants and clinical LFS phenotypes have not been systematically addressed. In the present study, we develop a classiﬁcation of TP53 missense variants into 4 functional classes that correspond to distinct cancer phenotypes, using as primary criteria the high-resolution clustering of the functional dataset developed by C. Ishioka and collaborators in a yeast-based transactivation assay (YTA).12 This dataset has systematically measured the transactivation capacity of a total of 2,314 missense variants toward synthetic reporters controlled by eight different p53 DNA response elements, thus providing eight different ‘‘mugshots’’ for each variant that score quantitative differences in their transactivation capacity but also highlight qualitative features in their capacity to distinguish among promoters that have not been systematically exploited for variant classiﬁcation so far. Next, we have challenged the robustness of the classes based on YTA clusters in predicting LFS phenotypes by interpolating them with clusters based on saturation mutagenesis screens (SMSs) of p53 suppressor activity in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type and null cell lines11 (Figure 1). Overall, this two-step approach supports the deﬁnition of four functional classes of missense TP53 variants (A, B, C, and D). To precisely assess their associations with LFS phenotypes, we have compared these classes with nonsense/frameshift variants (class 0) predicted as completely inactivating the p53 protein. Mapping these classes on phenotypic LFS data from the public repository of germline TP53 variants curated at NCI (revealed that each class is associated with speciﬁc phenotypic traits within the LFS spectrum. Our results provide a reﬁned resolution of genotype-phenotype correlations in LFS as well as insights on structural/functional features that specify variant pathogenicity. YTA TP53 variant classes Figure 1 outlines the strategy for classifying TP53 variants into functional classes and evaluating their correlations with cancer 2 iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 iScience Article phenotypes in TP53 mutation carriers. The list of TP53 missense variants and corresponding classes and clusters is presented in Table S1. Iterative clustering of the YTA dataset identiﬁed a total of 16 clusters of various sizes based on variant similarities in their capacity to bind and activate each of the eight promoters containing different versions of p53 DNA consensus elements (from 613 variants in cluster 2_2_1 to 5 variants in cluster 3) (Figures S1 and S2A). The ﬁrst layer of clustering broadly separated variants with signiﬁcant loss of activity (cluster 1) from ‘‘supertrans’’ variants (cluster 3) and variants retaining levels of activities similar to those of wild-type p53 (cluster 2). Further layers of clustering separated, distinct variant subgroups among clusters 1 and 2. Speciﬁcally, cluster 1 was resolved into 6 clusters, including variants ranging from quasi-complete loss of transcriptional activity toward all promoters (cluster 1_1_1, ‘‘triple_1’’) to variable levels or activity toward some, but not all, promoter sequences (among which the largest clusters were 1_1_3 and 1_3_1 and 1_3_2). Thus this clustering approach could resolve variants into a diversity of structure-function-mutation subgroups based on their qualitative and quantitative transcriptional similarities. To map these clusters onto the distribution of germline TP53 mutations, we grouped them into four classes (A to D), broadly reﬂecting a gradient of activity with A having the lowest overall transcriptional activity and D the highest, and B and C displaying intermediate and heterogeneous activities toward different reporters (Figure S2). These four YTA classes differed in variant distribution within the p53 protein structure (Figures 2A and S3) and in their predicted structural/functional effects (Figure S4). When compared with biophysical prediction scores (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant, Align Grantham Variation and Grantham Deviation)16,17 and integrative structural and functional scores,18 classes highlighted a gradient from A to D, with A and B being enriched in deleterious and non-functional features while C and D were enriched in non-deleterious and functional features. Class A included all common TP53 cancer mutation hotspots and was enriched in variants at residues located within the surface of the p53 protein in direct contact with DNA, in structural elements supporting the DNA-binding surface, or in structural motifs required for the cohesion of the p53 tetramerization domain. Class B included variants mapping to the DBD of p53, albeit at different residues than class A, mostly located within deﬁned sections of the beta-sheets that constitute the scaffold of the DBD as well as in loops exposed at the surface of the protein but not within its DNA-binding surface. Class C and D were enriched in variants that mapped to the N terminus or to the extreme C terminus of p53. These sites were poorly represented in other classes. Figure 2B shows the distribution of classes A–D in three TP53 variant datasets: cancer-related germline variants (NCI; https:// tp53.cancer.gov/), cancer-related somatic variants (COSMIC; and non-cancer-related germline variants (gnomAD; org/). Class A variants were enriched by factors of 4.5- and 3.3-fold in the COSMIC and NCI datasets, respectively, but were counter-selected (0.2-fold) in the gnomAD dataset. Likewise, albeit to a lesser extent, class B variants showed positive selection in COSMIC (1.1) and NCI (1.3) datasets, but not in 1 2 3 4 5 iScience Article Yeast-assay based transcriptional activity (YTA) scores for missense TP53 variants Iterative Ward clustering of YTA scores in 4 functional missense variant classes (A-B-C-D) Development of variant class 0 including nonsense and frameshift variants Correlations between YTA classes and predictors of variant deleteriousness; mapping onto p53 structure Genotype-phenotype correlations: between YTA classes and cancer spectrum in germline TP53 variant carriers (n= 3446 carriers; NCI/IARC TP53 database) Clustering of functional human cell-based saturation mutagenesis (SMS) scores Interpolation of variant YTA classes and SMS clusters : correlations with cancer phenotypes in the Li-Fraumeni Spectrum ll OPEN ACCESS Figure 1. Strategy for classifying TP53 variants into functional classes and evaluating their correlations with cancer phenotypes in TP53 mutation carriers First, we used hierarchical Ward’s clustering to interrogate the yeast-based transcriptional activity (2,314 variants, YTA dataset).12 This dataset approach identiﬁed four YTA classes (A to D) consistent with predictors of deleteriousness and reﬂecting a gradient of transcriptional activity from A (lowest activity) to D (quasi-identical to wild-type). We also created class 0, including nonsense and frameshift variants (p53 null genotype). Next, we analyzed lifetime cancer accrual and tumor patterns associated with each class using familial and individual data from the NCI germline TP53 mutation database (Third, we interpolated each class with clusters of functional scores from the human cell suppression saturation mutagenesis screens dataset (8,252 variants, SMS dataset) developed by Hahn and collaborators.11 Fourth, we assessed the signiﬁcance and limitations of YTA classes by examining their concordance with ClinVar expert panel annotations (https:// clinicalgenome.org/afﬁliation/50013/). Finally, we validated the proposed variant classiﬁcation in three cohorts of carriers recruited in high-risk cancer predisposition clinics in Germany, France, and Canada (n = 821). See also Figures S1 and S2, and Table S1. Concordance between YTA classes and ClinVar expert panel variant annotations (n = 58 variants) Validation of phenotype/genotype correlations in 3 clinical cohorts of germline TP53 carriers (n = 821 carriers) gnomAD (0.2). In contrast, class D variants were enriched in gnomAD (1.8) and counter-selected in COSMIC (0.1) and NCI (0.2), whereas class C was not enriched in any of the datasets. These results are compatible with the notion that classes A to D correspond to a gradient of cancer-related p53 dysfunction. YTA classes are associated with distinct phenotypic patterns within the LF spectrum To explore the correlations between YTA classes and tumor phenotypes within the broad Li-Fraumeni (LF) spectrum, we analyzed lifetime cancer accrual and tumor patterns using data compiled in the NCI germline TP53 mutation database (https:// tp53.cancer.gov/),15 a repository of germline variants detected in subjects (n = 3,446) from 1,522 families. For comparing the missense variants with strict LOF variants, we constructed a class ‘‘zero’’ (0) that included variants considered as ‘‘null’’ for p53, i.e., nonsense and frameshift variants that preclude the synthesis of a functional p53 protein (Figure S5). Class 0 includes variants considered to have exclusively LOF effects and thus provides a reference to evaluate possible DNEs and GOF effects carried by missense variants in classes A to D. Figure 3A shows that class A variants were found in 1,426 (53%) patients, followed by class 0 (552, 21%), B (290, 11%), C (242, 9%), and D (171, 6%). Gender distribution differed among classes, with a lower proportion of males in classes B, C, and D (31.4%, 26.7%, and 32%, respectively) than in classes 0 and A (40.9% and 40.6%, respectively) (Figure 3B). With respect to lifetime cancer accrual, classes 0 and A were associated with the most severe proﬁles (median age at ﬁrst diagnosis = 28 years) (Figures 3C–3E). Classes C and D were associated with attenuated accrual proﬁles (median age = 41 years), whereas class B showed an intermediate and distinct proﬁle (median age = 33 years), characterized by rapid accrual during childhood (similar to classes A and 0) and slower accrual during adolescence and adulthood. This gradient of pathogenicity was reﬂected in the proportion of carriers with multiple cancers as well as cancer free (Figures 3F and 3G) iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 3 ll OPEN ACCESS iScience Article All TP53 missense variants (n=2,314) Kato yeast assay (all TP53 missense variants) gnomAD counts (normal sample based TP53 variants) Cosmic counts (tumor based TP53 variants) Dataset IARC/NCI counts (TP53 germline variants) A B y c n e u q e r F s t n a i r a v f o A 402 (17.4%) B 208 (9.0%) C 671 (29.0%) D 1033 (44.64%) A 38 (3.2%) B 18 (1.5%) C 159 (13.2%) D 987 (82.1%) A 27397 (78.1%) B 3498 (10.0%) C 2389 (6.8%) D 1812 (5.1%) A 624 (57.5%) B 131 (12.1%) C 231 (21.3%) D 99 (9.1%) Figure 2.

Of note, variants in established cancer predisposition genes other than TP53 were more frequently found in carriers of class D variants than in carriers of any other variant class (Figure 3H). Comparison across classes revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences in tumor patterns (Figures 4, S6, and S7; Table S2). Classes 0 and A shared topological and morphological tumor patterns that recapitulated the broad phenotype of the LF spectrum. This included LFS signature cancers such as childhood ACC, CPT, RMS, and MB, teenage OS, and early breast phyllodes cancers. There were, however, small but statistically signiﬁcant differences between 0 and A, the latter presenting with a higher proportion of brain cancers (risk ratio [RR] = 1.53, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] [1.16–2.05]), including in particular CPT (Figures 4B, 4C, and S6; Table S2) compared to class 0. Compared to 0 and A, class B showed a slightly delayed median age of tumor onset as compared to classes 0 and A as well as a smaller proportion of most cancers that deﬁne the LF spectrum (Figures 4B, 4C, and S6), except ACC (RR B vs. A = 2.74 (95% CI [1.78; 4.14]); RR B vs. 0 = 3.12 (95% CI [1.84–5.34]) (Table S2). Indeed, in class B, ACC was the most common cancer form before the age of 10 and was responsible for the rapid cancer accrual in early life (Figure 3C) despite the rarity of other childhood signature cancers (i.e., RMS and MB) (Figure S6). Compared to A, class B also showed a higher proportion of cancer-free carriers (Figure 3G) and differences in the predominant forms of CNS cancers (mostly glioblastomas) (Figures 4B and S6). Compared to 0, A, and B, class C presented with an attenuated risk of all cancers of the LF spectrum, except ACC (RR C vs. A = 2.05 (95% CI [1.20–3.34]) and breast cancers (BCs) (RR C vs. A = 1.75 (95% CI [1.32–2.31]) (Figures 4B, 4C, and S6, Table S2). In contrast, class C carriers rarely presented with OS, CPT, RMS, or MB compared to class 0 and A (Figure S6). Class C also presented with a higher proportion of cancer-free carriers than any other class (Figure 3G). Finally, class D included low penetrance variants, with signature LF cancers such as early ACC, CPT, MB, OS, and phyllodes tumors of the breast being, if 4 iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 iScience Article A Individuals with TP53 germline variants C B D F Multiple pairwise comparison of cancer accrual E G H I J ll OPEN ACCESS Figure 3.

The most frequent early cancers in D were hematopoietic malignancies, which are common sporadic neoplasia in children, independently of germline TP53 status. Class D variants retained quasi-wild-type p53 transcriptional properties for at least half of the YTA promoters tested, consistent with enrichment in variants annotated as benign or likely benign (B/LB) by ClinVar. Overall, classes 0 and A were associated with the most severe forms of LFS, class B showed a slightly less penetrant form with ACC as the most frequent early life cancer, class C corresponded to an attenuated form predisposing to at least some cancers of the LF spectrum (ACC and BC), whereas class D did not appear to carry a signiﬁcant risk for typical LF cancers (Figure 4C). Dissecting YTA variant classes with functional scores from human cell-based assays Despite their sensitivity for capturing subtle structural differences in DNA interactions caused by mutations, YTA screens may lack the physiological relevance of human cell-based assays aimed at directly evaluating the capacity of p53 variants to suppress cell growth. To challenge the robustness of YTA classes in the light of human cell-based functional data, we have interpolated them with a functional score developed in iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 5 ll OPEN ACCESS Giacomelli et al11 (phenotypic selection model; SMS dataset). Figure 5A shows that this score was broadly consistent with YTA classes, with A having the highest and D the lowest median score. However, individual variant scores were widely distributed within each class. To further assess this heterogeneity, we applied Ward clustering using the three phenotypic enrichment scores in the SMS dataset. These scores evaluate the capacity of TP53 variants to either suppress cell growth or maintain cell viability either in the presence or absence of wild-type TP53, thus providing metrics to assess LOF and DNE.

Interpolating G clusters with YTA classes showed that both class A and B included predominantly G1 and G2 variants, albeit in different proportions, whereas class C and D contained predominantly of G2 and G3 variants (Figure 5C). When applied to lifetime cancer accrual in germline TP53 carriers, the 3 G clusters enable separating two phenotypic groups, corresponding to more (G1) or less severe (G2 and G3) cancer predisposition traits, however without clearly separating distinct LF phenotypes (Figure 5E). We next evaluated the phenotypic heterogeneity of each YTA class (A–D) by separating them according to SMS clusters (G1–G3) (Figure 5E). This analysis revealed that YTA classes were remarkably robust, showing quasi-identical cancer accrual either for G1 and G2 variants in the A class or G2 and G3 variants in the D class. The only exception was a G3 variant in the A class, p.K305M, identiﬁed so far in only 1 family (3 adult patients) that did not match any LFS clinical criteria. Within class B and C, separation according to G clusters revealed signiﬁcant heterogeneity (p = 0.0076 for B and 0.00034 for C). Within each of these classes, variants of the G1 cluster tended to show a more severe phenotype than those of G2 and G3 clusters.

As supplementary data, we present additional analyses using another systematic human cell-based functional score developed by Kotler et al.13 (relative ﬁtness score; Figure S8) as well as a comparison between YTA classes and TP53_PROF, a machine learning model that integrates yeast, cell-based, and computational metrics developed by Ben-Cohen et al18 (Figure S9). Overall, these analyses further underlined the remarkable consistency between YTA classes and other metrics aimed at predicting the impact of missense mutations in p53. Clinical signiﬁcance of YTA classes ClinVar expert panel annotations (afﬁliation/50013/) are based on expert consensus review of genotype/phenotype correlations and are the current standard for interpreting TP53 germline variants for clinical purposes.14 However, these annotations cover only a proportion of all missense variants in the NCI germline dataset. We thus assessed the concordance between YTA classes and ClinVar expert panel as a ﬁrst step to determine whether YTA classes could assist in the clinical evaluation of variants that have not yet been annotated to date. Figure 6A shows that YTA classes were concordant with expert panel annotations, with A and B classes mostly represented among P/PL variants and C and D classes mostly represented among B/LB variants. The only exception was D49H, a YTA class A – SMS G2 (LOF) variant annotated as LB by ClinVar. This variant is documented in only one family (2 patients) that matched the LFS Chompret’s criteria (embryonal RMS of the cervix at 2 years and Hodgkin’s lymphoma at 15 years).19 Variants annotated as ‘‘Uncertain Signiﬁcance’’ were predominant in class C variants, followed by class B and D variants, suggesting that YTA classes may help in resolving ambiguities in variant annotations. Overall, YTA classes were remarkably consistent with expert panel annotations (p < 0.0001) (Figures 6B and 3C). Moreover, within classes A, B, and C, cancer accrual in carriers of non-expert panel variants was almost perfectly aligned with that of expert panel-curated variants (Figure 6C). Thus, YTA classes could adequately predict cancer accrual and phenotypes in subjects carrying variants not annotated by the expert panel. To further assess the robustness of YTA classes in a clinical context, we examined cancer accrual and tumor patterns in three independent cohorts of carriers recruited in different high-risk cancer predisposition clinics in Germany (n = 146, LFS Registry in Hannover), France (n = 578, French LFS cohort), and Canada (n = 97, Toronto LFS cohort). These cohorts are maintained and annotated mainly independently of the NCI germline dataset. Figure 7 shows that, in each cohort, YTA classes correctly predicted cancer accrual and distinguished among carriers with quantitative and qualitative differences in the LF spectrum. In all cohorts, class A carriers presented the most severe phenotype (similar to class 0 in the German and Canadian cohort). Compared to A, class B carriers had a distinct and less penetrant phenotype, characterized by high risk of earlylife ACC and slightly delayed overall cancer accrual. Class C carriers often had attenuated phenotypes, nevertheless including cancers typical of the LF spectrum (i.e., ACC and BC) but excluding most other signature LF childhood cancers, whereas in class D, tumor patterns tended to be more heterogeneous, with most of carriers not matching LF spectrum deﬁnitions (Figure S10). Overall, these observations support that YTA classes can help to predict speciﬁc patterns of risk in germline carriers and could be particularly helpful for assessing the risk of novel variants as well as variants not yet annotated by expert panels or ClinVar. This classiﬁcation of TP53 missense variants into 4 functional classes (A–D) supports a robust interpolation between genotypes (variant characteristics) and phenotypes (cancer risk and spectrum). The classiﬁcation correctly separated severe from mild or benign variants in all structural domains of the p53 protein, including transactivation domain, DBD, and tetramerization domain. The classiﬁcation is based on quantitative and qualitative similarities between variants in YTA and is remarkably consistent with human cell-based functional metrics from SMSs of TP53 variants. However, interpolating YTA classes with clustered SMS scores showed that YTA classes afforded superior precision in distinguishing variant carriers with distinct phenotypic features of LFS. Class A identiﬁed a group of severe variants that mostly fell within major structural motifs of the DBD of the p53 protein. Carriers of these variants recapitulated all phenotypic traits of severe LFS. Interestingly, tumor phenotypes in class A carriers were only marginally distinct from those or carriers of null/frameshift TP53 variants (class 0), the only difference being a higher proportion of CNS cancers in class A than in class 0 (RR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.16–2.05]). Likewise, separating class A variants into variants with DNEs (SMS cluster G1) or simply LOF (SMS cluster G2) did not reveal signiﬁcant differences in cancer accrual or phenotypic spectrum. These observations suggest that, in the context of LFS, LOF is the main, if not the only functional property of TP53 variants that causes disease severity and that mutant-speciﬁc effects such as DNEs or GOF effects play only minor, tissuespeciﬁc roles. Most class B variants were distributed within structural motifs of the DBD that are not in direct contact with DNA. These variants showed less severe structural and functional features than class A as well as a greater heterogeneity in their transcriptional activities, suggesting that they may partially retain wildtype activity toward a subset of promoters.

See also Figure S10. carriers were slightly and selectively attenuated as compared to A carriers, in particular during childhood and adolescence. Whereas early signature cancers such as RMS, CPT, MB, or OS were infrequent in class B carriers, the proportion of ACC was higher than in classes 0 and A. As a result, class B carriers show a distinct proﬁle of cancer accrual in early life, with high risk caused by ACC until age 9, followed by a period of relatively low risk between ages 10 and 20. The selectivity of class B variants for ACC suggests that perinatal adrenal cortical cells are exquisitely sensitive to wild-type p53 dosage and that variants 10 iScience 27, 111296, December 20, 2024 iScience Article mediating partial loss of wild-type p53 activity may sufﬁce to enhance the risk of early ACC. Class C included lower penetrance variants that nevertheless predisposed to cancers typical of the LF spectrum. This class was the most heterogeneous when interpolated with SMS clusters. Interestingly, this class included two founder variants described as ‘‘hypomorphs,’’ R337H (Brazilian-centric),20 Y107H (African-centric),21 as well as R181 C/H, which retain partial wild-type p53 activities when tested in standard conditions in vitro but cause a signiﬁcant risk for diverse cancers of the LF spectrum in both children and adults. It has been suggested that these variants may require synergistic alterations in other pathways to express their full pathogenic potential. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery that, in R337H carriers, an inactivating variant of the putative tumor suppressor XAF1 (E134*/Glu134Ter/rs146752602) enhances the risk of developing sarcomas.22 Thus, class C may be enriched in incompletely inactivating variants that require other genetic, epigenetic, or metabolic/biochemical complementation to express their full pathogenic potential. This hypothesis may account for the disparities of SMS scores associated with these variants: their functional impact in any particular cell-based assay may depend upon the presence in these cells of factors required for complementing the TP53 variant. Class D represented a homogenous class of less severe variants that were associated with strongly attenuated LFS features. These observations suggest carriage of a class D variant does not in itself predispose to LFS. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that pathogenic variants in other cancer predisposition genes were more frequently detected in carriers of D variants than in any other class. This suggests that, in carriers of D variants, cancer predisposition may be at least partially caused by other pathogenic variants. However, further analysis is needed since this information is not available for the majority of the carriers documented in the dataset. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that in speciﬁc contexts (e.g., genetic modiﬁers), at least some class D variants may contribute to enhance the risk of cancers of the LF spectrum. Thus, great care should be exercised when considering such variants in genetic counseling. This classiﬁcation provides insights into the concept of attenuation within the LF spectrum.5 The term aLFS has been coined to identify an LF phenotype deﬁned by the presence of a germline P/LP TP53 variant in a person with any cancer who does not meet LFS genetic testing criteria and has no cancer diagnosed before age 18 years. The YTA classiﬁcation did not identify a unique YTA class matching this phenotypic deﬁnition. However, there was a gradient in the proportion of individuals with aLFS phenotype from class 0 or A (<17%–21%) to class C or D (>50%–61%) (Figure 4J). Remarkably, even among carriers who met LFS genetic testing criteria, YTA classes underscored a gradient of phenotypic attenuation, with carriers of B or C variants presenting, on average, with a less severe phenotype than carriers of A or 0 variants. Another key message is that risk attenuation in relation to YTA classes does not obey to a unique, linear rule for all cancers that characterize the LF spectrum. In particular, carriers of B or C variants retain a risk for early ACC at least equal to classes 0 and A, supporting that predisposition to this cancer can be high even with relatively mild TP53 variants. In ll OPEN ACCESS contrast, other signature LF cancers, such as OS, CPT, MB, or RMS, were remarkably more prevalent in carriers of 0 or A than in carriers of B, C, or D variant classes. Overall, our integrative genotypic/phenotypic analysis provides an approach that complement, but does not supersedes, expert curation efforts aimed at predicting individual and familial risk in germline variant carriers, as well as a basis to identify hypomorphic variants that require genetic or epigenetic modiﬁcation to express their full pathogenic potential. Limitations of the study This study has several limitations. First, it does not take into account the fact that at least some mutations causing missense variants may also cause aberrant mRNA splicing patterns, resulting in loss of p53 protein expression. Such effects may confer greater severity to variants currently solely interpreted as missense. So far, these effects on splicing have not been evaluated in systematic functional assays. Second, it remains to be determined whether the different classes A–D coincide with distinct patterns of expression of p53 target genes, in particular in normal cells and tissues of carriers of TP53 germline variants.
