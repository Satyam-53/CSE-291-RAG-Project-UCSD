PURPOSE: We used targeted capture sequencing to analyze TP53-mutated circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer patients and to determine whether 
TP53 mutation has predictive value for anti-human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) treatment for in HER2 amplification-positive patients (HER2+) 
and HER2 mutation-positive, amplification-negative (HER2-/mut) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TP53 mutation features were analyzed in the Geneplus 
cohort (n = 1184). The MSK-BREAST cohort was used to explore the value of TP53 
mutation in predicting anti-HER-2 antibody efficacy. Sequencing of ctDNA in 
phase Ib, phase Ic, phase II clinical trials of pyrotinib (HER2+ patients), and 
an investigator-initiated phase II study of pyrotinib (HER2-/mut patients) were 
performed to analyze the relationships between TP53 mutation and prognosis for 
HER2 TKIs. The MSK-BREAST cohort, MutHER, and SUMMIT cohort were used for 
verification.
RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in 53.1% (629/1184) of patients in the 
Geneplus cohort. The TP53 mutation rate was higher in HR-negative (p < 0.001) 
and HER2 amplification-positive (p = 0.015) patients. Among patients receiving 
anti-HER2 antibody therapy, those whose tumors carried TP53 mutations had a 
shorter PFS (p = 0.004). However, the value of TP53 mutation in predicting HER2 
TKI response was inconsistent. In HER2+ patients, no difference in PFS was 
observed among patients with different TP53 statuses in the combined analysis of 
the pyrotinib phase Ib, phase Ic, and phase II clinical trials (p = 1.00) or in 
the MSK-BREAST cohort (p = 0.62). In HER2-/mut patients, TP53 mutation-positive 
patients exhibited a trend toward worse prognosis with anti-HER2 TKI treatment 
than TP53-wild-type patients in our investigator-initiated phase II study 
(p = 0.15), and this trend was confirmed in the combined analysis of the MutHER 
and SUMMIT cohorts (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutation can be used to identify biomarkers of anti-HER2 
antibody drug resistance in HER2+ patients and HER2 TKI resistance in HER2-/mut 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) demonstrated significant 
progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in Young Pearl, a randomized phase ll 
trial comparing palbociclib + ET versus capecitabine in premenopausal women with 
hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This 
exploratory analysis investigated potential biomarkers of palbociclib plus ET on 
PFS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 178 patients randomized (92 palbociclib plus ET; 86 
capecitabine), we performed targeted sequencing (141 patients) and whole 
transcriptome sequencing (165 patients) using baseline tumor samples to examine 
genomic alteration in relation to drug response on PFS. Hazard ratios (HRs) were 
estimated using unstratified Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: PIK3CA (41%) and TP53 (33%) mutations and CCND1 copy number variation 
(29%) were found most frequently in targeted sequencing of 141 patients. ESR1 
mutations were found only in 3.5% of patients of this population. Luminal type 
showed better prognosis in palbociclib + ET arm but no impact on PFS difference 
in capecitabine arm. High TMB, TP53 mutation, PTEN loss of function mutation and 
RB1 pathway alteration showed worse prognosis in palbociclib plus ET arm. 
Patients with BRCA2 pathogenic mutations showed worse prognosis regardless of 
PAM50 subtypes. AURKA mutation/amplification, BRIP1/MYC/RAD51C amplification 
were significantly associated to the patients with short PFS <6 month.
CONCLUSION: Of palbociclib plus ET, luminal type showed better prognosis and 
BRCA2 pathogenic mutation showed worse prognosis regardless luminal/non-luminal 
type. Further exploration of molecular variables is warranted to determine and 
validate biomarkers of efficacy and resistance.

The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) pathway is frequently activated in HER2-negative breast cancer and may 
play a role in taxane resistance. The phase IB/II TAKTIC trial (NCT01980277) has 
shown that combining a dual AKT and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) 
inhibitor (LY2780301) taken orally with weekly paclitaxel in HER2-negative 
advanced breast cancer is feasible, with preliminary evidence of efficacy. We 
wanted to explore whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be a surrogate 
marker of treatment efficacy in this setting. Serial plasma samples were 
collected and cell-free DNA was sequenced using low-coverage whole-genome 
sequencing, and analysis was completed with droplet digital polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) for some patients with driver mutations. Baseline tumor fraction 
(TF) and TF after 7 weeks on treatment were compared to progression-free 
survival (PFS) and the overall response rate. We also explored circulating copy 
number alterations associated with treatment failure. Of the 51 patients 
enrolled in the TAKTIC trial, at least one plasma sample was available for 44 
cases (96 timepoints). All patients with tumor TP53, PI3KCA, or AKT1 mutations 
harbored at least one of these alterations in plasma. TF at inclusion was 
correlated with PFS (6m-PFS was 92% for ctDNAneg patients vs 68% for ctDNApos 
cases; hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.34-8.90], 
P = 0.007). ctDNA status at week 7 was not correlated with prognosis. Even 
though most circulating copy number alterations were conserved at disease 
progression, some genomic regions of interest were altered in post-progression 
samples. In conclusion, ctDNA detection at baseline was associated with shorter 
PFS in patients included in the TAKTIC trial. Plasma-based copy number analysis 
may help to identify alterations involved in resistance to treatment.

The mutation status of tumor tissue DNA (n = 389) of resected stage II-III 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (Ns-NSCLC) was analyzed using targeted 
deep sequencing as an exploratory biomarker study (JIPANG-TR) for the JIPANG 
study, a randomized phase III study of pemetrexed/cisplatin (Pem/Cis) vs 
vinorelbine/cisplatin (Vnr/Cis). The TP53 mutation, common EGFR mutations (exon 
19 deletion and L858R), and KRAS mutations were frequently detected. The 
frequency of the EGFR mutation was significant among female patients. Patients 
with an EGFR mutation-positive status had a significantly shorter 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) time (24 mo vs not reached) (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 
1.22-2.21; P = .0011 for EGFR mutation status). Multivariable analysis 
identified both the pathological stage and EGFR mutation status as independent 
prognostic factors for RFS (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.30-2.44; P = .0003 for disease 
stage; and HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; P = .0050 for EGFR mutation status). 
This study demonstrated that the EGFR mutation has either a poor prognostic or 
predictive impact on a poor response to postoperative chemotherapy with platinum 
doublet chemotherapy for stage II-III Ns-NSCLC patients. This result supports a 
role for mandatory molecular diagnosis of early-stage Ns-NSCLC for precision 
oncology and signifies the importance of adjuvant for the 3rd generation 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor rather than platinum-based chemotherapy. This study is 
registered with the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN 000012237).

PURPOSE: This analysis evaluated the genomic landscape of premenopausal patients 
with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-negative advanced breast cancer and the association of genetic alterations 
with response to ribociclib in the phase III MONALEESA-7 trial.
METHODS: Premenopausal patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive endocrine 
therapy plus ribociclib or placebo. Plasma collected at baseline was sequenced 
using targeted next-generation sequencing for approximately 600 relevant cancer 
genes. The association of circulating tumor DNA alterations with 
progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated to identify biomarkers of response 
and resistance to ribociclib.
RESULTS: Baseline circulating tumor DNA was sequenced in 565 patients; 489 had 
evidence of ≥ 1 alteration. The most frequent alterations included PIK3CA (28%), 
TP53 (19%), CCND1 (10%), MYC (8%), GATA3 (8%), receptor tyrosine kinases (17%), 
and the Chr8p11.23 locus (12%). A treatment benefit of ribociclib was seen with 
wild-type (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.62]) and altered (HR 0.57 
[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.9]) PIK3CA. Overall, patients with altered CCND1 had shorter 
PFS regardless of treatment, suggesting CCND1 as a potential prognostic 
biomarker. Benefit with ribociclib was seen in patients with altered (HR 0.21 
[95% CI, 0.08 to 0.54]) or wild-type (HR 0.52 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.68]) CCND1, but 
greater benefit was observed with altered, suggesting predictive potential of 
CCND1. Alterations in TP53, MYC, Chr8p11.23 locus, and receptor tyrosine kinases 
were associated with worse PFS, but ribociclib benefit was independent of 
alteration status.
CONCLUSION: In this study-to our knowledge, the first large study of 
premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer-multiple genomic alterations 
were associated with poor outcome. A PFS benefit of ribociclib was observed 
regardless of gene alteration status, although in this exploratory analysis, a 
magnitude of benefits varied by alteration.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy for breast cancer is an unmet clinical need. We hypothesised that 
tumour subclones showing expansion in residual disease after chemotherapy would 
contain mutations conferring drug resistance.
METHODS: We studied oestrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor-positive, 
HER2-negative tumours from 42 patients in the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 trial who 
failed to achieve a pathological complete response. Genes commonly mutated in 
breast cancer were sequenced in pre and post-treatment samples.
RESULTS: Oncogenic driver mutations were commonest in PIK3CA (38% of tumours), 
GATA3 (29%), CDH1 (17%), TP53 (17%) and CBFB (12%); and amplification was 
commonest for CCND1 (26% of tumours) and FGFR1 (26%). The variant allele 
fraction frequently changed after treatment, indicating that subclones had 
expanded and contracted, but there were changes in both directions for all of 
the commonly mutated genes.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that expansion of clones containing recurrent 
oncogenic driver mutations is responsible for resistance to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. The persistence of classic oncogenic mutations in pathways for 
which targeted therapies are now available highlights their importance as drug 
targets in patients who have failed chemotherapy but provides no support for a 
direct role of driver oncogenes in resistance to chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: There are limited data on trastuzumab-pertuzumab (HP)-based treatments 
beyond the first-line, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting. We 
conducted a phase II study of eribulin mesylate, which extends survival in MBC, 
with HP in patients with previously treated HER2+ MBC to evaluate efficacy, 
toxicity, and genomic alterations driving therapeutic response.
METHODS: After a run-in phase for eribulin dosing, two cohorts were enrolled 
(Cohort A-no prior pertuzumab; Cohort B-prior pertuzumab). All patients received 
eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 with standard-dose HP on day 1 (21-day cycles). 
The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Genomic characterization 
via whole exome sequencing (WES) was completed on tumor DNA and matched germline 
DNA from 19 patients.
RESULTS: The six-patient run-in established a dose of eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 with 
HP. Cohorts A and B enrolled 17 and 7 patients, respectively. Accrual stopped 
early due to an evolving treatment landscape and slow enrollment. The ORR was 
26.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 9.2-51.2%) in Cohort A and 0% in Cohort B 
(95% CI 0-41.0%). WES revealed more frequent alterations in TP53 (p < 0.05, 
q > 0.05) in patients without clinical benefit (disease control for < 24 weeks) 
which was not significant after multiple hypothesis correction.
CONCLUSION: Eribulin-HP had manageable toxicity and modest clinical activity in 
patients without prior pertuzumab exposure. This study provides a preliminary 
landscape of somatic alterations in this patient cohort. Our data add to the 
literature on how genomic alterations may predict for therapy 
response/resistance, as we work to individualize choices in a quickly evolving 
HER2+ MBC treatment landscape.

PURPOSE: Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who do not achieve 
pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a 
high risk of recurrence and death. Molecular characterization may identify 
patients unlikely to achieve pCR. This neoadjuvant trial was conducted to 
determine the pCR rate with docetaxel and carboplatin and to identify molecular 
alterations and/or immune gene signatures predicting pCR.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with clinical stages II/III TNBC received 6 cycles 
of docetaxel and carboplatin. The primary objective was to determine if 
neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin would increase the pCR rate in TNBC 
compared to historical expectations. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
and immune profiling on pre-treatment tumor samples to identify alterations that 
may predict pCR. Thirteen matching on-treatment samples were also analyzed to 
assess changes in molecular profiles.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 127 (45.7%) patients achieved pCR. There was a 
non-significant trend toward higher mutation burden for patients with residual 
cancer burden (RCB) 0/I versus RCB II/III (median 80 versus 68 variants, p 
0.88). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene, observed in 85.7% of tumors. 
EGFR, RB1, RAD51AP2, SDK2, L1CAM, KPRP, PCDHA1, CACNA1S, CFAP58, COL22A1, and 
COL4A5 mutations were observed almost exclusively in pre-treatment samples from 
patients who achieved pCR. Seven mutations in PCDHA1 were observed in 
pre-treatment samples from patients who did not achieve pCR. Several immune gene 
signatures including IDO1, PD-L1, interferon gamma signaling, CTLA4, 
cytotoxicity, tumor inflammation signature, inflammatory chemokines, cytotoxic 
cells, lymphoid, PD-L2, exhausted CD8, Tregs, and immunoproteasome were 
upregulated in pre-treatment samples from patients who achieved pCR.
CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin resulted in a pCR of 45.7%. 
WES and immune profiling differentiated patients with and without pCR.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Somatic mutations were investigated in 21 patients with 
postmenopausal estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive (ER+HER2+) breast cancer (BC) treated with 
neoadjuvant letrozole and lapatinib, to identify their distinct molecular 
landscape.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used tissue samples of 21 patients from phase II Neo 
ALL-IN cohort, and somatic alterations were examined using targeted exome 
sequencing performed in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI).
RESULTS: TP53 (61.9%) and PIK3CA (57.1%) were the two most frequently mutated 
genes that were inter-correlated (p=0.026). They were associated with 
unfavorable clinical outcomes, particularly when accompanying PIK3CA mutations 
at exon 9 in helical domains. Meanwhile, MLL2 alteration was negatively 
associated with mutations of TP53 or PIK3CA, and it tended to be present in 
patients with low KI-67 levels and no initial nodal involvement. Moreover, 
patients with MLL2 mutations numerically showed more favorable overall response 
rates (ORR) (80% vs. 56.2%) and better 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates 
(100% vs. 87.5%) compared to the wild-type.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA hotspot at exon 9 may be potential 
negative predictors of ER+HER2+ BC treated with neoadjuvant letrozole and 
lapatinib, while MLL2 inactivating mutation might confer therapeutic benefit in 
these patients.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy reduces breast cancer mortality by 40%, but 
resistance remains a major clinical problem. In this study, we sought to 
investigate the impact of aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy on gene expression 
and identify gene modules representing key biological pathways that relate to 
early AI therapy resistance.
METHODS: Global gene expression was measured on pairs of core-cut biopsies taken 
at baseline and at surgery from 254 patients with ER-positive primary breast 
cancer randomised to receive 2-week presurgical AI (n = 198) or no presurgical 
treatment (control n = 56) from the POETIC trial. Data from the AI group was 
adjusted to eliminate artefactual process-related changes identified in the 
control group. The response was assessed by changes in the proliferation marker, 
Ki67.
RESULTS: High baseline ESR1 expression associated with better AI response in 
HER2+ tumours but not HER2- tumours. In HER2- tumours, baseline expression of 48 
genes associated with poor antiproliferative response (p < 0.005) including PERP 
and YWHAQ, the two most significant, and the transcription co-regulators 
(SAP130, HDAC4, and NCOA7) which were among the top 16 most significant. 
Baseline gene signature scores measuring cell proliferation, growth factor 
signalling (ERBB2-GS, RET/GDNF-GS, and IGF-1-GS), and immune activity (STAT1-GS) 
were significantly higher in poor AI responders. Two weeks of AI caused 
downregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and ER signalling, as 
expected. Signature scores of E2F activation and TP53 dysfunction after 2-week 
AI were associated with poor AI response in both HER2- and HER2+ patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high degree of heterogeneity in adaptive mechanisms 
after as little as 2-week AI therapy; however, all appear to converge on cell 
cycle regulation. Our data support the evaluation of whether an E2F signatures 
after short-term exposure to AI may identify those patients most likely to 
benefit from the early addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Background This open-label, first-in-human, phase 1 study evaluated AMG 232, an 
oral selective MDM2 inhibitor in patients with TP53 wild-type (P53WT), advanced 
solid tumors or multiple myeloma (MM). Methods In the dose escalation (n = 39), 
patients with P53WT refractory solid tumors enrolled to receive once-daily AMG 
232 (15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 960 mg) for seven days every 3 weeks (Q3W). 
In the dose expansion (n = 68), patients with MDM2-amplified 
(well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcomas [WDLPS and DDLPS], 
glioblastoma multiforme [GBM], or other solid tumors [OST]), MDM2-overexpressing 
ER+ breast cancer (BC), or MM received AMG 232 at the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD). Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy were assessed. 
Results AMG 232 had acceptable safety up to up to 240 mg. Three patients had 
dose-limiting toxicities of thrombocytopenia (n = 2) and neutropenia (n = 1). 
Due to these and other delayed cytopenias, AMG 232 240 mg Q3W was determined as 
the highest tolerable dose assessed in the dose expansion. Adverse events were 
typically mild/moderate and included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, and anemia. AMG 232 plasma concentrations increased dose 
proportionally. Increases in serum macrophage inhibitor cytokine-1 from baseline 
were generally dose dependent, indicating p53 pathway activation. Per local 
review, there were no responses. Stable disease (durability in months) was 
observed in patients with WDLPS (3.9), OST (3.3), DDLPS (2.0), GBM (1.8), and BC 
(1.4-2.0). Conclusions In patients with P53WT advanced solid tumors or MM, AMG 
232 showed acceptable safety and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and stable 
disease was observed.
