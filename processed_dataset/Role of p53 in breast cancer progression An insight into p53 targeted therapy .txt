Abstract 

The  transcription  factor  p53  is  an  important  regulator  of  a  multitude  of  cellular  processes.  In  the 
presence of genotoxic stress, p53 is activated to facilitate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In 
breast  cancer,  the  tumor  suppressive  activities  of  p53  are  frequently  inactivated  by  either  the 
overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2, or mutation which is present in 30-35% of all breast 
cancer cases. Notably, the frequency of p53 mutation is highly subtype dependent in breast cancers, with 
majority  of  hormone  receptor-positive  or  luminal  subtypes  retaining  the  wild-type  p53  status  while 
hormone receptor-negative patients predominantly carry p53 mutations with gain-of-function oncogenic 
activities that contribute to poorer prognosis. Thus, a two-pronged strategy of targeting wild-type and 
mutant  p53  in  different  subtypes  of  breast  cancer  can  have  clinical  relevance.  The  development  of 
p53-based therapies has rapidly progressed in recent years, and include unique small molecule chemical 
inhibitors, stapled peptides, PROTACs, as well as several genetic-based approaches using vectors and 
engineered antibodies. In this review, we highlight the therapeutic strategies that are in pre-clinical and 
clinical  development  to  overcome  p53  inactivation  in  both  wild-type  and  mutant  p53-bearing  breast 
tumors, and discuss their efficacies and limitations in pre-clinical and clinical settings.

Introduction 

Physiological functions of p53 in cancer 

Introduction to p53 

The 

tumor 

suppressor  p53 

is  a  major 
transcription  factor  involved  in  the  regulation  of 
several  cellular  functions.  In  cancer,  p53  attenuates 
cell  proliferation  in  response  to  various  stimuli, 
including  DNA  damage,  nutrient  deprivation,  hypo-
xia,  hyperproliferative  signals,  thereby  preventing 
tumor  formation  [1].  Thus,  it  is  aptly  known  as 
“guardian  of  the  genome”.  Under  normal  physiolo-
gical  conditions,  p53  levels  are  tightly  regulated  by 
MDM2,  an  E3  ligase  that  triggers  p53  degradation 
through  the  ubiquitin  proteasome-dependent  path-
way.  p53  can  also  induce  MDM2  expression  by 
binding  to  its  promoter.  This  creates  a  negative 

loop 

to  promote  p53  degradation 

to 
feedback 
maintain  a  low  cellular  p53  [2].  In  the  presence  of 
cellular stresses, p53 undergoes a series of posttrans-
lational  modifications  such  as  1)  phosphorylation 
which stabilizes p53 by disrupting its interaction with 
MDM2,  2)  sequence-specific  DNA  binding,  3) 
transactivation  where  p53  activates  or  represses  its 
target genes involved in the control of cell cycle, DNA 
repair,  and  induction  of  senescence  and  apoptosis 
(Figure 1) [3]. 

In  this  article,  we  will  be  looking  into  the 
involvement of p53 and its mutations in the different 
processes associated with breast cancer development 
and review the various therapeutic strategies that are 
being  developed  to target  wild-type and  mutant  p53 
cancers.

cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and senescence.  

Functional effects of p53 

DNA repair: As a tumor suppressor, p53 plays a 
vital role in maintaining genome stability by allowing 
time for DNA repair machinery to eliminate damaged 
lesions  before  cell  proliferation  resumes  [4].  Several 
DNA  repair  pathways  regulated  by  p53  are  the 
nucleotide  excision  repair,  base  excision  repair, 
mismatch  repair,  and  DNA  double  stranded  break 
repair  pathways 
including  non-homologous  end 
joining and homologous recombination [5]. 

Cell  cycle  regulation:  Cell-cycle  checkpoints  are 
important  to  prevent  cells  from  progressing  to  the 
next phase of cell cycle before its prior phase has been 
accurately  completed.  In  the  presence  of  DNA 
damage,  p53  is  activated  to  regulate  the  G1-S  and 
G2-M  phase  restriction  points.  Upon  activation,  p53 
transcriptionally  regulates  p21,  14-3-3σ,  Cdc25c,  and 
GADD45  to  promote  cell  cycle  arrest  [6].  It  was 
reported that p53 induces G1 arrest primarily through 
p21  transactivation.  p21  inhibits  cyclin  E/CDK2 
function, thereby inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of 
retinoblastoma (Rb). Thus, Rb remains bound to E2F 
and the E2F-mediated transcription of cell cycle genes 
essential  for  G1  to  S  phase  progression  is  inhibited. 
p53  also  blocks  G2/M  by  inhibiting  cyclin  B1/cdc2 

functions through promoting 14-3-3σ expression upon 
DNA damage [7].  

Apoptosis:  Multiple  studies  have  reported  that 
p53 plays an important role in triggering apoptosis [8, 
9].  Both  major  signaling  pathways  that  propagate 
apoptosis: extrinsic pathways and intrinsic pathways 
are  mediated  by  p53  [10].  p53  triggers  the  extrinsic 
apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of the 
cell  death  receptors  Fas,  Death  Receptor  5,  and 
death-domain  containing  receptor  for  TRAIL.  This 
results 
in  the  formation  of  the  Death-inducing 
signaling  complex  to  trigger  a  cascade  of  caspase 
activation, including caspase-8 and caspase-3 [11]. p53 
also  triggers  the  intrinsic  apoptotic  pathway  by 
transactivating  Bcl2 
family  proapoptotic  genes, 
including  BAX,  Noxa,  PUMA,  and  BID.  The 
interaction  of  these  genes  promotes  multimerization 
and 
trigger 
cytochrome  c  release,  leading  to  the  activation  of 
caspase 9 [12].  

functional  activation  of  BAX 

to 

Senescence: Senescence is an irreversible cell cycle 
arrest  that  can  be  induced  by  different  types  of 
cellular stresses. Upon induction of senescence, p53 is 
activated  by  either  ATM/ATR  or  Chk1/2  protein  to 
transactivate p21,  thereby activating the  Rb  pathway 
[13].  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  p53  levels,

kinetics, and threshold of stressor intensity can dictate 
if  a  cell  decides  to  undergo  senescence  or  apoptosis 
[14]. 

Role of p53 in breast cancer 

TP53 status and prognosis in breast cancer 

Breast  cancer 

is  a  heterogeneous  disorder 
composed  of  several  biological  subtypes  that  have 
well-defined characteristics and responses to therapy 
[15].  TP53  is  the  most  frequently  mutated  gene  in 
breast  cancer,  constituting  approximately  30%  of  all 
breast cancer cases [16]. The majority of p53 mutations 
are located within the DNA binding domain and are 
caused  by  missense  point  mutations  that  inhibit  its 
transcriptional activity (Figure 2). These mutations are 
highly linked to tumor subtypes [17] (Figure 3A) and 
are  associated  with  poor  survival  in  breast  cancer 
patients (Figure 3B) [18].  

luminal-like 

(luminal-A  or 

Breast  cancers  are  mainly  divided  into  four 
molecular  subtypes  based  on  gene  expression 
patterns: 
luminal-B), 
basal-like,  normal-like,  and  HER-2  positive  [19].  The 
frequency  of  p53  mutation 
the 
luminal-like  subtype  (26%)  with  luminal-A  having  a 
lower  mutation  frequency  (17%)  than  luminal-B

frequency of p53 mutation (88%), while about half of 
HER2-amplified tumors (53%) harbor p53 mutations. 
The  presence  of  p53  mutation  and  HER2  overex-

prognosis compared to other subtypes [20].  

lowest 

in 

is 

It has also been shown that inflammatory breast 
cancer (50%) has a higher frequency of p53 mutations 
than non-inflammatory breast cancer (20-30%) [21]. A 
recent  paper  reported 
that  p53  mutations  are 
associated with shorter overall survival in metastatic 
breast  cancer  across  subtypes  [22].  The  frequency  of 
p53 mutations is also found to be higher in patients in 
advanced  stage  and  high-grade  tumors.  Moreover, 
these  mutations  have  been  associated  with  subtypes 
with  aggressive  behavior  such  as  triple  negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) or HER2-amplified BC [23].  

Role of mutant p53 in cancer development and 
progression 

Besides  exhibiting  a  dominant-negative  activity 
that  obstructs  wild-type  p53  functions,  mutations  in 
p53 
can  also  acquire  oncogenic  activity  by 
gain-of-function  (GOF)  mechanisms  in  which  the 
mutant  protein  interact  with  novel  transcription 
factors or cofactors to regulate gene transcription and 
expression  to  drive  cancer  development  (Figure  4) 
[24]. 

Genome  instability:  Genome  instability  is  an 
inherent hallmark of all types of human cancers. The 
GOF  activity  of  mutant  p53  has  been  shown  to 
promote genome instability. In breast cancer samples, 
mutant  p53 
is  associated  with  abnormal  copy 
numbers  [25].  The  p53  R172H  mutant  (R175H 
equivalent  in  mice)  shows  centrosome  abnormalities 
the 
cyclinE-cdk2 
by  modulating 
centrosome, leading to centrosome amplification [26]. 
Another study reported that mutant p53 can bind and 
increase the expression of chromatin-regulated genes, 
including methyltransferases MLL1 and MLL2 which 
enhance  histone  methylation  and  acetylation  and 
contributes 
instability  and  cancer 
progression [27].

at 

Evading  apoptosis:  Mutant  p53  evades  apoptosis 
by interacting with p53 family members, p63 and p73, 
to  suppress  their  tumor  suppressive  activities  [28]. 
Several p53 mutations, such as the R273H and R175H, 
were reported to inhibit apoptosis by suppressing the 
expression  of  BCL2-modifying  factor  via  enhanced 
AKT  signaling  [29]  and  reducing  p73  transcriptional 
activity on Bax promoter respectively [30]. 

Proliferation: Mutant p53 proteins can activate the 
transcription  of  several  genes  associated  with  cell 
proliferation  that  are  distinct  from  its  wild-type 
counterpart  [31].  Several  of  these  include  c-MYC, 
MAP2K3, CXCL1, and CCNE2. Moreover, mutant p53 
has been reported to interact with several proteins or 
that  drive  breast  cancer 
transcription

element-binding  protein  (SREBPs)  via  activation  of 
mevalonate pathway [32], PARP [33], NF-Y [34], and

Metastasis: Mutant p53 has also been reported to 
enhance  tumor  aggressiveness  and  metastatic  poten-
tial  via  several  mechanisms.  One  such  mechanism  is 
the  stabilization  of  mutant  p53  protein  by  Rab 
coupling  protein-mediated  secretion  of  Hsp90  which 
enhances  cell  invasion  and  metastasis  in  cancer  cells 
[36].  Mutant  p53  also  interacts  with  the  G-protein 
coupled 
receptor 
(ADORA2B)  [37],  and  Pin1  [38].  Both  interactions 
result  in  increased  invasion  and  metastasis  and  are 
associated  with  poor  clinical  outcomes  in  breast 
cancer.

P53 as a therapeutic target: a two-sided 
approach 

While TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in 
breast  cancer,  more  than  two-thirds  of  breast  cancer 
cases  retain  the  wild-type  status,  of  which  the 
majority belongs to the luminal-like subtype [16]. The 
p53 activity in these tumors is mainly suppressed by 
the overexpression of MDM2 or MDMX. For the other 
one-third  of  breast  cancer  cases,  p53  function  is 
inactivated  by  mutations,  of  which  majority  are 
observed in HER2+ and basal-like subtypes. As such, 
several  mutation  status-differentiated  therapeutic 

strategies have been explored to target these two main 
mechanisms of p53 inactivation in order to restore its 
tumor suppressive functions. 

Therapies against wild-type p53-bearing breast 
cancer  

expression 

A deregulated balance between p53 and MDM2 
can  lead  to  malignant  changes  in  normal  cells. 
Approximately 7% of all human tumors have MDM2 
[39].  This  gives  MDM2  an 
gene  amplification 
oncogene-like  property.  In  breast  cancer,  approxi-
mately  38%  of  patients  exhibit  increased  MDM2 
[40].  Furthermore,  MDM2 
protein 
expression is associated with the presence of estrogen 
receptors 
(ER)  with  higher  MDM2  expression 
observed in ER+ cell lines [41]. This makes MDM2 an 
attractive  target  for  therapies  especially  in  cancers 
with  wild-type  p53.  Majority  of  therapies  against 
MDM2  focus  on  either  1)  inhibiting  the  MDM2-p53 
interaction,  2)  downregulating  MDM2  expression, 
and  3)  inhibiting  its  E3  ligase  activity  and  its 
interaction  with  the  proteasome  to  reduce  p53 
degradation  and  activate  p53-dependent 
tumor 
suppressor pathways (Figure 5; Table 1).

chemical classes that claim to inhibit such interaction 
[43]. However, most studies focus on three classes of 
compounds: nutlins, spirooxindoles, and benzodiaze-
pinediones.  In  this  review,  we  will  focus  our 
discussions  on  nutlin-based  and  spirooxindole  class 
compounds given that they are the most widely used 
classes among the MDM2-p53 interaction inhibitors in 
breast cancer studies and display drug-like properties. 
Nutlins:  Nutlins  act  by  sterically  inhibiting 
MDM2  at  its  p53  binding  pocket.  This  in  turn 
stabilizes  p53  and  induces  p53-associated  cell  cycle 
arrest and apoptosis in MDM2-overexpressing cancer 
cells  [44].  Nutlin-1,  2,  3  are  the  first  of  such 
compounds  of  the  nutlin  family.  Over  time,  there 
have been multiple iterations of the nutlin compound 
including  RG7112  and  Idasanutlin  (RG7388)  with 
improved  binding,  potency,  and  pharmacological 
properties  [45].  While  these  compounds  showed 
dose-dependent stabilization of p53 and sensitivity in 
cells  with  wild-type  p53,  they  failed  to  induce  any 
p53-regulated  tumor  suppressive  effects  in  cells 
harboring mutant or non-functional p53 [46].

The  activity  of  nutlins 

limited  by  the 
overexpression  of  MDMX,  another  p53  negative 
regulator,  as  they  exclusively  bind  to  MDM2’s  p53 
binding  pocket  [47].  A  strategy  to  overcome  p53 
inactivation  by  MDMX  is  combining  nutlins  with 
doxorubicin,  an  anthracycline-based  DNA  damaging 
agent  that  triggers  direct  MDM2  ubiquitination  and 
subsequent  degradation  of  MDMX  [48].  Yet  another 
strategy  of  overcoming  MDMX  inactivation  is  by 
using  small  molecule  MDMX  inhibitors  such  as 
SJ-172550,  XI-011,  and  XI-006.  These  inhibitors  yield 
additive  effects  in  combination  with  nutlin-3a  and 
induce  apoptosis  in  the  ER+  MCF-7  cell  line  with 
wild-type p53 [49, 50].  

Several nutlin-based compounds have advanced 
into Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, however, most 
of these are evaluated in patients with hematological 
malignancies or sarcomas. To our knowledge, there is 
only  one  trial  recruiting  exclusively  breast  cancer 
patients  (NCT03566485).  This  study  investigated  the 
combination  of  idasanutlin  (100mg  oral)  and  anti- 
PD-L1  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  atezolizumab 
(840mg IV) in stage IV or unresectable recurrent ER+ 
breast cancer patients. The rationale behind this drug 
combination  stems  from  the  observation  that  MDM2 
is  associated  with  rapid  disease 
amplification 
progression 
receiving  PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors in various cancers [51]. Unfortunately, this 
study  has  been  terminated  due  to  low  accrual. 
Preliminary  results  showed  4  out  of  7  patients  with 
disease  progression  and  serious  adverse  events  in 
which  the  majority  are  associated  with  blood  or 
lymphatic  disorders,  suggesting  that  there  are  still 

in  patients 

major  hurdles  to  overcome  before  nutlin-based 
compounds  can  be  applied  in  the  clinic  for  breast 
cancer patients. 

Spirooxindoles:  Similar  structural  derivatives  of 
nutlins  are  the  spirooxindoles  (or  MI-series).  These 
mimic  the  MDM2-p53  hydrophobic  pocket  residues 
important for binding. Similar to nutlins, drugs from 
this  class  exhibit  specific  potency  in  cells  with 
wild-type  p53  while  minimally  affecting  those  with 
mutant p53. There are several of such small molecule 
compounds  evaluated 
in  breast  cancer  models, 
however,  all  are  in  the  pre-clinical  stages  [52-59]. 
These  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  All  of  these

cell lines or xenografts by triggering p53 downstream

Other small molecule MDM2-p53 inhibitors: Besides 
nutlins  and  spirooxindoles,  there  are  also  several 
small  molecule  MDM2-p53  inhibitors  that  have  been 
evaluated  in  breast  cancer  models.  However,  these 
have not been extensively studied as a class. One such 
example is RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of 
tumor cell apoptosis) which binds to the N-terminus 
of  p53  and  induces  a  conformational  change  that 
disrupts  the  MDM2-p53  interaction,  resulting  in  p53 
accumulation  [60].  RITA  has  also  been  reported  to 
induce MDMX degradation through ATM [61]. Other 
compounds  that  act  on  the  MDM2-p53  interaction 
tricetin,  and  NVP- 
include  prenylchalcone  2e, 
CGM097. These compounds lead to increased protein 
expression  of  p53  and  its  downstream  effectors, 
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis specifically in 
wild-type p53 bearing cells [62-64]. 

The  MDM2-p53  piperidinone-based  inhibitor, 
AMG  232  (or  KRT-232),  was  evaluated  in  a  Phase  I 
trial recruiting patients with wild-type p53 advanced 
cancers, including ER+ breast cancer (NCT01723020). 
These  patients  received  AMG  232  at  the  maximum 
tolerated  dose  of  240  mg  with  3  patients  exhibiting 
dose-limiting 
thrombocytopenia  or 
neutropenia.  AMG  232  treatment  increased  serum 
indicating  p53 
macrophage 
pathway  activation  and  on-target  activity,  in  a 
dose-dependent  manner.  Promising  efficacy  signals 
were observed with stable disease in 7 out of 12 ER+ 
breast cancer patients (58.3%) [65].

toxicities  of 

PROTACs:  The  concept  of  MDM2-p53  binding 
inhibition  has  extended  beyond  small  molecules.  An 
example is the use of these compounds for the design 
targeting  chimeras 
of  MDM2-based  proteolysis 
(PROTACs),  utilizing  MDM2’s  E3  ligase  activity  to 
degrade  a  specific  protein-of-interest.  There  are 
currently  3  PROTACs  which  incorporate  a  nutlin- 
based derivative to recruit MDM2 for the degradation

of androgen receptor, PARP1, and BRD4 respectively 
[66].  Besides  degradation  of  pro-oncogenic  proteins, 
these  compounds  have  a  dual  role  in  sequestering 
MDM2,  thereby  stabilizing  wild-type  p53  in  the 
process.  PROTACs  can  also  be  designed  to  target 
MDM2  for  degradation.  The  IMiD-based  PROTAC 
MD-224 utilizes lenalidomide and MI-1061 as ligands 
of  the  E3  ligase  cereblon  and  MDM2  respectively  to 
degrade  MDM2  protein  which  in  turn  decreases  p53 
degradation by MDM2 [67]. 

the  cell-impermeable  peptide 

Peptides:  Other  non-small  molecule  MDM2-p53 
inhibitors  include  angler  peptides  developed  by 
Phillippe  and  colleagues.  Angler  peptides  were 
synthesized  by  conjugating  cell-penetrating  peptides 
with 
inhibitor  of 
MDM2-p53/MDMX-p53, KD3. Two of such peptides, 
cTAT-KD3  and  cR10-KD3,  were  able  to  activate  the 
p53  pathway  via  endocytic  pathway  and  direct 
membrane  translocation  within  micromolar  concen-
trations  respectively  in  several  cancer  cell  lines 
including  MCF-7.  This 
that 
non-permeable peptides can be conjugated to a stable 
penetrating  peptide  to  allow  delivery  into  cytosol  to 
inhibit specific pathways such as MDM2/MDMX-p53 
pathway [68]. 

showed 

study 

Stapled  peptides  can  also  be  utilized  to  inhibit 
the MDM2-p53 interaction. The main selling point of 
stapled  peptides  is  that they  can inhibit  both  MDM2 
and  MDMX.  Examples  of  stapled  peptides  that  have 
been  evaluated  in  breast  cancer  models  include 
SAH-p53-8 which exhibited better response in MCF-7 
compared to Nutlin-3 [69] and ATSP-7041 which was 
reported  to  induce  a  prolonged  inhibitory  effect  of 
MDM2-p53  interaction  in  MCF-7  with  favorable 
pharmacokinetic  properties  [70].  ALRN-6924,  an 
analogue of ATSP-7041, was also evaluated in breast 
cancer  cell  lines  and  xenografts.  Unsurprisingly,  this 
peptide  was  selectively  active  in  wild-type  p53  and 
not  mutant  p53  cells  in  the  nanomolar  range. 
ALRN-6924  is  the  only  non-small  molecule  MDM2- 
p53 inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical trials 
involving  breast  cancer  patients  with  wild-type  p53 
(NCT03725436), however, no results have been posted 
thus far.  
Downregulating MDM2 expression  

The  inhibition  or  downregulation  of  MDM2  is 
another  therapeutic  strategy  against  tumors  with 
wild-type  p53.  While  this  strategy  yields  a  similar 
outcome  of  increased  p53  activity,  the  mechanism  of 
inhibition  of  MDM2-p53 
action  differs 
interaction such that it directly inhibits MDM2 [43].  

from 

Several  compounds  capable  of  direct  MDM2 
binding to induce its downregulation or degradation 
include JapA [71], Inulanolide A, and lineariifolianoid 

A. These compounds not only induce MDM2 protein 
degradation and represses its transcription, the latter 
two  also  inhibit  NFAT1,  an  MDM2  transactivator 
frequently  overexpressed  in  breast  cancer  [72,  73]. 
Another  example  is  SP-141  which  shows  direct 
MDM2  binding  and  inhibition  of  its  expression  by 
promoting  its  autoubiquitination  and  degradation 
[74]. These compounds induce cytotoxicity, apoptosis, 
and G2/M arrest, as well as inhibit tumor growth in 
xenograft  models  irrespective  of  p53  mutational 
status. Another MDM2 inhibitor CPI-7c was reported 
to  bind  to  the  RING  and  N-terminal  domains  of 
MDM2  to  induce  its  degradation  via  the  ubiquitin- 
proteasome pathway. This not only stabilizes p53 but 
promotes the binding of p53 to the promoters of death 
receptors,  DR4  and  DR5,  to  induce  TRAIL-induced 
apoptosis [75]. 

Beyond  novel  MDM2-targeting  compounds, 
several existing clinically approved drugs also exhibit 
secondary  activities  against  MDM2, 
such  as 
albendazole and fenbendazole, which upregulate p53 
and  its  downstream  effector,  p21,  by  significantly 
decreasing  the  expression  of  MDM2  and  MDMX  in 
melanoma  and  breast  cancer  cell  lines  [76].  The 
widely-used  selective  estrogen  receptor  degrader, 
fulvestrant,  was  also  reported  to  cause  a  decreased 
estrogen-dependent  MDM2 
and 
increased  MDM2  protein  turnover  rate  without 
altering MDM2 gene expression and p53 activity. The 
reduction of MDM2 by fulvestrant is independent of 
p53 mutational status [77]. This further strengthens its 
use as an effective treatment in advanced ER+ breast 
cancers where MDM2 is often overexpressed. 

upregulation 

Natural  compounds  also  exhibit  activities 
against  MDM2.  Natural  products  such  as  curcumin 
[78], genistein [79], ginsenosides (25-OCH3-PPD [80]), 
Platycodin  D  [81],  makaluvamine  analogues  (FBA- 
TPQ,  PEA-TPQ,  MPA-TPQ,  DPA-TPQ,  BA-TPQ)  [82, 
83], melatonin [84], gambogic acid [85], gossypol [86, 
87],  hispolon  [88],  and  oroxylin  A  [89]  have  all  been 
shown to downregulate MDM2 expression; however, 
their association with MDM2 were all only evaluated 
in the pre-clinical stages.  

While  direct  targeting  of  MDM2  is  a  viable 
therapeutic strategy against wild-type p53 tumors, the 
approaches  are  still  in  the  pre-clinical  stages.  It  is 
worth  highlighting  that  both  wild-type  and  mutant 
p53-carrying cells respond to MDM2 inhibition across 
the  studies  mentioned  in  this  review.  A  proposed 
mechanism of action is p21 upregulation independent 
of  p53.  As  such,  the  use  of  direct  MDM2  inhibitors 
may  provide  an  edge  over 
the 
MDM2-p53 interaction in mutant p53 tumors.

Inhibiting MDM2’s E3 ligase activity and its binding to 
proteasome  

to 

its  binding 

Another strategy to minimize the degradation of 
wild-type  p53  is  through  inhibition  of  E3  ligase 
activity  of  MDM2  or 
the  26S 
family  of  7-nitro-5-deazaflavin 
proteasome.  The 
compounds  (HLI98s,  HLI373,  and  HLI393)  promotes 
p53 stabilization by binding to MDM2’s RING finger 
domain  that  is  responsible  for  its  E3  ligase  activity 
without  depleting  its  expression.  This  results  in  the 
inhibition  of  MDM2-mediated  p53  degradation, 
restoring  p53  activities  to  selectively  kill  cancer  cells 
harboring  wild-type  p53  [90,  91].  Similarly,  the 
natural  compound  sempervirine  inhibits  MDM2  E3 
ligase  activity  resulting  in  apoptosis  of  cancer  cells 
[92].  Another  class  of  MDM2  E3  ligase  inhibitors  are 
the MEL compounds MEL23 & MEL24 which inhibit 
MDM2-MDMX  E3  ligase  activity  by  decreasing  the 
ubiquitination  of  the  RING  domains  of  MDM2- 
MDMX heterocomplex. While they induced cell death 
in  a  p53-dependent  manner 
in  cells  harboring 
wild-type p53, they also exhibited p53-independent/ 
MDM2-dependent 
cells, 
suggesting that these compounds can be used beyond 
wild-type p53-expressing cancers [93].  

in  p53-null 

activity 

The  tryptamine  derivative,  JNJ26854165,  funct-
ions to inhibit the binding of MDM2-p53 complex to 
proteasome,  thereby  inducing  p53-associated  apop-
tosis in cells with wild-type p53 [93]. This compound 
has  successfully  advanced  into  a  Phase  I  trial 
including seven patients with advanced breast cancer 
(NCT00676910). One patient showed partial response 
to  JNJ26854165,  and  tumor  biopsies  showed  102% 
increase  in  p53  levels  [94].  JNJ26854165  was  also 
reported  to  exhibit  other  anti-tumoral  activities 
beyond MDM2/p53 as it induced S-phase arrest and 
E2F1-mediated apoptosis in cells with p53 mutation(s) 
[95]. 

Therapies against mutant p53-bearing breast 
cancer 

found 

frequently 

Mutant  p53  drives  tumor  growth,  progression, 
and  metastasis,  and 
in 
is 
HER2-enriched and TNBC subtypes [96]. This makes 
it  an  attractive  therapeutic  target  for  breast  cancer. 
Mutation  of  p53  is  also  likely  clonal  in  TNBC  [97], 
providing  a  rare  feature  of  homogeneity 
in  a 
heterogenic cancer like breast cancer. The relative lack 
of  targeted  therapies  and  intrinsic  aggressiveness  of 
TNBC  tumors  further  underscore  the  therapeutic 
value to target mutant p53. 

Targeted  therapies  against  tumors  with  mutant 
p53  mainly  focus  on  1)  reactivation  or  restoration  of 
mutant p53 to wild-type p53 functions, 2) promoting 
lethality,  4) 
degradation,  3) 

inducing  synthetic 

inhibiting  its  gain-of-function-associated  interactors 
or  pathways,  5)  immunotherapies,  and  6)  gene 
therapies  with  vectors  to  incorporate  wild-type  p53 
gene into tumor cells (Figure 6; Table 2). 

Restoring mutant p53 to wild-type-like conformations 
or functions 

Majority of TP53 mutations are missense with a 
single  amino  acid  substitution  in  the  p53  protein, 
leading  to  a  loss  of  its  DNA  binding  ability  [98]. 
Various compounds such as quinuclidines, pyrazoles, 
2-sulfonylpyrimidines,  and  thiosemicarbazones  have 
been  developed  to  restore  mutant  p53  to  wild-type 
p53-like functions. 

Quinuclidines:  Quinuclidine-based  prodrugs, 
PRIMA-1  and  its  methylated  analogue,  APR-246  (or 
PRIMA-1MET),  are  metabolized in vivo  into  the  active 
metabolite,  2-methylene-3-quinuclidinone  (MQ).  MQ 
is  a  nucleophile  acceptor  that  modifies  thiol  groups 
via  Michael  addition  reaction,  correcting  the  folding 
of  mutant  p53  protein  by  targeting  exposed  cysteine 
residues  within  its  core  domain  to  restore  its  DNA 
binding  capability.  Known  targets  of  MQ  include 
Cys-124  and  Cys-277  which  are  key  residues  in 
stabilizing  mutant  p53  R175H  [99].  Besides  mutant 
p53 reactivation, PRIMA-1 also reverses its dominant 
negative  effect  by  preventing  the  aggregation  of 
mutant  p53  [100].  Additionally,  it  upregulates  p53 
downstream  genes  such  as  p21,  BAX,  PUMA,  and 
NOXA,  and  activates  caspase-2,  -3,  and  -9  to  induce 
apoptosis  in  several  cancers  including  breast  cancer 
[101].  

Both  PRIMA-1  and  APR-246  were  reported  to 
preferentially  inhibit  mutant  p53  over  wild-type  p53 
breast  cancer  cell  lines  and  mice  xenografts  [100]. 
Interestingly,  high  endogenous  p53  expression  also 
correlates  with  increased  sensitivity  to  APR-246  in  a 
range of breast cancer cell lines [102].  

Currently,  PRIMA-1  and  its  analogue  are  a 
subject  of  future  studies  as  not  all  targeted  cysteine 
residues within the core domain have been identified 
and  their  mechanisms  of  reactivating  mutant  p53 
remain unclear. Furthermore, the modification of thiol 
groups by MQ are not specific. MQ can also react with 
thioredoxin  reductase  1  and  deplete  glutathione, 
generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce 
cytotoxicity independent of p53 mutation [103]. 

2-sulfonylpyrimidines:  The  2-sulfonypyrimidine 
compound,  PK11007,  also  exhibits  mutant  p53 
restoration  properties  via  selective  alkylation  of 
cysteine residues, which increases thermal stability of 
DNA  binding  domain  of  mutant  p53  Y220C  and 
V143A 
to 
preferentially  induce  apoptosis  and  exhibit  growth 
inhibitory  effects  in  mutant  p53  over  wild-type  p53 

[104].  PK11007  was  also 

reported

carrying  breast  cancer  cells  at  a  significantly  lower 
concentration.  RNA  sequencing  and  gene  ontology 
data revealed that PK11007 increased gene expression 
in  pathways  associated  with  apoptosis,  signal 
transduction,  protein  refolding,  and 
locomotion, 
induced by p53 reactivation [105].  

the 

Thiosemicarbazones:  Another  class  of  compounds 
that  reactivates  mutant  p53  are 
thiosemi-
carbazones.  Zinc  ion  is  an  essential  cofactor  of 
wild-type  p53  to  facilitate  p53  binding  to  DNA. 
Mutations  in  any  of  the  zinc-coordinating  residues 
abolish  p53  binding  to  zinc,  resulting  its  inability  to 
bind  to  DNA  [106].  Thiosemicarbazones  act  as  zinc 
chelators,  promoting  zinc  binding  to  mutant  p53. 
COTI-2 is one such compound of this class. It has been 

shown  to  restore  DNA  binding  capacity  of  mutant 
p53,  thereby  inducing  activation  of  p53  target  genes 
including  p21,  PUMA,  and  NOXA.  In  vitro  data 
revealed that breast cancer cell lines harboring mutant 
p53  exhibit  significantly  lower  IC50  than  those  with 
wild-type  p53  [107].  COTI-2  was  reported  to  be  safe 
and  well-tolerated 
in  various  mice  xenografts, 
including  MDA-MB-231  mutant  p53  model.  Other 
thiosemicarbazone-derived 
including 
NSC319725,  NSC319726,  NSC328784.  NSC319726  (or 
ZMC1)  preferentially  inhibited  p53  mutant  cell  lines 
over  wild-type  cells,  specifically  those  with  the  R175 
mutation 
[108].  Like  APR-246  and  PK11007, 
NSC319726  was  reported  to  decrease  glutathione 
levels which in turn increases ROS.

Natural  p53  reactivators:  There  are  several 
naturally occurring compounds that show mutant p53 
restoration  activities.  These  include  KSS-9  [109], 
R-goniothalamin  (GON)  [110],  Phenethyl  Isothio-
cyanate (PEITC) [111], HO-3867 [112], chetomin [113], 
and  2-[(4-hydroxybenzyl)  amino]  phenol  (HBAP) 
[114].  These  compounds  are  capable  of  restoring  the 
transcriptional activity of p53 and exhibit preferential 
activities  towards  mutant  p53  over  wild-type  p53 
harboring cell lines in various models of breast cancer 
under in vitro and/or in vivo conditions.  

Several  of  these  small  molecule  reactivators  of 
mutant  p53  have  advanced  to  Phase  I  and  II  trials, 
including  APR-246,  COTI-2  and  PC14586.  However, 
only  PC14586  has  been  validated  in  breast  cancer 
patients. The oral, small molecule inhibitor, PC14586, 
was  administered  in  patients  with  advanced  solid 

tumors  with  p53  Y220C  mutation,  including  several 
breast  cancer  patients,  as  part  of  PMV  Pharma-
ceuticals' Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT04585750). This 
compound is designed to specifically target Y220C by 
increasing  its  thermal  stability,  thus  restoring  p53 
DNA  binding  abilities.  Preclinical  results  showed  a 
restoration  of  p53 
transcriptional  activity  and 
increased expression of p21, MDM2, Bax, and PUMA, 
and  oral  administration  of  PC14586  at  100mg/kg  in 
nude  mice  bearing  Y220C  gastric  cancer  xenografts 
resulted in 80% tumor regression after 3-weeks [115]. 
Initial  Phase  I  data  concluded  that  the  compound  is 
generally safe and well-tolerated up to 3000 mg daily 
with  one  of  the  breast  cancer  patients  achieving 
partial  response  [116],  showing  promise  of  this 
therapeutic strategy.

Inducing mutant p53 degradation  

Hsp90 

inhibitors:  Unlike  normal  cells, 

the 
stabilization of mutant p53 proteins in cancer cells are 
aided  by  chaperones  such  as  heat  shock  protein  90 
(Hsp90)  [117].  Thus,  targeting  Hsp90  may  be  a 
tumors.  The  first 
strategy  against  mutant  p53 
developed inhibitors of Hsp90, geldanamycin and its 
analogue  17-AAG,  were  reported  to  destabilize  p53 
V143A,  R175H,  S241F,  R273C/H,  and  R280K 
mutations,  thereby  triggering  its  degradation  by  E3 
ligases  MDM2  or  CHIP  [118].  Ganetespib  was  later 
synthesized  with  much  improved  potency  and  was 
reported to induce mutant p53 degradation in breast 
cancer  mice  models  encompassing  several  p53 
mutations [119].  
HDAC 

histone 
deacetylase  (HDAC),  besides  their  role  in  epigenetic 
to  exhibit  secondary 
regulation,  were  reported 
activities  against  mutant  p53  via  transcriptional  and 
post-transcriptional  mechanisms.  Vorinostat  (SAHA) 
and NaB are examples of Class I HDAC inhibitors that 
block  the  transcription  of  mutant  p53  by  abolishing 
the  activity  of  HDAC8  and  Yin  Yang-1  complex  in 
TNBC  [120].  Additionally,  vorinostat  induces  p53 
degradation by reducing its stability via inhibition of 
HDAC6, a key regulator of Hsp90 [119]. Other HDAC 
inhibitors  such  as  Trichostatin  A,  sodium  butyrate, 
and FR901228 were reported to reduce protein levels 
of  p53  R175H,  P223L,  V274F,  and  R249S,  and  R280K 
mutants [121].

While  Hsp90  and  HDAC  inhibitors  have  been 
evaluated  in  various  clinical  trials  involving  breast 
cancer patients, their association with p53 mutational 
status has not been fully investigated. 

Other  inducers  of  mutant  p53  degradation:  Besides 
Hsp90  and  HDAC  inhibitors,  there  are  other  natural 
or  synthetic  compounds  that  show  mutant  p53 
degradation activities in various breast cancer models. 
These  include  arsenic  trioxide  [122],  gambogic  acid 
[123],  Spautin-1  [124],  YK-3-237  [125],  triptolide, 
Origanum  majorana  extract  (OSE)  [126,  127],  THZ1

[132].  However, 

for  most  of 

There  are  also  other  means  of  inducing  mutant 
p53  degradation  beyond  the  use  of  small  molecule 
compounds.  For  example,  zeolitic 
imidazolate 
framework-8  (ZIF-8),  composed  of  zinc  ions  as  the 
metal node and 2-methylimidazolate as its linker, was 
reported  to  increase  mutant  p53  gluthionylation  to 
facilitate  polyubiquitination  and 
its  subsequent 
degradation. ZIF-8 was later improved using Z1-RGD 
to  exhibit  higher  stability  and  better

internalization,  as  well  as  mutant  p53  degradation 
ability.  This modified  ZIF-8  demonstrated  promising 
therapeutic  efficacy  in  breast  cancer  patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) carrying p53 mutation [133]. Another 
means  of  degradation  is  through  dietary  glucose 
restriction.  Mutant  p53  drives  the  Warburg  effect  by 
promoting  the  translocation  of  glucose  transporter 
GLUT1 to the cell surface to increase glucose uptake.

Synthetic lethality 

The  G1/S  checkpoint  is  an  important  cell  cycle 
regulator to ensure  proper  DNA  replication  [135].  In 
the  presence  of  DNA  damage,  wild-type  p53  will 
induce  G1/S  arrest  to  repair  DNA  before  S  phase 
entry  [5].  Cancer  cells  harboring  mutant  p53  can 
bypass this checkpoint even with DNA damage. Thus, 
they rely entirely on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain 
genomic  stability  [136].  An  inactivation  of  G2/M 
checkpoint  will  result  in  unscheduled  entry  into 
mitosis  even  with  extensive  DNA  damage,  causing 
mitotic  catastrophe.  This  can  be  a  potential 
therapeutic target for mutant p53 tumors.  

Targeting the G2 checkpoint:  Wee1  kinase  plays  a 
critical role in G2/M checkpoint control by mediating 
cell  cycle  arrest  through  inhibiting  CDK1  activity. 
Wee1  is  upregulated  in  various  cancers  including 
breast cancer [137]. The Wee1 inhibitor, MK-1775 (or 
AZD1775  or  Adavosertib),  promotes  cancer  cells  to 
bypass  G2/M  checkpoint, 
to  mitotic 
catastrophe.  This  compound  showed  amplified 
anti-tumor activity in cells harboring mutant p53 over 
wild-type p53 in various cancer models, however, this 
difference  is  not  as  notable  amongst  ER+  cell  lines 
[138, 139]. 

leading 

Another  compound  that  exploits  mutant  p53’s 
reliance  on  G2/M  is  UCN-01,  a  Chk1  (upstream  of 
Wee1).  While  this  compound  showed  preferential 
cytotoxic effect in mutant p53-overexpressing cells to 
wild-type p53, it yielded less than satisfactory results 
in  Phase  I  clinical  trials  [140].  A  more  selective 
inhibitor  of  Chk1,  AZD7762,  revived  Chk1  as  a 
therapeutic  target  against  mutant  p53  as  it  exhibited 
enhanced  response  and  increased  survival  in  TNBC 
mice  models 
[141]. 
Additionally,  AZD7762  promotes  radiation-induced 
apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe in mutant p53 T47D 
impeding  tumor  xenograft 
breast  model,  while 
growth by abrogating radiation-induced G2/M arrest 
and DNA double-strand repair [142].  

bearing  p53  mutation 

The  G2  checkpoint  vulnerability  of  mutant  p53 
also  forms  the  basis  of  several  combination  therapy

designs in  breast  cancer. For  example,  the  sequential 
treatment  of  a  pan-CDK  inhibitor,  roscovitine  before 
doxorubicin  was  shown  to  induce  synthetic  lethality 
specifically  in  mutant  p53  TNBC  cells.  Roscovitine 
arrests these cells in G2/M phase, and in combination 
increases  DNA  double-strand 
with  doxorubicin, 
breaks  and 
inhibits  DNA  repair  by  decreasing 
homologous  recombination-associated  proteins.  The 
sequential  treatment  of  roscovitine  and  doxorubicin 
shows  superior  reduction  in  tumor  volume  and 
improved  overall  survival  in  mutant  p53  TNBC 
xenografts over single-agent or concomitant treatment 
[143].  Another 
using 
combination 
deoxyuridine  analogues  and  PARP  inhibitors  also 
enhances  DNA  damage.  However,  unlike  wild-type 
p53 cells, cells with mutant p53 are unable to activate 
the  p53-p21  signaling  pathway  to  arrest  at  G1  for 
DNA repair. As a result, these cells are arrested at G2 
with accumulation of DNA damage. This combination 
is  unsurprisingly  synergistic  only  in  mutant  p53 
breast  cancer  and  significantly  inhibits  growth  and 
improves  overall  survival  in  mutant  p53  TNBC 
xenografts [144].

Other targets of synthetic lethality:  The  concept  of 
synthetic  lethality  in  mutant  p53  extends  beyond  G2

dependence.  Computational 
profiling  revealed  multiple  candidate  gene  targets 
involved  in  synthetic  lethality  with  mutant  p53. 
Among  these  candidate  genes  are  PLK1,  PLK4,  and 
AURKA  of  which  inhibitors  are  available  [145].

Onvansertib  showed  a  more  profound  effect  in 
mutant  p53-prevalent  TNBC  compared  to  wild-type

is  also  selectively 
combination  with  paclitaxel 
synergistic in mutant p53 breast cancer cell lines and 
xenograft  [146].  Another  synthetic  lethal  target  is 
phosphatidylinositol  5-phosphate  4-kinase  (PI5P4K). 
PI5P4K  was  reported  to  be  amplified  in  a  subset  of 
breast cancers and is associated with p53 mutations or 
deletions.  Depletion  of  this  kinase  in  p53-deficient 
breast  cancer  cells  resulted  in  growth  inhibition  in 
vitro  and  prolonged  lifespan  of  p53-knockout  mice 
[147]. So far, THZ-P1-2 is the only available inhibitor 
of PI5P4K, however, it has not been studied in breast 
cancer.  Besides  the  mentioned  targets,  there  may  be 
other  synthetic  lethal  targets  associated  with  mutant 
p53  remain  to  be  discovered.  These  discoveries  may 
provide more therapeutic options against tumors with 
mutant p53. 

Inhibiting mutant p53 gain-of-function interactors or 
pathways 

With  the  knowledge  of  mutant  p53  interactors, 
another therapeutic strategy is to design inhibitors of 

pathways  or  interactions  associated  with  the  GOF 
activities of mutant p53.  

Mutant p53-Nrf2:  The  mutant  p53-Nrf2  complex 
drives  the  transcriptional  activation  of  proteasome 
subunit genes, thereby increasing protein turnover in 
breast  cancer  models  [148].  The  use  of  proteasome 
inhibitor  carfilozomib  in  combination  with  APR-246 
was  reported  to  reduce  primary  tumor  growth  and 
dissemination  in  mutant  p53-bearing  breast  cancer 
xenografts [149].

Mutant  p53-SREBPs:  The  SREBP-mutant  p53 
complex  activates  SREBP  target  genes,  leading  to 
increased  sterol  production  via  the  mevalonate 
transcription 
pathway 
cofactors to promote cell proliferation [32]. The use of 
cholesterol-lowering  drugs  such  as  statins  was 
reported  to  induce  cytoplasmic  relocalization  of 
YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells harboring mutant p53 
[150].  Additionally,  they  were  reported  to  degrade 
mutant  p53  and 
its  GOF  activities.

TNBC patients, however, no results have been posted 
thus far.

synthase 

Mutant  p53-Pin1:  Another  protein  involved  in 
mutant  p53’s  GOF  activity  in  breast  cancer  is  Pin1. 
The structural changes of mutant p53 induced by Pin1 
shape  its  interactome  and  transcriptome.  Pin1  also 
interacts  with  mutant  p53  to  increase  expression  of 
genes  such  as  DEPDC1  to  drive  migration  and 
invasion  of  breast  cancer  cells  [38].  Pin1  inhibitors 
such  as  all-trans  retinoic  acid  (ATRA)  and  KPT-6566 
showed  a  dampening  of  Pin1-dependent  oncogenic 
phenotypes  and  growth  in  vivo,  as  well  as  curbed 
self-renewal  capabilities  of  breast  cancer  stem  cells. 
The sensitivity of breast cancer cells to KPT-6566 also 
correlates with Pin1 expression [152].

talazoparib-temolozomide  combination  [154].  These

in 
induce  AKT 
hormone-independent breast cancer cells [35]. The use 
of  peptide  aptamers  such  as  the  chimeric  decoy 
protein  (GFP-KA2)  to  target  the  mutant  p53-DAB2IP 
complex  has  been  shown  to  significantly  reduce 
inflammation-driven  and  insulin-driven  invasion  in 
vitro  and  xenograft  growth  and  spread  in  breast 
cancer models in vivo [155]. 

activation 

Mutant p53-COMPASS: Mutant p53 drives global 
epigenetic alterations in breast cancer. The interaction 
between mutant p53 and the transcription factor ETS2 
increases  the  expression  of  chromatin-regulatory 
COMPASS  (complex  proteins  associated  with  Set1) 
complex  subunits,  MLL1,  MLL2,  and  MOZ,  which 
possess  histone  methyl-  and  acetyltransferase 
activities  respectively.  Such  histone  modifications  in 
turn drive proliferation. Knockdown of MLL1 impairs 
colony formation and reduces tumor formation ability 
in  GOF  mutant  p53  cells  with  minimal  effect  in 
wild-type  p53  cells  [27].  The  use  of  COMPASS 
inhibitors  was  reported  to  reduce  cell  growth 
associated with mutant p53 in vitro, however, its effect 
in breast cancer models have not been elucidated. 

Overall,  while  these 

inhibitors  show  some 
degree of selectivity against mutant p53 models, this 
is an indirect approach of targeting mutant p53. Given 
the vast extent of mutant p53 interactors (which may 
be  mutation-specific)  and  their  varying  expressions 
between  patients,  targeting  multiple  interactors  may 
be required to yield a substantial clinical efficacy. 

Genetic approaches  

The  introduction  of  viral  or  plasmid  vectors  to 
incorporate  wild-type  p53  gene  can  be  directed 
towards tumor cells to trigger senescence or cell death 
[156]. One of the most notable constructs is Gendicine 
(or  Ad-p53)  which  combines  adenovirus  serotype-5 
vector with human wild-type p53 gene. Gendicine in 
combination  with  the  EGFR 
inhibitor,  gefitinib, 
showed  synergistic  growth  inhibition  in  vitro,  along 
with  decreased  tumor  burden  of  MDA-MB-468 
xenograft  [157].  Gendicine  has  been  evaluated  as 
treatment for TNBC in a clinical trial, in which half of 
the  patients  were 
in 
combination with capecitabine, and another half with 

treated  with  Gendicine 

than 

capecitabine alone. Gendicine + capecitabine induced 
that  of 
higher  response  rates  of  84.4% 
capecitabine alone (71.8%), suggesting that Gendicine 
has  clinical  potential  as  treatment  against  mutant 
p53-prevalent  TNBC  [158].  Other  similar  viral-based 
constructs are Advexin (or Ad5CMV-p53) and ONYX- 
015, both of which have also been evaluated in clinical 
trials.  The  intratumoral  injection  of  Ad5CMV-p53 
combined with docetaxel and doxorubicin in a Phase 
II  trial  was  terminated  early  as  none  of  the  locally 
advanced breast cancer patients achieved a pathologic 
complete  response.  Despite  that,  all  12  patients 
achieved an objective clinical response with extensive 
tumor-infiltrating  leukocytes  in  scattered  tumor  cells 
[159].  A  Phase  I  trial  evaluated  ONYX-015 
in 
combination  with  anti-TNF-α  receptor  etanercept  in 
patients  with  solid  tumors,  which  includes  2  breast 
cancer patients. Four out of 9 patients showed stable 
disease with mild side effects [160].  

Over  the  years,  gene  therapy  has  advanced  to 
multigene-based  combination  such  as  the  combina-
tion of p53 and inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), another 
tumor  suppressor  that  enhances  p53  acetylation  and 
its  transcriptional  activity.  A  multiple  promoter 
expression  cassette-based  recombinant  adenovirus 
co-expressing  ING4  and  p53  (AdVING4/p53)  was 
evaluated in mutant p53 TNBC cell line and xenograft 
and  showed  growth  inhibition  and  apoptosis  via 
enhanced acetylated p53 activity and its downstream 
effectors [161]. 

Besides viral vectors, plasmid vectors can also be 
delivered into cancer cells using nanoparticles in p53 
gene  therapies.  One  example  is  the  transferrin- 
SiNPs-p53, a transferrin-modified nanoparticle carry-
the  wild-type  p53  plasmid  construct.  The 
ing 
treatment  of  MCF-7  with 
transferrin-SiNPs-p53 
increases  wild-type  p53  expression  and  induces 
growth  inhibition  and  apoptosis  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
is  SGT-53,  a  non-viral 
[162].  Another  example 
nanocomplex composed of a cationic liposome coated 
with  an  anti-transferrin 
single-chain 
antibody  fragment,  which  can  selectively  deliver 
wild-type  p53  cDNA  into  tumor  cells  based  on  the 
higher  transferrin  receptor  on  tumors  absent  in 
normal  cells.  This  nanocomplex  showed  significant 
anti-tumor activity in several preclinical models [163, 
164]  and  was  reported  to  be  well-tolerated  and 
exhibited  anti-tumor  effects  in  several  clinical  trials 
involving  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumors  [165, 
166].

While  genetic 

approaches  using  vectors 
containing  wild-type  p53  show  promising  results, 
they  are  limited  to  p53-deficient  tumors  that  do  not

mutant  p53  [167].  That  is  until  the  discovery  of  a

chimeric  superactive  p53  (p53-CC).  The  p53-CC 
possesses an alternative oligomerization domain that 
bypasses the dominant negative effect of mutant p53 
by  forming  homo-oligomers  with  each  other.  Its 
delivery was achieved using adenovirus (Ad-p53-CC) 
and  was  shown  to  induce  superior  cell  death  over 
wild-type  p53  construct  in  a  dominant  negative  p53 
breast  cancer  model,  MDA-MB-468.  Additionally, 
tumor regression of MDA-MB-468 was observed after 
Ad-p53-CC  administration,  compared to  Ad-p53-WT 
which only halted tumor growth [168]. This presents 
an  alternative  strategy  to  overcome  the  dominant 
negative effect of mutant p53.  

editing  using  CRISPR-Cas9 

Other  modes  of  correcting  p53  mutation  in 
cancer  cells  are  by  synthetic  small  interfering  RNA 
(siRNA)  and  CRISPR-Cas9.  A  study  has  shown  that 
the  use  of  specific  siRNA  to  different  p53  hotspot 
mutations  decreased  cancer  cell  viability  with  no 
effect  on  wild-type  p53  mRNA  [169].  Furthermore, 
base 
successfully 
corrected p53 mutation in HCC1954 breast cancer cell 
line  at  a  3.3-7.6%  rate  [170].  While  optimization  to 
improve  the  delivery  and  editing  efficiency  of  these 
systems is warranted before clinical application, their 
use  to  target  tumors  harboring  mutant  p53  may 
the 
become  potential 
foreseeable future.

While mutant p53 can evade degradation by E3 
ligases, it can still be degraded in MDM2-independent 
and  proteasome-dependent  pathways.  Its  peptides

Another

against 
mutant p53 is through vaccination of cancer patients

strategy 

protein  as  a  target  for  the  host  immune  system  to 
mount  a  p53-specific  cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte  res-
ponse  against  mutant  p53.  Based  on  several  Phase  I 
trials,  p53MVA  vaccine  is  well-tolerated  with  no 
severe adverse events. Furthermore, it induces robust 
CD8+  T-cell  p53  response  in  peripheral  blood  [172]. 
The  combination  of  the  p53MVA  vaccine  with 
anti-PD-1  pembrolizumab  in  patients  with  advanced 
solid  tumors  including  breast  cancer  resulted  in 
disease control in 3/11 patients with 2 showing higher 
and more durable p53-reactive CD8+ T cells. [173]. In 
a  separate  case  study  of  a  TNBC  patient,  this 
combination  resulted 
in  complete  regression  of 
metastasis, accompanied by activation of p53-specific 
T  cell  responses  and  immune  response  genes  in 
peripheral blood [174]. This suggests that vaccination 
against  mutant  p53  can  be  a  viable  option  in  breast 
cancer. 

to  enhance 

Vaccines  can  also  be  administered  with  a  viral 
vector  against  mutant  p53.  An  example  is  the  Phase 
I/II study conducted using Gendicine and Indoximod 
in metastatic solid tumors and invasive breast cancer 
patients  (NCT01042535).  Gendicine  was  used  to 
generate dendritic cell (DC) vaccine against p53 while 
Indoximod  was  used 
immunologic 
responses  to  DC  vaccines.  Immunologic  responses 
were  observed  in  30.4%  of  evaluable  patients  and 
stable  disease  was  observed  in  4  out  of  39  patients. 
40.9%  of  patients  also  benefitted  from  chemotherapy 
after  vaccination  [175].  In  a  similar  trial,  the  use  of 
autologous DC-adenovirus p53 vaccine was evaluated 
in  Stage  III  breast  cancer  patients  (NCT00082641). 
Patients  received  a  total  of  4  vaccinations  and  were 
stratified  into  two  arms;  Arm  I  received  vaccination 
once  after two  different  chemotherapy  regimens  and 
twice  after  radiotherapy  &  Arm  II  received  4 
vaccinations after radiotherapy on separate weeks. All 
patients  exhibited  an 
immune  response  to  the 
Gendicine  DC  vaccine  in  Arm  I  compared  to  53%  in 
Arm  II.  However,  45.5%  of  patients  in  Arm  I 
developed serious toxicities compared to 8.3% in Arm 
II.  These  studies  suggest  that  the  use  of  Gendicine- 
based  DC  vaccines  can  be  used  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy to yield immunologic response against 
p53. 

Recent data reveal associations between p53 and 
immunological  checkpoints  in  cancer,  and  the  status 
of  p53  may  dictate  response  to  immune  checkpoint 
inhibitors  (ICIs)  [176].  It  was  reported  that  patients 
whose tumors harbored p53 missense mutations had 
increased  tumor  PD-L1  expressions  as  compared  to 
those with wild-type and had a better response rate to 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 [177]. ICIs also have the potential to 
reverse  endocrine  therapy  resistance  in  luminal  B

signatures  and 

expressions [178]. Despite this, the efficacy of ICIs as a 
monotherapy  in  breast  cancer,  especially  in  mutant 
p53-prevalent subtype like TNBC, is low. Thus, there 
is  a  need  to  develop  new  strategies  to  improve  the 
clinical benefits of ICIs [179]. Studies have shown that 
the  use  of  p53  gene  therapies  resulted  in  increased 
tumor 
interferon 
signaling, along with increased CD8+ T cell signature 
that is associated with better clinical responses to ICIs 
[180, 181]. Thus, ICIs have become a subject of several 
combinatorial  regimens  with  various  p53-specific 
targeted  therapies.  Examples  include  p53MVA  [182], 
SGT-53  [183],  Ad-p53  [184],  Ad-p53 + CD122/132 
[181],  OBP-702 (a  wild-type  p53 expressing  oncolytic 
adenovirus), 
mRNA 
nanoparticles  [185],  and  APR-246  with  anti-PD-1  in 
several  cancer  models.  While  most  of 
these 
combinations  have  not  been  evaluated  in  breast 
cancers, the consensus from these studies is that these 
various combinations resulted in 1) increased immune 
response such as cytotoxic T cell activities and CD8+ T 
cell infiltration, 2) a reduction in immunosuppressive 
cells 
expression  of 
immunosuppressive  regulators,  and  3)  have  the 
potential  to  reverse  resistance  to  ICIs.  In  July  2022, 
PMV  Pharmaceuticals  announced  a  clinical  trial  in 
collaboration with Merck evaluating the combination 
of  PC14586  and  pembrolizumab  in  advanced  solid 
cancer patients harboring p53 Y220C mutation.

Challenges in developing therapeutic 
strategies against p53 and future perspectives 
As  a  target,  p53  is  a  challenging  protein  to 
develop  inhibitors  against.  This  is  attributed  to  it 
being a transcription factor that lacks accessibility of a 
receptor-ligand  interaction  or  enzyme  active  site. 
Nonetheless, the  understanding  of  p53  structure  and 
its  interaction  partners  has  facilitated  the  discovery 
and  development  of  many  compounds  that  have the 
potential to restore the tumor suppressive activities of 
p53.  

Many  small  molecule  compounds  with  varying 
complexities  have  been  designed  to  target  both 
wild-type  and  mutant  p53-bearing  tumors,  although 
most  are  still  in  pre-clinical  stages  of  development 
[186].  Only  a  handful  of  candidate  drugs  have  been 
investigated  in  early  phase  clinical  trials  involving 
breast cancer cases (Table 3) and the results have been 
mixed  with  modest  efficacy  signals  and  high-grade 
toxicities,  in  contrast  to  their  promising  pre-clinical 
results.  While  the  exact  reasons  for  the  difference  in 
patient  response  to  the  small  molecule  inhibitors 
remains  unknown,  the  unintended  consequences  of 
inhibiting a certain target associated with p53 should 
be factored into consideration. For example, in tumors 
with  functional  p53,  the  inhibition  or  knockout  of 
MDM2  can  trigger  the  activation  of  other  oncogenic 
pathways  [187].  Additionally,  targeting  negative 
regulators  of  p53  may  lead  to  widespread  p53 
activation that may affect healthy cells alike.

In  the  case  of  targeting  mutant  p53,  the  use  of 
small  molecule  compounds  for  p53  reactivation  is 
limited  by  the  diverse  set  of  mutations  exhibiting 
varying structural alterations and molecular functions 
as  none  of  the  mentioned  compounds  in  this  review 
can target all  p53  mutations.  Furthermore,  several  of 
these strategies do not exclusively inhibit mutant p53 
and may contribute to adverse events.  

Another  area  of  concern  is  intratumoral  hetero-
geneity.  Given  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  breast 
tumors, the main question to be addressed is whether 
prolonged  use  of  these  compounds  can  exert  a 
selection pressure of pre-existing resistant cells or give 
rise  to  de  novo  mutations  that  can  limit  their  clinical 
benefits.  

therapeutic  agents 

As  most  of  the  evaluated  compounds  have 
shown  limited  clinical  efficacy  as  monotherapies, 
is 
combination  with  other 
warranted.  Moreover,  there  are  several  notable 
compounds  that  have  other  primary  mechanisms  of 
anti-cancer activities and have been evaluated in trials 
involving  breast  cancer  patients,  such  as  fulvestrant 
and several Hsp90 and HDAC inhibitors. While they 
exhibit  secondary  effects  against  either  wild-type  or 
mutant  p53  models,  their  association  with  p53 
mutational status has not been determined in patients. 
It  may  be  of therapeutic  value  if  future  clinical  trials 
are  conducted  taking  into  consideration  the  tumor’s

Conclusion  

The tumor suppressor p53 is a vital regulator of 
cellular  responses.  Both  wild-type  and  mutant  p53 
protein  are attractive therapeutic targets  due to their 
distinct subtype-based prevalence in breast cancers. In 
this  review,  we  have  summarized  the  different 
therapeutic  strategies  that  are  being  developed  to 
target  wild-type  and  mutant  p53-bearing  cells  in 
breast cancer models. These strategies share a similar 
intended  goal  of  minimizing  the  degradation  of 
wild-type  p53  and/or  decreasing  mutant  p53  levels 
via chemical or genetic approaches.
