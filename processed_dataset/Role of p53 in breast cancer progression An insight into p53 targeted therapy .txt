Received: 2022.12.14; Accepted: 2023.01.26; Published: 2023.02.27 The transcription factor p53 is an important regulator of a multitude of cellular processes. In the presence of genotoxic stress, p53 is activated to facilitate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In breast cancer, the tumor suppressive activities of p53 are frequently inactivated by either the overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2, or mutation which is present in 30-35% of all breast cancer cases. Notably, the frequency of p53 mutation is highly subtype dependent in breast cancers, with majority of hormone receptor-positive or luminal subtypes retaining the wild-type p53 status while hormone receptor-negative patients predominantly carry p53 mutations with gain-of-function oncogenic activities that contribute to poorer prognosis. Thus, a two-pronged strategy of targeting wild-type and mutant p53 in different subtypes of breast cancer can have clinical relevance. The development of p53-based therapies has rapidly progressed in recent years, and include unique small molecule chemical inhibitors, stapled peptides, PROTACs, as well as several genetic-based approaches using vectors and engineered antibodies. In this review, we highlight the therapeutic strategies that are in pre-clinical and clinical development to overcome p53 inactivation in both wild-type and mutant p53-bearing breast tumors, and discuss their efficacies and limitations in pre-clinical and clinical settings. Key words: Breast cancer, wild-type p53, mutant p53, targeted therapy, MDM2 Physiological functions of p53 in cancer Introduction to p53 The tumor suppressor p53 is a major transcription factor involved in the regulation of several cellular functions. In cancer, p53 attenuates cell proliferation in response to various stimuli, including DNA damage, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, hyperproliferative signals, thereby preventing tumor formation . Thus, it is aptly known as “guardian of the genome”. Under normal physiological conditions, p53 levels are tightly regulated by MDM2, an E3 ligase that triggers p53 degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent pathway. p53 can also induce MDM2 expression by binding to its promoter. This creates a negative loop to promote p53 degradation to feedback maintain a low cellular p53 . In the presence of cellular stresses, p53 undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications such as 1) phosphorylation which stabilizes p53 by disrupting its interaction with MDM2, 2) sequence-specific DNA binding, 3) transactivation where p53 activates or represses its target genes involved in the control of cell cycle, DNA repair, and induction of senescence and apoptosis (Figure 1) . In this article, we will be looking into the involvement of p53 and its mutations in the different processes associated with breast cancer development and review the various therapeutic strategies that are being developed to target wild-type and mutant p53 cancers. Theranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 4 1422 Figure 1. Under normal conditions, MDM2 regulates p53 protein. P53 is activated by hypoxia, activation of oncogenes, DNA damage, and nutrient deprivation to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and senescence. Functional effects of p53 DNA repair: As a tumor suppressor, p53 plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability by allowing time for DNA repair machinery to eliminate damaged lesions before cell proliferation resumes . Several DNA repair pathways regulated by p53 are the nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, and DNA double stranded break repair pathways including non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination . Cell cycle regulation: Cell-cycle checkpoints are important to prevent cells from progressing to the next phase of cell cycle before its prior phase has been accurately completed. In the presence of DNA damage, p53 is activated to regulate the G1-S and G2-M phase restriction points. Upon activation, p53 transcriptionally regulates p21, 14-3-3σ, Cdc25c, and GADD45 to promote cell cycle arrest . It was reported that p53 induces G1 arrest primarily through p21 transactivation. p21 inhibits cyclin E/CDK2 function, thereby inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb). Thus, Rb remains bound to E2F and the E2F-mediated transcription of cell cycle genes essential for G1 to S phase progression is inhibited. p53 also blocks G2/M by inhibiting cyclin B1/cdc2 functions through promoting 14-3-3σ expression upon DNA damage . Apoptosis: Multiple studies have reported that p53 plays an important role in triggering apoptosis [8, 9]. Both major signaling pathways that propagate apoptosis: extrinsic pathways and intrinsic pathways are mediated by p53 . p53 triggers the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of the cell death receptors Fas, Death Receptor 5, and death-domain containing receptor for TRAIL. This in the formation of the Death-inducing signaling complex to trigger a cascade of caspase activation, including caspase-8 and caspase-3 . p53 also triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by transactivating Bcl2 family proapoptotic genes, including BAX, Noxa, PUMA, and BID. The interaction of these genes promotes multimerization and trigger cytochrome c release, leading to the activation of caspase 9 . functional activation of BAX to Senescence: Senescence is an irreversible cell cycle arrest that can be induced by different types of cellular stresses. Upon induction of senescence, p53 is activated by either ATM/ATR or Chk1/2 protein to transactivate p21, thereby activating the Rb pathway . However, it is worth noting that p53 levels, Theranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 4 1423 kinetics, and threshold of stressor intensity can dictate if a cell decides to undergo senescence or apoptosis . Role of p53 in breast cancer TP53 status and prognosis in breast cancer Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disorder composed of several biological subtypes that have well-defined characteristics and responses to therapy . TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, constituting approximately 30% of all breast cancer cases . The majority of p53 mutations are located within the DNA binding domain and are caused by missense point mutations that inhibit its transcriptional activity (Figure 2). These mutations are highly linked to tumor subtypes (Figure 3A) and are associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients (Figure 3B) . luminal-like (luminal-A or Breast cancers are mainly divided into four molecular subtypes based on gene expression patterns: luminal-B), basal-like, normal-like, and HER-2 positive . The frequency of p53 mutation the luminal-like subtype (26%) with luminal-A having a lower mutation frequency (17%) than luminal-B (41%). In contrast, basal-like tumors have the highest frequency of p53 mutation (88%), while about half of HER2-amplified tumors (53%) harbor p53 mutations. The presence of p53 mutation and HER2 overexis associated with significantly worse pression prognosis compared to other subtypes . lowest in is It has also been shown that inflammatory breast cancer (50%) has a higher frequency of p53 mutations than non-inflammatory breast cancer (20-30%) . A recent paper reported that p53 mutations are associated with shorter overall survival in metastatic breast cancer across subtypes . The frequency of p53 mutations is also found to be higher in patients in advanced stage and high-grade tumors. Moreover, these mutations have been associated with subtypes with aggressive behavior such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) or HER2-amplified BC . Role of mutant p53 in cancer development and progression Besides exhibiting a dominant-negative activity that obstructs wild-type p53 functions, mutations in p53 can also acquire oncogenic activity by gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms in which the mutant protein interact with novel transcription factors or cofactors to regulate gene transcription and expression to drive cancer development (Figure 4) . Genome instability: Genome instability is an inherent hallmark of all types of human cancers. The GOF activity of mutant p53 has been shown to promote genome instability. In breast cancer samples, mutant p53 is associated with abnormal copy numbers . The p53 R172H mutant (R175H equivalent in mice) shows centrosome abnormalities the cyclinE-cdk2 by modulating centrosome, leading to centrosome amplification . Another study reported that mutant p53 can bind and increase the expression of chromatin-regulated genes, including methyltransferases MLL1 and MLL2 which enhance histone methylation and acetylation and contributes instability and cancer progression . to genomic activity at Evading apoptosis: Mutant p53 evades apoptosis by interacting with p53 family members, p63 and p73, to suppress their tumor suppressive activities . Several p53 mutations, such as the R273H and R175H, were reported to inhibit apoptosis by suppressing the expression of BCL2-modifying factor via enhanced AKT signaling and reducing p73 transcriptional activity on Bax promoter respectively . Proliferation: Mutant p53 proteins can activate the transcription of several genes associated with cell proliferation that are distinct from its wild-type counterpart . Several of these include c-MYC, MAP2K3, CXCL1, and CCNE2. Moreover, mutant p53 has been reported to interact with several proteins or that drive breast cancer transcription proliferation regulatory element-binding protein (SREBPs) via activation of mevalonate pathway , PARP , NF-Y , and DAB2IP . factors such sterol the as Figure 2. Distribution and frequency profile of TP53 mutations in breast cancer plotted using cBioPortal. Data were pooled from TCGA and METABRIC datasets (n=3593). Mutation types and their corresponding color codes are as follows: missense mutations (green), truncating mutations (black), in-frame mutations (red), and splice variants (orange). The top 3 most frequently altered residues are R248, R175, and R273. Theranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 4 1424 Figure 3. A. Frequency of p53 mutation in different breast cancer subtypes. B.

Data were pooled from TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Total n= 3065). Median overall survival of patients with mutant p53 and wild-type p53 is 133.23 (95% confidence interval: 111.97 - 159.07) and 164.03 (95% confidence interval: 152.07 – 173.03) in months respectively (p=0.000114). Figure 4. Mechanisms of inactivation of the tumor suppressive activity of wild-type p53 and GOF activities in mutant p53-bearing breast tumors. Theranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 4 1425 Metastasis: Mutant p53 has also been reported to enhance tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential via several mechanisms. One such mechanism is the stabilization of mutant p53 protein by Rab coupling protein-mediated secretion of Hsp90 which enhances cell invasion and metastasis in cancer cells . Mutant p53 also interacts with the G-protein coupled receptor (ADORA2B) , and Pin1 . Both interactions result in increased invasion and metastasis and are associated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer. adenosine A2b receptor, P53 as a therapeutic target: a two-sided approach While TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in breast cancer, more than two-thirds of breast cancer cases retain the wild-type status, of which the majority belongs to the luminal-like subtype . The p53 activity in these tumors is mainly suppressed by the overexpression of MDM2 or MDMX. For the other one-third of breast cancer cases, p53 function is inactivated by mutations, of which majority are observed in HER2+ and basal-like subtypes. As such, several mutation status-differentiated therapeutic strategies have been explored to target these two main mechanisms of p53 inactivation in order to restore its tumor suppressive functions. Therapies against wild-type p53-bearing breast cancer expression A deregulated balance between p53 and MDM2 can lead to malignant changes in normal cells. Approximately 7% of all human tumors have MDM2 . This gives MDM2 an gene amplification oncogene-like property. In breast cancer, approximately 38% of patients exhibit increased MDM2 . Furthermore, MDM2 protein expression is associated with the presence of estrogen receptors (ER) with higher MDM2 expression observed in ER+ cell lines . This makes MDM2 an attractive target for therapies especially in cancers with wild-type p53. Majority of therapies against MDM2 focus on either 1) inhibiting the MDM2-p53 interaction, 2) downregulating MDM2 expression, and 3) inhibiting its E3 ligase activity and its interaction with the proteasome to reduce p53 degradation and activate p53-dependent tumor suppressor pathways (Figure 5; Table 1).
