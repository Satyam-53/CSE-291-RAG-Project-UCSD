Email: naama.halpern@sheba.gov.il Background: Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal-dominant cancerpredisposition syndrome caused by germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in the TP53 gene. Classical autosomal-dominant inheritance predicts a 50% transmission rate of TP53 P/LPV from each carrier parent to their offspring. However, clinical observations suggest higher-than-expected carrier proportions, indicating a potential transmission ratio distortion (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate TRD in Israeli LFS families. Methods: Data from families with an LFS diagnosis who were followed at Sheba Medical Center between 2015 and 2024 were reviewed. Families that had complete clinical data and offspring were included. Pedigree analyses classified carriers as confirmed, obligate, or probable. Observed carrier proportions were compared with the expected 50% rate using one-sample t-tests. Results: Among 171 individuals from 20 families, 100 (58.5%) were identified as TP53 P/LPV confirmed or obligatory carriers, significantly exceeding the expected 50% inheritance rate (p = .027). A second analysis, which included 11 probable carriers, resulted in a carrier proportion of 64.9% (p < .001). TRD was observed across all phenotypic groups. No significant differences in TRD were observed by sex or variant type. Conclusions: This study revealed significant TRD in TP53 P/LPV inheritance among Israeli LFS families. A potential mechanism involves the role of TP53 in the cell cycle, in which reduced TP53 function may enhance embryonic cell proliferation, offering a survival or implantation advantage. TRD in LFS has implications for genetic counseling, reproductive decision making, and clinical management. These findings underscore the need for further research to validate TRD across diverse populations and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man The classical AD inheritance pattern of LFS predicts a 50% risk of identifier 151623) is a rare autosomal-dominant (AD) cancertransmission to offspring from affected carriers. However, observapredisposition syndrome primarily caused by germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in the TP53 gene.1 The estitions in Israeli LFS families suggest a higher-than-expected prevalence of TP53 P/LPV carriers among offspring, raising questions mated prevalence of LFS is between 1 in 3000 and 1 in 10,000 inabout deviations from Mendelian inheritance. This phenomenon, dividuals in the general population, with certain founder mutations including Brazilian, Ashkenazi identified among specific groups, Jewish, and Palestinian populations.2–5 LFS is associated with a wide spectrum of malignancies, manifesting in both childhood and adultknown as transmission ratio distortion (TRD), has been described in other genetic disorders.13–15 The proposed biologic mechanisms underlying TRD are thought to involve fertilization or early embryonic development.13 Studies conducted in mice and humans suggest hood, including sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas.6–8 that variations in TP53 may influence gamete function as well as embryo implantation.16–18 Although the syndrome is clinically heterogeneous, it is characThe objective of this study was to investigate the presence of terized by high penetrance, with females typically presenting with TRD in Israeli families affected by LFS, offering new insights into the cancer at a younger age compared with males (33.7 and 45.0 years, respectively).8 However, recent studies have suggested that earlier estimates of penetrance may have been inflated because of selection bias in early series, which primarily included families with severe clinical manifestations.5,8–11 The increased use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multigene panels has identified TP53 P/LPV inheritance dynamics of this syndrome and its implications for genetic counseling and risk assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS carriers who do not meet the classic clinical criteria for LFS, leading to For this study, we reviewed clinical and genetic data from families refined classifications, such as attenuated Li–Fraumeni syndrome (ALFS).6,9,12 This phenotype encompasses TP53 P/LPV carriers with a history of cancer who do not meet the traditional diagnostic criteria for LFS and typically have no malignancy onset before age 18 years.9,12 with at least two generations harboring a known TP53 P/LPV who were followed at the High-Risk Clinic at Sheba Medical Center between 2015 and 2024.

Inclusion criteria required knowledge of the carrier status of all offspring of a specific individual along with the availability of demographic data and information on the presence or absence of malignancies. Data on malignancies were confirmed based on pathology reports for patients who were actively followed in the clinic and on pedigree information for individuals who died. Data collection was conducted under an Institutional Review Boardapproved protocol. We provided each TP53 variants' functional data and their dominant-negative activity based on the TP53 Database.19–21 Pedigree analyses were conducted to assess the carrier status of offspring from confirmed carriers (genotyped individuals carrying TP53 P/LPVs), obligatory carriers (individuals whose offspring and another family member [sibling, nephew, niece, etc.] tested positive for TP53 P/LPVs), and probable carriers (individuals diagnosed with a malignancy before age 30 years who are a first-degree relative of a confirmed or obligatory carrier). Based on clinical and genetic criteria, families were categorized into three distinct phenotypic groups: (1) classic LFS included TP53 P/LPV carriers who met traditional clinical diagnostic criteria for LFS6; (2) Chompret criteria–based LFS7,22; and (3) ALFS, comprised of TP53 P/LPV carriers with a history of cancer who did not meet LFS testing criteria and had no cancer diagnosis before age 18 years.12 The observed proportion of TP53 P/LPV carriers among offspring was compared with the expected 50% inheritance rate predicted for AD conditions. We performed a one-sample t-test to determine whether the observed carrier proportions deviated significantly from the Mendelian expectation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata/IC software version 16.0 (StataCorp). In total, 171 individuals from 20 distinct families met the study criteria (Figure 1, Table 1).20,21 Among them, 100 patients (58.5%) were identified as TP53 P/LPV confirmed or obligatory carriers, significantly exceeding the expected 50% inheritance rate for AD conditions (p = .027). A second analysis, which included 11 probable carriers (Table 2), increased the carrier proportion to 64.9% (p < .001). The average number of individuals tested per family was 8.5 (range, 3–21), whereas the average number of carriers per family was 5.5 (range, 2–13). Two families (10%) exhibited a carrier proportion below 50% (40% and 43%, both with a phenotype of LFS), and three families (15%) displayed the expected 50% inheritance rate (two with ALFS phenotype and one with LFS phenotype). Among identified carriers, 67 individuals (60.0%) were cancer-free at the time of genotyping, and 59 (53.1%) were males. We analyzed the inheritance ratio based on the parent's sex and observed no significant difference: the carrier rate was 61% when inherited from the mother and 66.6% when inherited from the father (p = not significant). Moreover, no clear correlation was identified in our cohort between the functional classification of the variants, their dominant-negative activity, and the severity of either the phenotype or the TRD.

Israeli LFS families, with a higher-than-expected prevalence of carGenetic explanations, such as founder effects, appear less likely riers among offspring. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been previously reported in LFS. TRD has been described in several other hereditary syndromes, such as hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma, long-QT syndrome, and hereditary retinoblastoma.14,15,23 Although this has not been explicitly described in the literature for LFS, exploring the pedigrees presented in previous publications might support our findings.4,24 to explain our findings. Whereas rare founder mutations, such as the Brazilian p.R337H variant3 and the Ashkenazi Jewish p.G334R variant,4 have been documented, only three families in our cohort carried the Ashkenazi variant, exhibiting variable inheritance rates of 60%, 50%, and 40%. In addition, the absence of consanguinity across our cohort rules out inbreeding as a contributing factor. Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. The One potential explanation for why this phenomenon has not cohort included 20 families, limiting the generalizability of the findbeen reported in other non-Israeli cohorts may be demographic difings. Nonetheless, the large number of carriers per family provides ferences. The average number of children per family in Israel is 2.9, robust statistical power within the cohort. Referral bias toward which is the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation families with severe phenotypes also is a consideration. However, the and Development countries, compared with fewer than two children inclusion of ALFS families (eight families) and the proportion of in most other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations.25 Larger family sizes increase the likelihood of cancer-free and male carriers reduce the likelihood of significant bias. Phenotypic variability further complicates interpretation.
