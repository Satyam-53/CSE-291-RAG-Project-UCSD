Abstract 
Background  Recent genomics studies of breast cancer in Asian cohorts have found a higher prevalence of TP53 
mutations in Asian breast cancer patients relative to Caucasian patients. However, the effect of TP53 mutations on 
Asian breast tumours has not been comprehensively studied.

Methods  Here, we report an analysis of 492 breast cancer samples from the Malaysian Breast Cancer cohort where 
we examined the impact of TP53 somatic mutations in relation to PAM50 subtypes by comparing whole exome and 
transcriptome data from tumours with mutant and wild‑type TP53.

Results  We found that the magnitude of impact of TP53 somatic mutations appears to vary between different 
subtypes. TP53 somatic mutations were associated with higher HR deficiency scores as well as greater upregulation 
of gene expression pathways in luminal A and luminal B tumours compared to the basal‑like and Her2‑enriched sub‑
types. The only pathways that were consistently dysregulated when comparing tumours with mutant and wild‑type 
TP53 across different subtypes were the mTORC1 signalling and glycolysis pathways.

Conclusion  These results suggest that therapies that target TP53 or other downstream pathways may be more effec‑
tive against luminal A and B tumours in the Asian population.

Introduction
Breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer 
in Asian women, and the incidence rates of breast cancer 
among Asian women is predicted to increase in the com-
ing years [36]. Breast cancer in Asian women appears to 
have a distinct clinical presentation, with a younger age of 
onset and increased frequencies of HER2 + tumours rela-
tive  to  European  populations  [29].  Increasingly,  genom-
ics  studies  of  breast  tumours  in  Asian  women  suggest 
that they have a distinct molecular profile as well, with a 
more  active  immune  microenvironment  and  higher  fre-
quencies  of  TP53  somatic  mutations  compared  to  Cau-
casian women [13, 29, 41, 42]. Interestingly, even though 
TP53 somatic mutations are generally more common in 
ER-  tumours,  the  increased  prevalence  of  TP53  somatic 
mutations in Asian women relative to Caucasian women 
appears to be more pronounced in ER + tumours [2].

The  p53  protein  encoded  by  TP53  is  involved  in  wide 
range  of  cellular  stress  responses,  with  a  wide  range  of 
downstream effects including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, 
senescence,  DNA  repair  or  changes  in  metabolism  [19]. 
Somatic  TP53  mutations  are  typically  missense  muta-
tions  that  occur  in  almost  every  type  of  human  cancer, 
and  are  commonly  found  in  the  DNA-binding  domain 
of the p53 protein between exons 5 and 8 [26]. The TP53 
mutations  possibly  instigate  whole  or  fractional  loss  of 
protein function or gain of function (GOF) [25, 28].

The  frequency  and  type  of  TP53  somatic  mutations 
vary across the breast cancer PAM50 molecular subtypes 
and are most common in the basal-like tumour subtypes 
and  lowest  in  Luminal  A  subtype  [32].  Early  studies  in 
Caucasian  populations  suggested  that  the  prognostic 
significance  of  TP53  mutations  is  independent  of  hor-
mone receptor status [27]; however, more recent studies 
suggest that TP53 somatic mutations may have subtype-
specific  impacts  on  prognosis  [33].  Specifically,  muta-
tions in TP53 were associated with increased mortality in 
patients with luminal B, HER2-enriched and normal-like 
tumours  but  not  in  patients  with  luminal  A  and  basal-
like  tumours  [33].  In  contrast,  TP53  somatic  mutations 
in Asian breast cancer patients have been associated with 
slightly better overall survival in ER + patients, but not in 
ER- patients [29]. Thus, further exploration of the effect 
of TP53 somatic mutation in each PAM50 subtype across 
different  populations  may  uncover  population-specific 
data that could clarify the role of TP53 as a predictive or 
prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.

Here we report an analysis of TP53 somatic mutations 
in a cohort of 489 Malaysian female breast cancer patients 
of all ages. In this analysis, we compare various molecu-
lar characteristics between tumour samples with mutant 
TP53  and  wild-type  TP53  across  the  PAM50  molecular 
subtypes  using  whole  exome  and  whole  transcriptome 

data. We identify significant differences in HR deficiency 
scores, gene expression and molecular pathways that vary 
between  different  breast  cancer  subtypes,  but  appear  to 
be  particularly  pronounced  in  luminal  A  and  luminal  B 
tumours. These results may have clinical implications for 
the current and future use of therapies that target TP53 
or other downstream pathways in the Asian population.

Results
Cohort characteristics

The  MyBrCa  tumour  cohort  comprises  of  560  female 
patients  of  self-reported  Malaysian  nationality  with 
breast cancer who were recruited sequentially from a sin-
gle Malaysian private hospital, Subang Jaya Medical Cen-
tre (SJMC) [2]. Genetically, this cohort consists of a mix 
of  women  with  Chinese,  Malay  or  Indian  ancestry,  but 
overlaps  with  other  East/Southeast  Asian  populations 
according to genotyping analysis [2, 12]. From this initial 
cohort,  we  excluded  patient  samples  without  RNAseq 
data as well as patient samples with TP53 mutations clas-
sified as benign, likely benign, or uncertain significance/
conflicting  interpretations,  for  a  final  dataset  of  492 
samples from 489 patients (3 cases of bilateral tumours. 
Of  the  492  samples,  199  samples  were  classified  as  hav-
ing  mutant  TP53  (pathogenic/likely  pathogenic  somatic 
mutations),  and  the  remaining  293  samples  were  classi-
fied as wild-type TP53 to serve as our control group. No 
samples with germline TP53 mutations were included in 
this analysis.

Table  1  shows  the  relationship  between  TP53  somatic 
mutations  and  patients’  clinical  characteristics,  after 
excluding patients with bilateral tumours. We found sig-
nificant  differences  between  patients  with  wild-type  vs 
mutant  TP53  with  respect  to  PAM50  subtypes,  tumour 
grade  and  histological  subtype.  Samples  with  mutant 
TP53  were  associated  with  basal-like,  Her2-enriched 
tumours  and  higher  tumour  grade,  and  negatively  asso-
ciated with lobular carcinomas (Table 1). There were no 
significant differences observed between the two groups 
with respect to age at cancer diagnosis and tumour stage.

Characterisation of TP53 mutations

To investigate the role of TP53 mutations in the MyBrCa 
cohort, we began our analysis by comparing the location 
and  distribution  of  deleterious  mutations  in  the  TP53 
gene  between  the  main  PAM50  subtypes.  The  major-
ity  of  the  mutations  were  substitutions  (missense  and 
nonsense  mutations  (n = 139,  69.8%),  followed  by  frame 
shift indels (n = 41, 20.6%) and splice site variants (n = 13, 
6.5%).  However,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in 
the  location  of  the  mutations,  with  84.7%  of  mutations 
occurring in the DNA binding domain of TP53 for lumi-
nal  A  and  luminal  B  samples  and  86.2%  for  basal-like

and  Her2-enriched  samples  (Additional  file  1:  Fig.  S1). 
The  R273C  and  R175H  mutations,  known  to  be  com-
mon hotspot mutations in TP53, can be observed across 
all the subtypes at similar frequencies (Additional file 1: 
Table S1).

Mutational profiles of tumours with TP53 somatic 
mutations

Next,  we  examined  the  mutational  profile  of  tumour 
samples  for  differences  associated  with  mutant  TP53 
across  subtypes,  beginning  with  an  analysis  of  tumour 
mutational  burden.  Using  WES  data,  we  established  the 
total number of somatic mutations [small insertion–dele-
tions  (indels)  and  single-nucleotide  variants  (SNVs)]  for 

each  tumour  sample  and  additionally  included  tumours 
with  known  germline  and  somatic  BRCA   mutations  as 
a  positive  control.  As  expected,  tumours  with  germline 
and  somatic  BRCA   mutations  had  a  significantly  higher 
number  of  somatic  mutations  compared  to  non-carriers 
(p = 0.001, Fig. 1a). Similarly, tumours with TP53 somatic 
mutations  overall  had  a  significantly  higher  numbers  of 
somatic mutations compared to tumours with wild-type 
TP53 (p < 1e−5, Fig. 1a). However, although the number 
of  somatic  mutations  was  numerically  higher  in  mutant 
TP53  samples  compared  to  wild-type  TP53  samples  in 
each of the breast cancer subtypes, the results were sta-
tistically  significant  only  luminal  B  samples  (p = 0.008, 
Fig. 1a).

Following  that,  we  determined  the  proportion  of  the 
major  mutational  signatures  in  the  tumour  samples 
(Fig.  1b).  Mutational  signatures  are  characteristic  pat-
terns  of  mutations  associated  with  different  types  of 
DNA  damage  linked  to  various  exogenous  and  endog-
enous  mutagens,  as  well  as  DNA  repair  or  replicative 
mechanisms  [11].  These  signatures,  as  defined  by  the 
(https:// cancer. sanger. ac. uk/ signa 
COSMIC  database 
tures/),  include  the  age-related  signature  1,  homolo-
gous  recombination  (HR)  deficiency-related  signatures 
3 and 8, MMR-related signatures 6 and 15 and APOBEC 
enzyme-related  signatures  2  and  13  (Fig.  1b).  However, 
none  of  these  signatures  were  significantly  different 
between  mutant  and  wild-type  TP53  tumours  across 
the subtypes, suggesting that TP53 mutations have little 
effect on the mutational signatures of tumours (Fig. 1b). 
We did note small increases in the HR deficiency-related 
signatures 3 and 8 when TP53 is mutated in all subtypes 
except  Her2-enriched,  but  these  increases  were  not  sta-
tistically significant.

We  next  examined  other  features  of  HR  deficiency 
including  genomic  loss  of  heterozygosity  (LOH),  telom-
eric  allelic  imbalance  (TAI)  and  large-scale  state  transi-
tion  (LST),  as  well  as  an  overall  HRD-sum  score  that  is 
the total of these scar signature scores [1, 2, 30, 39]. When 
the results were aggregated across all subtypes, tumours 
with germline or somatic BRCA  mutations and tumours 
with  TP53  somatic  mutations  had  significantly  higher 
HR  deficiency  scores  compared  to  wild-type  tumours 
(p < 1e−5,  Fig.  1c).  Nevertheless,  when  examined  within 
subtypes, the increase in scores was more pronounced in 
luminal  A  and  luminal  B  tumours  and  less  pronounced 
in basal-like and Her2-enriched tumours (Fig. 1c). This is 
reflected  in  the  overall  HRD  scores  (HRD-sum),  where, 
in  subtype-specific  comparisons,  this  measure  was  sig-
nificantly  different  between  mutant  and  wild-type  TP53 
only in luminal A and luminal B tumours  (p < 1e−5 and 
p = 0.005), and not in the basal-like (p = 0.126) and Her2-
enriched (p = 0.254) subtypes (Fig. 1c).

Overall, these results suggest that TP53 somatic muta-
tions  are  associated  with  higher  numbers  of  somatic 
mutations and higher HR deficiency scores, as detectable 
by  whole-exome  sequencing.  However,  these  associa-
tions appear to be stronger and more consistent in lumi-
nal  A  and  B  tumours  and  weaker  in  Her2-enriched  and 
basal-like tumours, although it is important to note that 
differences  in  sample  sizes  for  each  subtype  may  have 
contributed to this result.

Differential gene expression analysis

Next,  to  determine  subtype-specific  transcriptomic 
changes  associated  with  of  TP53  somatic  mutations,  we 
employed  RNA-Seq  data  to  conduct  differential  gene 

expression  analyses  between  tumours  with  and  with-
out  TP53  somatic  mutations  in  each  of  the  four  main 
PAM50 molecular subtypes. The criteria for selecting dif-
ferentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  were  set  as  follows: 
(i)  absolute   log2  fold  change  more  than  1.5;  (ii)  p  value 
less  than  0.05.  A  comparison  of  upregulated  and  down-
regulated  DEGs  across  subtypes  revealed  that  there  was 
remarkably little overlap between different subtypes, with 
no  genes  that  overlapped  across  all  four  molecular  sub-
types  even  when  the  high  p  value  threshold  of  0.05  was 
used.  Additionally,  transcriptomic  differences  associated 
with TP53 somatic mutations appeared to be particularly 
pronounced in the luminal A subtype, which had a much 
higher  number  of  significantly  downregulated  genes 
compared to the other subtypes (Fig. 2; Additional file 2: 
Table S2).

To  understand  this  further,  we  conducted  pathway 
analyses  using  gene  set  enrichment  analysis  (GSEA) 
[24,  35].  To  investigate  the  overall  biological  impact  of 
TP53  somatic  mutations  on  the  tumours  of  MyBrCa 
patients,  we  focused  on  the  Hallmark  gene  sets  curated 
by MSigDB [18]. Comparison of the downregulated and 
upregulated  pathways  in  tumours  with  mutant  TP53 
revealed only one pathway that was consistently upregu-
lated  across  all  subtypes  (mTORC1  signalling),  and  two 
pathways that were upregulated in three subtypes (glyco-
lysis  and  UV  response  up).  Overall,  there  were  15  Hall-
mark pathways with significant differences in expression 
between mutant and wild-type TP53 in luminal A, 13 in 
luminal B, 10 in basal-like and only 2 in Her2-enriched. 
This  analysis  suggests  that  the  effect  of  TP53  mutations 
is  subtype  specific,  as  there  were  very  few  overlapping 
gene sets across molecular subtypes, and the subtypes are 
observed  to  have  largely  distinct  upregulated  or  down-
regulated pathways when TP53 is mutated (Fig. 2, Addi-
tional file 3: Table S3).

Together,  these  results  suggest  that  TP53  somatic 
mutations  are  associated  with  changes  to  the  tumour 
transcriptome  that  vary  by  breast  cancer  subtype,  with 
surprisingly  little  overlap.  The  DEG  and  GSEA  results 
also  suggest  that  the  association  between  TP53  somatic 
mutations  and  pathway  dysregulation  is  most  pro-
nounced in the luminal A subtype and least pronounced 
in the Her2-enriched subtype.

Single-sample pathway analysis

To  validate  and  further  explore  the  important  pathways 
associated  with  mutant  TP53  across  subtypes,  we  per-
formed  single-sample  GSEA  (ssGSEA)  analyses.  We 
analysed  the  ssGSEA  results  for  the  hallmark  pathways 
that  were  observed  to  overlap  across  three  or  four  sub-
types  (mTORC1  signalling,  glycolysis  and  UV  response 
up  pathways).  We  also  examined  three  other  Hallmark

gene such as DNA repair and cell cycle.

The ssGSEA analyses showed that TP53 somatic muta-
tions were consistently associated with the mTORC1 sig-
nalling  and  glycolysis  pathways  across  all  subtypes,  but 

found that the UV response up pathway was significantly 
different only in the luminal A subtype (Fig. 3). Addition-
ally, our analyses also showed that the P53 pathway was 
not  significantly  dysregulated  when  comparing  mutant 
and  wild-type  TP53  samples  within  each  subtype,  while 
the  DNA  repair  and  G2M  checkpoint  pathways  had

inconsistent  associations  with  TP53  somatic  mutations 
(DNA  Repair:  significantly  upregulated  only  in  luminal 
B (p = 0.027), G2M checkpoint: significantly upregulated 
in luminal A (p = 0.012) and basal-like (p = 0.042); Fig. 3). 
Notably, aggregating the data for mutant versus wild-type 
TP53 across all subtypes often led to different results in 
terms  of  statistical  significance  and/or  the  direction  of 
the  effect  due  to  the  higher  prevalence  of  TP53  somatic 
mutations in the basal and Her2-enriched subtypes cou-
pled  with  differences  in  gene  set  expression  between 
the  subtypes,  emphasising  the  importance  of  including 
tumour subtype as a covariate.

In summary, these data suggest that, across all molec-
ular  subtypes,  TP53  somatic  mutations  are  most  con-
sistently  associated  with  upregulation  of  the  mTORC1 
signalling  pathway,  as  well  as  the  glycolysis  pathway  to 
a lesser extent. On the other hand, TP53 somatic muta-
tions  have  only  small  and  inconsistent  associations  with 
transcriptional  alterations  in  the  p53,  DNA  repair  and 
cell  cycle  pathways.  Similar  to  our  previous  results,  the 
differences in pathway expression between samples with 
mutant  and  wild-type  TP53  appear  to  be  most  pro-
nounced in the luminal A subtype and least pronounced 
in the Her2-enriched subtype.

Cancer cell fraction

Next,  we  hypothesised  that  subtype-specific  differences 
in  the  mutational  and  transcriptional  profile  of  tumours 
with  TP53  somatic  mutations  may  be  due  to  TP53 
somatic  mutations  being  driver  versus  passenger  muta-
tions  in  different  molecular  subtypes.  Previous  analyses 
of  driver  mutations  found  in  tumours  from  the  TCGA 
dataset  have  found  that  most  driver  mutations  are  pre-
sent  at  a  high  cancer  cell  fraction  (CCF)  [7,  22].  Thus, 
to assess this hypothesis, we analysed data on the muta-
tional  CCF  of  TP53  in  individual  tumour  samples  that 
was generated by Pan et al. [29] from copy number data 
using an ASCAT pipeline. Interestingly, a comparison of 
TP53 CCF across breast cancer subtypes showed that the 
Her2-enriched  and  basal-like  subtypes  had  lower  TP53 
CCFs  compared  to  luminal  A  and  B  (Additional  file  1: 
Fig.  S2).  Furthermore,  we  also  compared  samples  with 
high TP53 CCF to samples with low TP53 CCF samples 
(categorised  according  to  the  median  value)  and  found 
that  samples  with  high  TP53  CCF  have  significantly 
higher  tumour  mutational  burden  and  HRD  scores  in 
comparison to samples with low TP53 CCF and wildtype 
TP53  samples  (Additional  file  1:  Fig.  S3).  These  find-
ings are consistent with TP53 mutations acting as driver 
mutations  in  luminal  A  and  luminal  B  tumours  but  as 
passenger mutations in the basal-like and Her2-enriched 
subtypes.

Discussion
In  this  study,  we  compared  the  molecular  profiles  of 
tumours  with  and  without  TP53  somatic  mutations  in 
a  cohort  of  489  Malaysian  breast  cancer  patients.  Using 
whole-exome  and  transcriptome  data,  we  conducted  an 
analysis of tumour mutational burden, mutational signa-
tures,  HR  deficiency  scores,  and  differentially  expressed 
genes  and  pathways.  Our  analyses  resulted  in  two  main 
findings: (i) the association between TP53 somatic muta-
tions and HR deficiency scores is stronger in the luminal 
A and luminal B subtypes, (ii) TP53 mutations are asso-
ciated  with  subtype-specific  gene  expression  differences 
that are more pronounced in the luminal A and luminal B 
subtypes, with only the mTORC1 and glycolysis pathways 
being  consistently  dysregulated  across  most  subtypes 
when TP53 is mutated. We suggest that these results may 
be due to due to TP53 somatic mutations generally being 
driver mutations in luminal A and luminal B tumours as 
opposed to sometimes being passenger mutations in the 
basal-like and Her2-enriched subtypes. Indeed, the can-
cer  cell  fraction  analyses  suggest  that  TP53  mutations 
may act as driver mutations in luminal A and luminal B 
tumours but as passenger mutations in the basal-like and 
Her2-enriched  subtypes.  Taken  together,  these  results 
highlight  the  importance  of  considering  molecular  sub-
type  when  examining  the  role  of  TP53  in  breast  cancer. 
These results also suggest that therapies for Asian breast 
cancer  that  target  p53  or  other  downstream  pathways 
may  be  more  effective  in  the  luminal  A  and  luminal  B 
tumour subtypes.

Given  that  TP53  is  known  to  have  important  roles  in 
DNA  repair  and  the  maintenance  of  genomic  stability 
[16,  32],  our  finding  that  TP53  somatic  mutations  are 
associated  with  an  increase  in  tumour  mutation  burden 
in  some  subtypes  is  not  surprising.  Similarly,  previous 
research has also shown that TP53 mutations are associ-
ated with chromosomal instability and high HRD scores 
[4,  15].  Our  results  confirm  that  these  associations  are 
also  present  in  a  large  cohort  of  Asian  breast  tumour 
samples.

We  also  found  an  association  between  TP53  somatic 
mutations  and  tumour  mutational  burden  in  our  data. 
The  direction  of  causality  between  TP53  mutations  and 
tumour mutational burden remains uncertain; a number 
of the detected TP53 mutations may be a consequence of 
increased tumour mutational burden. However, the asso-
ciation between TP53 mutations with HRD scores, cou-
pled with the lack of association between TP53 mutations 
and  mutational  signatures  such  as  aging  or  APOBEC-
related signatures, suggests to us that, generally speaking, 
TP53 mutations affect tumour mutational burden rather 
than the other way around.

Our results also indicate a strong association between 
TP53 somatic mutations and the mTORC1 signalling and 
glycolysis pathways in Asian breast cancer. The p53 pro-
tein is well known to inhibit mTORC1 signalling through 
multiple  mechanisms  [6,  8,  10]  in  response  to  cellular 
stresses such as DNA damage. Similarly, TP53 mutations 
have been shown to affect energy metabolism at multiple 
levels in TCGA breast cancer samples and mutant breast 
cancer cell lines [9, 20].

On the other hand, the weak association between TP53 
somatic mutation and p53 signalling, DNA repair and cell 
cycle  pathways  is  surprising,  given  the  known  functions 
of TP53. The lack of association between TP53 mutations 
and p53 signalling has been noted before in other cohorts 
[17]  and  may  be  due  to  the  existence  of  compensatory 
mechanisms [34, 40]. However, other studies have found 
strong associations between TP53 somatic mutations and 
transcriptional  changes  affecting  cell  cycle  progression 
[4].  Further  research  will  be  necessary  to  determine  if 
our results can be generalised to the wider Asian popula-
tion. Notably, when the data for mutant versus wild-type 
TP53 are aggregated across all subtypes, the results often 
lead to misleading conclusions due to differences in sam-
ple size, prevalence of TP53 mutations and expression of 
various gene sets between various subtypes, highlighting 
the importance of doing these comparisons in a subtype-
specific manner.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of our results is that 
the  associations  between  TP53  somatic  mutations  and 
genomic and transcriptomic changes are strongest in the 
luminal  A  and  B  subtypes  and  weaker  in  the  basal-like 
and  Her2-enriched  subtypes.  This  is  surprising  because 
the  prevalence  of  TP53  somatic  mutations  is  generally 
lower in the luminal A and B subtypes and higher in the 
basal-like  and  Her2-enriched  subtypes,  such  that  TP53 
has  been  considered  to  be  a  less  important  driver  gene 
for  luminal  A  and  luminal  B  subtypes  [32].  Our  results, 
on the other hand, suggest that this paradigm may not be 
as  applicable  to  luminal  A  and  luminal  B  breast  cancers 
arising in the Asian population, where TP53 may have a 
stronger  driver  role.  This  may  be  related  to  the  finding 
by previous studies that ER + tumours from Asian breast 
cancer patients have higher frequencies of TP53 somatic 
mutations  compared  to  ER + tumours  from  Western 
studies,  although  the  mechanism  behind  this  popula-
tion-specific  effect,  whether  genetic  or  environmental, 
remains to be elucidated [13, 29]. Other possible explana-
tions  for  the  lower  strength  of  associations  in  basal-like 
and  Her2-enriched  subtypes  are  that  basal-like  tumours 
are known to have high levels of intra-tumoural hetero-
geneity,  thus  diluting  the  transcriptional  effects  of  sub-
clonal TP53 mutations, while Her2-enriched tumours are 

primarily  driven  by  ERBB2  copy  number  amplification 
events which renders TP53 mutations less important.

Limitations of this study include differences in sample 
sizes  for  different  breast  cancer  subtypes  that  may  con-
found  our  subtype-specific  comparisons  due  to  differ-
ences in the power to detect significant changes between 
mutant  and  wildtype  samples.  Additionally,  our  study 
also  did  not  have  a  sufficient  sample  size  to  account  for 
differences  in  functional  effect  across  different  TP53 
mutations—an  important  caveat  that  deserves  further 
analysis  in  future  studies.  Accordingly,  we  have  chosen 
here to limit our study to an aggregate analysis based on 
a definition of pathogenicity that is similar to what might 
be encountered in routine clinical use.

In conclusion, TP53 somatic mutations in Asian breast 
cancer  are  associated  with  HR  deficiency  and  upregula-
tion  of  the  mTORC1  signalling  and  glycolysis  pathways. 
These associations appear to be stronger in luminal A and 
luminal  B  tumours,  and  weakest  in  the  Her2-enriched 
subtype,  which  may  be  an  important  consideration  for 
therapies  that  target  TP53  or  other  downstream  path-
ways  in  the  Asian  population.  These  results  may  also 
provide  useful  context  for  further  research  into  TP53 
somatic  mutations  as  predictive  or  prognostic  biomark-
ers for breast cancers arising in the Asian population.

Methods
Whole-exome and transcriptome dataset from the MyBrCa 
cohort

Our  study  employed  whole-exome  and  transcriptome 
data  of  tumour  samples  collected  from  the  MyBrCa 
cohort  that  has  been  described  previously  [29].  The 
MyBrCa  tumour  genomics  cohort  comprised  of  560 
breast cancer patients recruited as part of the Malaysian 
Breast  Cancer  (MyBrCa)  study  [38]  at  the  Subang  Jaya 
Medical  Centre,  whose  fresh  frozen  primary  tumours 
were  selected  to  undergo  deep  whole  exome  and  tran-
scriptome  sequencing.  Genomics  analyses  of  these 
patient tumour samples have been approved by the Eth-
ics Committee of Subang Jaya Medical Centre (reference 
no:  201208.1).  More  specific  details  on  the  sequencing 
methodology are available from the original publication.

Among the 560 patients, 29 tumour samples that had TP53 
mutations  with  unknown  or  uncertain  significance  or  con-
flicts over its pathogenicity (VUS) were excluded from this 
study, as only TP53 somatic mutations that were pathogenic 
or likely pathogenic according to ClinVar or Varsome were 
included in this study (see below). Other 39 patients without 
available WES or RNAseq data were excluded from further 
analysis for a final sample size of 492 samples. Tumour sam-
ples  were  categorised  as  either  mutant  or  wild-type  TP53, 
and no overlapping samples were included in each set.

Mapping and variant calling of TP53 mutations

Analysis  of  sequencing  data  was  performed  as  described 
previously in study by Pan et al. [29]. In summary, for WES, 
sequenced  reads  were  aligned  to  the  human  genome  b37 
plus  decoy  genome  by  utilising  bwa-mem  version  0.7.12 
[29].  Local  realignment,  duplicate  removal  and  base  qual-
ity recalibration were performed via the Genome Analysis 
Toolkit (GATK, v3.1.1) [23]. Somatic SNVs were identified 
via  GATK3  Mutect2  [23],  whereas  small  insertions  and 
deletions (indels) were established by Strelka2 [14].

The  variants  present  only  in  tumour  tissue  samples 
were  consequently  categorised  as  somatic  mutations. 
The  reference  sequences  for  numbering  were  based  on 
the  NCBI  GenBank  Database  for  TP53  (NM_000546.6). 
Clinical  variant  annotations  were  obtained  from  NCBI 
ClinVar  (http:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ clinv ar)  and  Var-
some  (https:// varso me. com/).  The  variants  are  consid-
ered  as  pathogenic  mutations  if  they  were  annotated  as 
“pathogenic”  or  “likely  pathogenic”  in  either  ClinVar  or 
Varsome.  TP53  mutations  with  unknown  or  uncertain 
significance (VUS) or with conflicts over its pathogenic-
ity were excluded from this study. No samples with ger-
mline TP53 mutations were included in the study.

Mutational signatures

Mutational signatures in each breast tumour sample were 
determined from annotated VCF files using deconstruct-
Sigs  [31],  using  the  single  base-pair  substitution  (SBS) 
signatures described in the COSMIC database.

HR deficiency scores

The  following  measures  of  HR  deficiency  were  estab-
lished as depicted earlier: [1] LOH, [2] LST and, [3] TAI 
[2,  39].  Allele-specific  copy  number  (ASCN)  profiles  on 
paired  normal-tumour  BAM  files  were  classified  via 
Sequenza  [5]  and  utilised  to  analyse  the  single  measure 
scores and HRD-sum scores via the scarHRD R package 
[37].

Gene expression analysis

Gene  expression  data  used  for  this  study  were  the  same 
as  in  the  original  analysis  (29).  Briefly,  RNA-seq  reads 
were  mapped  to  the  hs37d5  human  genome  and  the 
ENSEMBLE  GrCh37  release  87  human  transcriptome 
via  the  STAR  aligner  (v.2.5.3a)  [3].  Variant  calling  for 
RNA-seq data was also performed by utilising using the 
GATK Best Practices workflow for RNA-seq. Gene-level 
transcript  counts  were  obtained  using  featureCounts  (v. 
1.5.3).

Molecular classification based on gene expression data

Gene-level  count  matrices  for  the  cohort  were  trans-
formed into log2 counts-per-million (logCPM) using the 

voom function from the limma (v. 3.34.9) R package. The 
transformed matrices were then was subtyped according 
to PAM50 designations using the Genefu package in R (v. 
2.14.0).

Differential gene expression and functional enrichment 
analysis

Gene expression was analysed with the DEseq2 package, 
an  R-based  open-source  software  designed  to  analyse 
transcriptomic  data  for  differential  expression,  as  previ-
ously described [21]. GSEA was then performed for each 
downregulated and upregulated genes from each PAM50 
subtypes  using  Hallmark  Gene  set  [18,  24,  35].  Enrich-
ment analysis was done with default parameter settings. 
An  enrichment  score  was  calculated  for  each  gene  set 
(KS-statistics)  reflecting  if  the  genes  in  the  particular 
gene set appeared in the top (positive score), in the bot-
tom (negative score), or were randomly distributed (close 
to  zero  score).  These  scores  were  compared  with  scores 
calculated  from  1000  randomly  permuted  gene  lists,  in 
order  to  calculate  false  discovery  rates  (FDR)  (cutoff  at 
FDR = 0.05). The single sample gene set enrichment anal-
ysis (ssGSEA) was applied to analyse the RNA-seq data as 
well.  Hallmark  gene  sets  from  the  Molecular  Signatures 
Database were used for GSEA and ssGSEA analysis [18, 
24, 35].

Statistical analysis

The Mann–Whitney U test and the Chi-square test were 
executed  for  comparisons  of  variables  between  catego-
ries.  P < 0.05  was  considered  statistically  significant,  and 
all  tests  were  two-sided.  Statistical  analyses  were  per-
formed  using  R  v4.0.  All  box  and  whiskers  plots  in  the 
main  and  Additional  file  figures  are  constructed  with 
boxes  indicating  25th  percentile,  median  and  75th  per-
centile,  and  whiskers  showing  the  maximum  and  mini-
mum  values  within  1.5  times  the  inter-quartile  range 
from the edge of the box, with outliers not shown.
