BACKGROUND: Approximately 15% of all breast cancers occur in women with a family 
history of breast cancer, but for whom no causative hereditary gene mutation has 
been found. Screening guidelines for women with familial risk of breast cancer 
differ between countries. We did a randomised controlled trial (FaMRIsc) to 
compare MRI screening with mammography in women with familial risk.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled trial done in 12 hospitals 
in the Netherlands, women were eligible to participate if they were aged 30-55 
years and had a cumulative lifetime breast cancer risk of at least 20% because 
of a familial predisposition, but were BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 wild-type. 
Participants who were breast-feeding, pregnant, had a previous breast cancer 
screen, or had a previous a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ were eligible, 
but those with a previously diagnosed invasive carcinoma were excluded. 
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either annual MRI and 
clinical breast examination plus biennial mammography (MRI group) or annual 
mammography and clinical breast examination (mammography group). Randomisation 
was done via a web-based system and stratified by centre. Women who did not 
provide consent for randomisation could give consent for registration if they 
followed either the mammography group protocol or the MRI group protocol in a 
joint decision with their physician. Results from the registration group were 
only used in the analyses stratified by breast density. Primary outcomes were 
number, size, and nodal status of detected breast cancers. Analyses were done by 
intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial 
Register, number NL2661.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2017, 1355 women provided consent for 
randomisation and 231 for registration. 675 of 1355 women were randomly 
allocated to the MRI group and 680 to the mammography group. 218 of 231 women 
opting to be in a registration group were in the mammography registration group 
and 13 were in the MRI registration group. The mean number of screening rounds 
per woman was 4·3 (SD 1·76). More breast cancers were detected in the MRI group 
than in the mammography group (40 vs 15; p=0·0017). Invasive cancers (24 in the 
MRI group and eight in the mammography group) were smaller in the MRI group than 
in the mammography group (median size 9 mm [5-14] vs 17 mm [13-22]; p=0·010) and 
less frequently node positive (four [17%] of 24 vs five [63%] of eight; 
p=0·023). Tumour stages of the cancers detected at incident rounds were 
significantly earlier in the MRI group (12 [48%] of 25 in the MRI group vs one 
[7%] of 15 in the mammography group were stage T1a and T1b cancers; one (4%) of 
25 in the MRI group and two (13%) of 15 in the mammography group were stage T2 
or higher; p=0·035) and node-positive tumours were less frequent (two [11%] of 
18 in the MRI group vs five [63%] of eight in the mammography group; p=0·014). 
All seven tumours stage T2 or higher were in the two highest breast density 
categories (breast imaging reporting and data system categories C and D; 
p=0·0077) One patient died from breast cancer during follow-up (mammography 
registration group).
INTERPRETATION: MRI screening detected cancers at an earlier stage than 
mammography. The lower number of late-stage cancers identified in incident 
rounds might reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and decrease breast 
cancer-related mortality. However, the advantages of the MRI screening approach 
might be at the cost of more false-positive results, especially at high breast 
density.

Premenopausal breast cancer (BC) is a core tumor of Li-Fraumeni (LFS) and 
Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) Syndromes, predisposition disorders caused by germline 
mutations in TP53 gene. In the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil, a 
specific TP53 germline mutation, c.1010G>A (p.Arg337His), was identified at a 
population frequency of 0.3%, the highest value ever described for a TP53 
germline variation. In Brazilian BC patients, carrier frequency can vary from 
0.5% to 8.7%. The current study assessed carrier frequency by genotyping TP53 
c.1010G>A in 2 BC groups: 1) 315 patients unselected for age of diagnosis and 
family history (FH) and 2) 239 patients diagnosed before 46 years and without 
Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. One carrier was identified in group 1 (0.3%; 
CI 95% 0.1-1.76%) and six carriers in group 2 (2.5%; CI 95% 0.93-5.39%). The 
frequencies differed significantly between groups (p = 0.04). The mutation 
carrier frequency observed in group 2 could justify mutation testing in BC 
patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. 
Further studies in larger samples of BC patients of different ages and regions 
of the country are necessary to provide more definitive TP53 p.Arg337His carrier 
frequencies in different scenarios.

BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with large, hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive/HER2-negative and low-proliferative breast cancer derived a 
benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in the CARMINA02 trial. This 
study was designed to correlate gene expression and mutation profiles with both 
response to NET and prognosis.
METHODS: Gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing was performed in 86 
pre-NET and post-NET tumor samples. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 91 
candidate breast cancer-associated genes was performed on DNA samples from 89 
patients. Molecular data were correlated with radiological response and 
relapse-free survival.
RESULTS: The transcriptional profile of tumors to NET in responders involved 
immune-associated genes enriched in activated Th1 pathway, which remained 
unchanged in non-responders. Immune response was confirmed by analysis of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The percentage of TILs was significantly 
increased post-NET compared to pre-NET samples in responders (p = 0.0071), but 
not in non-responders (p = 0.0938). Gene expression revealed that lipid 
metabolism was the main molecular function related to prognosis, while PPARγ is 
the most important upstream regulator gene. The most frequently mutated genes 
were PIK3CA (48.3%), CDH1 (20.2%), PTEN (15.7%), TP53 (10.1%), LAMA2 (10.1%), 
BRCA2 (9.0%), MAP3K1 (7.9%), ALK (6.7%), INPP4B (6.7%), NCOR1 (6.7%), and NF1 
(5.6%). Cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway were 
altered significantly more frequently in non-responders than in responders 
(p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0094, respectively). The average number of mutations per 
sample was significantly higher in endocrine-resistant tumors (2.88 vs. 1.64, 
p = 0.03), but no difference was observed in terms of prognosis. ESR1 hotspot 
mutations were detected in 3.4% of treatment-naive tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: The Th1-related immune system and lipid metabolism appear to play 
key roles in the response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in 
HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Deleterious somatic mutations in the 
cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway may be relevant for 
clinical management.

Breast cancer, one of the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide, is the 
leading cause of cancer-related death among women. AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 
mutations were common observed in breast cancer representing potential clinical 
biomarkers for cancer classification and treatment. A comprehensive knowledge of 
AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 mutations in breast cancer was still insufficient in 
Chinese population. In this study, the complete coding regions and exon-intron 
boundaries of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 genes were sequenced in paired breast 
tumor and normal tissues from 313 Chinese breast cancer patients using 
microfluidic PCR-based target enrichment and next-generation sequencing 
technology. Total 120 somatic mutations were identified in 190 of the 313 
patients (60.7%), with the mutation frequency of AKT1 as 3.2%, PIK3CA as 36.4%, 
PTEN as 4.8%, and TP53 as 33.9%. Among these mutations, 1 in PIK3CA (p.I69N), 3 
in PTEN (p.K62X, c.635-12_636delTTAACCATGCAGAT and p.N340IfsTer4) and 5 in TP53 
(p.Q136AfsTer5, p.K139_P142del, p.Y234dup, p.V274LfsTer31 and p.N310TfsTer35) 
were novel. Notably, PIK3CA somatic mutations were significantly associated with 
ER-positive or PR-positive tumors. TP53 somatic mutations were significantly 
associated with ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive, BRCA1 mutation, Ki67 
high expression and basal-like tumors. Our findings provided a comprehensive 
mutation profiling of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 genes in Chinese breast cancer 
patients, which have potential implications in clinical management.

BACKGROUND: Circulating free DNA sequencing (cfDNA-Seq) can portray cancer 
genome landscapes, but highly sensitive and specific technologies are necessary 
to accurately detect mutations with often low variant frequencies.
METHODS: We developed a customizable hybrid-capture cfDNA-Seq technology using 
off-the-shelf molecular barcodes and a novel duplex DNA molecule identification 
tool for enhanced error correction.
RESULTS: Modeling based on cfDNA yields from 58 patients showed that this 
technology, requiring 25 ng of cfDNA, could be applied to >95% of patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). cfDNA-Seq of a 32-gene, 163.3-kbp target 
region detected 100% of single-nucleotide variants, with 0.15% variant frequency 
in spike-in experiments. Molecular barcode error correction reduced 
false-positive mutation calls by 97.5%. In 28 consecutively analyzed patients 
with mCRC, 80 out of 91 mutations previously detected by tumor tissue sequencing 
were called in the cfDNA. Call rates were similar for point mutations and 
indels. cfDNA-Seq identified typical mCRC driver mutations in patients in whom 
biopsy sequencing had failed or did not include key mCRC driver genes. Mutations 
only called in cfDNA but undetectable in matched biopsies included a subclonal 
resistance driver mutation to anti-EGFR antibodies in KRAS, parallel evolution 
of multiple PIK3CA mutations in 2 cases, and TP53 mutations originating from 
clonal hematopoiesis. Furthermore, cfDNA-Seq off-target read analysis allowed 
simultaneous genome-wide copy number profile reconstruction in 20 of 28 cases. 
Copy number profiles were validated by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: This error-corrected, ultradeep cfDNA-Seq technology with a 
customizable target region and publicly available bioinformatics tools enables 
broad insights into cancer genomes and evolution.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination of cancer patients with p53-expressing modified vaccinia 
Ankara virus (p53MVA) has shown in our previous studies to activate p53-reactive 
T cells in peripheral blood but without immediate clinical benefit. We 
hypothesized that the immunological responses to p53MVA vaccine may require 
additional immune checkpoint blockade to achieve clinically beneficial levels. 
We therefore conducted a phase I trial evaluating the combination of p53MVA and 
pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with advanced breast, pancreatic, 
hepatocellular, or head and neck cancer received up to 3 triweekly vaccines in 
combination with pembrolizumab given concurrently and thereafter, alone at 
3-week intervals until disease progression. The patients were assessed for 
toxicity and clinical response. Correlative studies analyzed p53-reactive T 
cells and profile of immune function gene expression.
RESULTS: We observed clinical responses in 3/11 patients who remained with 
stable disease for 30, 32, and 49 weeks. Two of these patients showed increased 
frequencies and persistence of p53-reactive CD8+ T cells and elevation of 
expression of multiple immune response genes. Borderline or undetectable 
p53-specific T cell responses in 7/11 patients were related to no immediate 
clinical benefit. The first study patient had a grade 5 fatal myocarditis. After 
the study was amended for enhanced cardiac monitoring, no additional cardiac 
toxicities were noted.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that the combination of p53MVA vaccine with 
pembrolizumab is feasible, safe, and may offer clinical benefit in select group 
of patients that should be identified through further studies.

Purpose: Response to a complex trastuzumab-based regimen is affected by multiple 
features of the tumor and its microenvironment. Developing a predictive 
algorithm is key to optimizing HER2-targeting therapy.Experimental Design: We 
analyzed 137 pretreatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exome sequencing from 
CALGB 40601, a neoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab with 
or without lapatinib in stage II to III HER2-positive breast cancer. We adopted 
an Elastic Net regularized regression approach that controls for covarying 
features within high-dimensional data. First, we applied 517 known gene 
expression signatures to develop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we 
validated on 143 samples from four independent trials. Next, we performed 
integrative analyses incorporating clinicopathologic information with somatic 
mutation status, DNA copy number alterations (CNA), and gene signatures.Results: 
The Elastic Net model using only gene signatures predicted pCR in the validation 
sets (AUC = 0.76). Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene 
signatures, clinical features, and DNA information were better pCR predictors 
than models containing a single data type. Frequently selected variables from 
the multiplatform models included amplifications of chromosome 6p, TP53 
mutation, HER2-enriched subtype, and immune signatures. Variables predicting 
resistance included Luminal/ER+ features.Conclusions: Models using RNA only, as 
well as integrated RNA and DNA models, can predict pCR with improved accuracy 
over clinical variables. Somatic DNA alterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor 
molecular subtype (HER2E, Luminal), and the microenvironment (immune cells) were

PURPOSE: HER2 + breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive subtype with high rates of 
brain metastases (BCBM). Two-thirds of HER2 + BCBM demonstrate activation of the 
PI3K/mTOR pathway driving resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. This phase II study 
evaluated everolimus (E), a brain-permeable mTOR inhibitor, trastuzumab (T), and 
vinorelbine (V) in patients with HER2 + BCBM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had progressive HER2 + BCBM. The primary 
endpoint was intracranial response rate (RR); secondary objectives were CNS 
clinical benefit rate (CBR), extracranial RR, time to progression (TTP), overall 
survival (OS), and targeted sequencing of tumors from enrolled patients. A 
two-stage design distinguished intracranial RR of 5% versus 20%.
RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity, 26 for efficacy. Intracranial 
RR was 4% (1 PR). CNS CBR at 6 mos was 27%; at 3 mos 65%. Median intracranial 
TTP was 3.9 mos (95% CI 2.2-5). OS was 12.2 mos (95% CI 0.6-20.2). Grade 3-4 
toxicities included neutropenia (41%), anemia (16%), and stomatitis (16%). 
Mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were common in BCBM. Mutations in the PI3K/mTOR 
pathway were not associated with response. ERBB2 amplification was higher in 
BCBM compared to primary BC; ERBB2 amplification in the primary BC trended 
toward worse OS.
CONCLUSION: While intracranial RR to ETV was low in HER2 + BCBM patients, 
one-third achieved CNS CBR; TTP/OS was similar to historical control. No new 
toxicity signals were observed. Further analysis of the genomic underpinnings of 
BCBM to identify tractable prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers is warranted.

IMPORTANCE: A range of somatic driver alterations has been described in estrogen 
receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early breast cancer (BC); however, 
the clinical relevance is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of driver alterations with prognosis and 
the role of PIK3CA mutations in prediction of benefit associated with endocrine 
therapy in postmenopausal patients with ER+/HER2- early BC treated with 
tamoxifen or letrozole.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 
trial randomized 8010 postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, 
operable, invasive BC to monotherapy with letrozole, tamoxifen, or a sequential 
strategy for 5 years. Driver alterations were characterized using 
next-generation sequencing in primary tumors from a subset of 764 patients from 
7329 eligible patients with ER+/HER2- BC, with 841 distant recurrences after a 
median of 8.1 years of follow-up. To correct for the oversampling of distant 
recurrences, weighted analysis methods were used. This analysis was conducted 
from April 4, 2016, to November 30, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of driver alterations, associations 
with clinicopathologic factors, distant recurrence-free interval, and treatment 
interactions were analyzed. Multivariable analyses were performed to adjust for 
clinicopathologic factors.
RESULTS: Of 764 samples, 538 (70.4%), including 140 distant recurrence events, 
were successfully sequenced. Nineteen driver alterations were observed with 5% 
or greater frequency, with a mean of 4 alterations (range, 0-15) per tumor. 
PIK3CA mutations were the most common (49%) and were significantly associated 
with reduction in the risk for distant recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% 
CI, 0.38-0.85; P = .006). TP53 mutations (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.21-3.04; 
P = .006), amplifications on 11q13 (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.36-3.37; P = .001) and 
8p11 (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.88-4.84; P < .001), and increasing number of driver 
alterations (HR per additional alteration, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25; P < .001) 
were associated with significantly greater risk. Amplifications on 11q13 and 
8p11 remained significant predictors in multivariable analysis, but not PIK3CA 
and TP53 mutations. Patients with tumors harboring kinase or helical domain 
PIK3CA mutations derived significantly greater benefit from letrozole over 
tamoxifen than patients whose tumors did not (P interaction = .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In ER+/HER2- postmenopausal, early-stage BC, 
amplifications on 11q13 and 8p11 were significantly associated with increased 
risk for distant recurrence and PIK3CA mutations were predictive of greater 
magnitude of benefit from letrozole. With these findings, DNA-based 
classification may aid adjuvant treatment decision making in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibition following 
chemotherapy-elicited DNA damage overrides cell cycle arrest and induces mitotic 
catastrophe and cell death. GDC-0575 is a highly-selective oral small-molecule 
Chk1 inhibitor that results in tumor shrinkage and growth delay in xenograft 
models. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of 
GDC-0575 alone and in combination with gemcitabine. Antitumor activity and Chk1 
pathway modulation were assessed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase I open-label study, in the dose escalation 
stage, patients were enrolled in a GDC-0575 monotherapy Arm (1) or GDC-0575 
combination with gemcitabine Arm (2) to determine the maximum tolerated dose. 
Patients in arm 2 received either i.v. gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (arm 2a) or 
500 mg/m2 (arm 2b), followed by GDC-0575 (45 or 80 mg, respectively, as RP2D). 
Stage II enrolled disease-specific cohorts.
RESULTS: Of 102 patients treated, 70% were female, the median age was 59 years 
(range 27-85), and 47% were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0. The most 
common tumor type was breast (37%). The most frequent adverse events (all 
grades) related to GDC-0575 and/or gemcitabine were neutropenia (68%), anemia 
(48%), nausea (43%), fatigue (42%), and thrombocytopenia (35%). Maximum 
concentrations of GDC-0575 were achieved within 2 hours of dosing, and half-life 
was ∼23 hours. No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed between 
GDC-0575 and gemcitabine. Among patients treated with GDC-0575 and gemcitabine, 
there were four confirmed partial responses, three occurring in patients with 
tumors harboring TP53 mutation. Pharmacodynamic data were consistent with 
GDC-0575 inhibition of gemcitabine-induced expression of pCDK1/2.
CONCLUSION: GDC-0575 can be safely administered as a monotherapy and in 
combination with gemcitabine; however, overall tolerability with gemcitabine was 
modest. Hematological toxicities were frequent but manageable. Preliminary 
antitumor activity was observed but limited to a small number of patients with a 
variety of refractory solid tumors treated with GDC-0575 and gemcitabine.

BACKGROUND: The phase III MONALEESA-2 study demonstrated significantly prolonged 
progression-free survival (PFS) and a manageable toxicity profile for first-line 
ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole in patients with hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Here, we report updated efficacy and safety 
data, together with exploratory biomarker analyses, from the MONALEESA-2 study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- 
recurrent/metastatic breast cancer were randomized (1 : 1; stratified by 
presence/absence of liver and/or lung metastases) to ribociclib (600 mg/day; 
3-weeks-on/1-week-off; 28-day treatment cycles) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day; 
continuous) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was locally 
assessed PFS. The key secondary end point was overall survival (OS). Other 
secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Biomarker 
analysis was an exploratory end point.
RESULTS: At the time of the second interim analysis, the median duration of 
follow-up was 26.4 months. Median PFS was 25.3 months [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 23.0-30.3] for ribociclib plus letrozole and 16.0 months (95% CI 13.4-18.2) 
for placebo plus letrozole (hazard ratio 0.568; 95% CI 0.457-0.704; log-rank 
P = 9.63 × 10-8). Ribociclib treatment benefit was maintained irrespective of 
PIK3CA or TP53 mutation status, total Rb, Ki67, or p16 protein expression, and 
CDKN2A, CCND1, or ESR1 mRNA levels. Ribociclib benefit was more pronounced in 
patients with wild-type versus altered receptor tyrosine kinase genes. OS data 
remain immature, with 116 deaths observed; 50 in the ribociclib arm and 66 in 
the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.746; 95% CI 0.517-1.078). The ORR was 42.5% 
versus 28.7% for all patients treated with ribociclib plus letrozole versus 
placebo plus letrozole, respectively, and 54.5% versus 38.8%, respectively, for 
patients with measurable disease. Safety results, after a further 11.1 months of 
follow-up, were comparable with those reported at the first analysis, with no 
new or unexpected toxicities observed, and no evidence of cumulative toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: The improved efficacy outcomes and manageable tolerability observed 
with first-line ribociclib plus letrozole are maintained with longer follow-up, 
relative to letrozole monotherapy.
