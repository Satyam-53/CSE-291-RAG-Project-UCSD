OBJECTIVES: To determine whether 6 months of preoperative apalutamide for 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IRPCa) reduces the aggregate postoperative 
radiotherapy risk and to evaluate associations of molecular perturbations with 
clinical outcomes in this study cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2018 and February 2020, eligible patients with 
IRPCa (Gleason 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 and clinical T2b-c or prostate-specific antigen 
level of 10-20 ng/mL) were treated with apalutamide 240 mg/day for 6 months 
followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) in this single-arm, phase II trial. The 
primary endpoint was presence of any adverse pathological feature at risk of 
pelvic radiation (pathological T stage after neoadjuvant therapy [yp]T3 or ypN1 
or positive surgical margins). Translational studies, including germline and 
somatic DNA alterations and RNA and protein expression, were performed on 
post-apalutamide RP specimens, and assessed for associations with clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 40 patients underwent a RP, and only one patient 
discontinued apalutamide prior to 6 months. In all, 40% had adverse pathological 
features at time of RP, and the 3-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was 
15%, with 27.5% being not evaluable. Genomic alterations frequently seen in 
metastatic PCas, such as androgen receptor (AR), tumour protein p53 (TP53), 
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), or BReast CAncer associated gene 
(BRCA1/2) were underrepresented in this localised cohort. Adverse pathological 
features and BCR at 3-years were associated with increased expression of select 
cell cycle (e.g., E2F targets: adjusted P value [Padj] < 0.001, normalised 
enrichment score [NES] 2.47) and oxidative phosphorylation (Padj < 0.001, NES 
1.62) pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative apalutamide did not reduce the aggregate postoperative 
radiation risk to the pre-specified threshold in unselected men with IRPCa. 
However, transcriptomic analysis identified key dysregulated pathways in tumours 
associated with adverse pathological outcomes and BCR, which warrant future 
study. Further investigation of preoperative therapy is underway for men with 
high-risk PCa.

Dyslipidemia is a component of metabolic syndrome, having an important role in 
the carcinogenesis of different tumor types, such as prostate, ovarian, or renal 
cancer. The number of studies on the predictive potential of the different 
components of the lipid profile with a predictive potential in breast cancer is 
quite low. The evaluation of the lipid profile was carried out for the 142 
patients who benefited from neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) in order to identify a 
potential predictive biomarker. The serological sample collection was performed 
sequentially according to a standardized protocol, pre-NAC, post-NAC and 6 
months post-NAC after a 6-h pre-collection fast. We also investigated in the 
general group the presence or absence of the p53 mutation (TP53) and of the 
mitotic index ki-67, respectively, in relation to the molecular subtypes. The 
menopausal status, tumor size, family history, grading, Ki-67, p53 and LN 
metastases have a predictive nature regarding overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05), 
while for disease free survival (DFS), only tumor size, tumor grading, Ki-67 > 
14, and p53+ are of predictive nature. The genetic and molecular analysis 
carried out in our group indicates that 71.67% have a Ki-67 score higher than 
14%, and 39% of the patients have the positive P53 mutation. The multivariate 
analysis in the case of patients included in the TNBC subtype showed that the 
increased tumor volume (p = 0.002) and increased level of HDL (p = 0.004) 
represent predictive factors for the tumor response rate to NAC. High HDL-C 
levels before NAC and increased LDL-C levels after NAC were associated with the 
better treatment response in ER-positive and HER2+ breast cancer patients. 
Increased HDL-C values and tumor volume represent predictive factors as to the 
response rate to NAC in the case of patients included in the TNBC subtype. 
Regarding the ER+ and HER2+ subtypes, increased levels of HDL-C pre-NAC and 
increased levels of LDL-C post-NAC were associated with a better therapeutic 
response rate. Tumor grading, Ki-67, p53, and LN metastases have a predictive 
nature for OS, while tumor size, tumor grading, and Ki-67 > 14, and p53+ are 
predictive for DFS.

PURPOSE: To identify prognostic circulating biomarkers to cyclin-dependent 
kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), we performed a mutational analysis on 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples from patients included in the TREnd trial, 
which randomly assigned patients to receive the CDK4/6i palbociclib alone or 
with the endocrine treatment (ET) to which they had progressed.
METHODS: Forty-six patients were enrolled in this substudy. Plasma was collected 
before treatment (T0), after the first cycle of therapy (T1), and at the time of 
progression (T2). ctDNA hybridization and capture were performed using the 
Illumina TruSight Tumor 170 Kit. Acquired mutations were confirmed by digital 
polymerase chain reaction. Progression-free survival analysis was estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.
RESULTS: The most frequently mutated genes at T0 were ESR1 (23%), PIK3CA (17%), 
AR, FGFR2, and TP53 (10%). Mutations in ESR1 at T0 conferred higher risk of 
progression in the entire population (P = .02) and in patients treated with 
palbociclib + ET (P = .04). ESR1 mutation effect remained significant after 
correction for clinical variables (P = .03). PIK3CA mutations at T0 were not 
prognostic, but higher risk of progression was observed when a broader analysis 
of PI3K pathway was performed (P = .04). At T2, we observed the emergence of 
nine new mutations in seven genes.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in ESR1 and in PI3K pathway genes at T0 were associated 
with worse prognosis in palbociclib-treated patients. We describe the emergence 
of newly acquired mutations in palbociclib-treated patients, which might 
potentially affect subsequent treatment.

CFI-400945 is a selective oral polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) inhibitor that 
regulates centriole duplication. PLK4 is aberrantly expressed in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Preclinical studies indicate that CFI-400945 has 
potent in vivo efficacy in hematological malignancies and xenograft models, with 
activity in cells harboring TP53 mutations. In this phase 1 study in very 
high-risk patients with relapsed/refractory AML and myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) (NCT03187288), 13 patients were treated with CFI-400945 continuously in 
dose escalation from 64 mg/day to 128 mg/day. Three of the 9 efficacy evaluable 
AML patients achieved complete remission (CR). Two of 4 AML patients (50%) with 
TP53 mutations and complex monosomal karyotype achieved a CR with 1 patient 
proceeding to allogenic stem cell transplant. A third patient with TP53 mutated 
AML had a significant reduction in marrow blasts by > 50% with an improvement in 
neutrophil and platelet counts. Responses were observed after 1 cycle of 
therapy. Dose-limiting toxicity was enteritis/colitis. A monotherapy and 
combination therapy study with a newer crystal form of CFI-400945 in patients 
with AML, MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is ongoing 
(NCT04730258).

BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in the use of liquid biopsies, but data 
on longitudinal analyses of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) remain relatively 
limited. Here, we report a longitudinal ctDNA analysis of MONALEESASIA, a phase 
Ib trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy 
(ET) in Asian patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor-2-negative advanced breast cancer.
METHODS: MONALEESASIA enrolled premenopausal and postmenopausal Japanese and 
postmenopausal non-Japanese Asian patients. All patients received ribociclib 
with ET (letrozole, fulvestrant, or tamoxifen with goserelin). ctDNA was 
analyzed using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel of 572 cancer-related 
genes and correlated by best overall response (BOR).
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-four cell-free DNA samples from 87 patients were 
tested. The most frequently altered genes at baseline included PIK3CA (29%) and 
TP53 (22%). Treatment with ribociclib plus ET decreased ctDNA in most patients 
at the first on-treatment time point, regardless of dose or ET partner. Patients 
with partial response and stable disease had lower ctDNA at baseline that 
remained low until data cutoff if no progressive disease occurred. Most patients 
with progressive disease as the best response had higher ctDNA at baseline that 
remained high at the end of treatment. For patients with partial response and 
stable disease with subsequent progression, ctDNA increased towards the end of 
treatment in most patients, with a median lead time of 83 days (14-309 days). In 
some patients with BOR of partial response who experienced disease 
progression later, specific gene alterations and total ctDNA fraction increased; 
this was sometimes observed concurrently with the development of new lesions 
without a change in target lesion size. Patients with alterations in PIK3CA and 
TP53 at baseline had shorter median progression-free survival compared with 
patients with wild-type PIK3CA and TP53, 12.7 and 7.3 months vs 19.2 and 
19.4 months, respectively (P = .016 and P = .0001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher ctDNA levels and PIK3CA and TP53 alterations detected at 
baseline were associated with inferior outcomes. On-treatment ctDNA levels were 
associated with different patterns based on BOR. Longitudinal tracking of ctDNA 
may be useful for monitoring tumor status and detection of alterations with 
treatment implications.

Samuraciclib is a selective oral CDK7-inhibitor. A multi-modular, open-label 
Phase I study to evaluate safety and tolerability of samuraciclib in patients 
with advanced malignancies was designed (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03363893). Here 
we report results from dose escalation and 2 expansion cohorts: Module 1A dose 
escalation with paired biopsy cohort in advanced solid tumor patients, Module 
1B-1 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) monotherapy expansion, and Module 2A 
fulvestrant combination in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients 
post-CDK4/6-inhibitor. Core study primary endpoints are safety and tolerability, 
and secondary endpoints are pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) 
activity, and anti-tumor activity. Common adverse events are low grade nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea. Maximum tolerated dose is 360 mg once daily. PK 
demonstrates dose proportionality (120 mg-480 mg), a half-life of approximately 
75 hours, and no fulvestrant interaction. In dose escalation, one partial 
response (PR) is identified with disease control rate of 53% (19/36) and 
reduction of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, a substrate of CDK7, in 
circulating lymphocytes and tumor tissue. In TNBC expansion, one PR (duration 
337 days) and clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks (CBR) of 20.0% (4/20) is 
achieved. In combination with fulvestrant, 3 patients achieve PR with CBR 36.0% 
(9/25); in patients without detectable TP53-mutation CBR is 47.4% (9/19). In 
this study, samuraciclib exhibits tolerable safety and PK is supportive of 
once-daily oral administration. Clinical activity in TNBC and HR+/HER2-breast 
cancer post-CDK4/6-inhibitor settings warrants further evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have tumor protein 
p53 (TP53) mutations or a complex karyotype have a poor prognosis, and 
hypomethylating agents are often used. The authors evaluated the efficacy of 
entospletinib, an oral inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase, combined with 
decitabine in this patient population.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 substudy of the Beat AML 
Master Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03013998) using a Simon two-stage 
design. Eligible patients aged 60 years or older who had newly diagnosed AML 
with mutations in TP53 with or without a complex karyotype (cohort A; n = 45) or 
had a complex karyotype without TP53 mutation (cohort B; n = 13) received 
entospletinib 400 mg twice daily with decitabine 20 mg/m2 on days 1-10 every 
28 days for up to three induction cycles, followed by up to 11 consolidation 
cycles, in which decitabine was reduced to days 1-5. Entospletinib maintenance 
was given for up to 2 years. The primary end point was complete remission (CR) 
and CR with hematologic improvement by up to six cycles of therapy.
RESULTS: The composite CR rates for cohorts A and B were 13.3% (95% confidence 
interval, 5.1%-26.8%) and 30.8% (95% confidence interval, 9.1%-61.4%), 
respectively. The median duration of response was 7.6 and 8.2 months, 
respectively, and the median overall survival was 6.5 and 11.5 months, 
respectively. The study was stopped because the futility boundary was crossed in 
both cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of entospletinib and decitabine demonstrated 
activity and was acceptably tolerated in this patient population; however, the 
CR rates were low, and overall survival was short. Novel treatment strategies 
for older patients with TP53 mutations and complex karyotype remain an urgent 
need.

AIM: To compare the efficacies of exemestane and fulvestrant as first-line 
monotherapies for postmenopausal Chinese women having advanced 
oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+)/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-breast cancer (ER+/HER2- ABC) after a previous treatment for ≥2 years 
with an adjuvant non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor.
METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, multi-centre, parallel-controlled phase 
2 FRIEND study, 145 postmenopausal ER+/HER2- ABC patients were assigned into 
fulvestrant (500 mg on days 0, 14 and 28, and then at every 28 ± 3 days, n = 77) 
and exemestane (25 mg/day, n = 67) groups. The primary outcome was 
progression-free survival (PFS), while the secondary outcomes were disease 
control rate, objective response rate, time to treatment failure, duration of 
response and overall survival. Exploratory end-points included gene 
mutation-related outcomes and safety.
RESULTS: Fulvestrant was superior to exemestane regarding median PFS times (8.5 
versus 5.6 months, p = 0.014, HR = 0.62, 95% confidence intervals: 0.42-0.91), 
objective response rates (19.5% versus 6.0%, p = 0.017) and time to treatment 
failure (8.4 versus 5.5 months, p = 0.008). The incidence of adverse or serious 
adverse events in the two groups was virtually identical. The most frequent 
mutations in 129 analysed patients were detected in the oestrogen receptor gene 
1 (ESR1) (18/14.0%), PIK3CA (40/31.0%) and TP53 (29/22.5%) genes. Fulvestrant 
produced significant longer PFS times compared to exemestane but only for 
patients with an ESR1-wild type (8.5 versus 5.8 months) (p = 0.035), although 
there was a similar trend also for the ESR1 mutation without statistical 
significance. All patients with c-MYC and BRCA2 mutations had longer PFS times 
in the fulvestrant versus the exemestane group (p = 0.049, p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant significantly increased overall PFS for ER+/HER2- ABC 
patients and was well tolerated.

PURPOSE: Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive endometrial cancers (ECs) are 
characterized by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and receptor tyrosine 
kinase (RTK)/RAS/β-catenin (CTNNB1) pathway alterations in approximately 90% and 
80% of cases, respectively. Extensive cross-talk between ER, PI3K, and 
RTK/RAS/CTNNB1 pathways leads to both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ER 
transcriptional activity as well as upregulation of cyclin D1 which, in complex 
with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), is a critical regulator 
of cell cycle progression and a key mediator of resistance to hormonal therapy. 
We hypothesized that the combination of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and 
CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib would demonstrate promising activity in this 
setting.
METHODS: We conducted a phase II, two-stage study of letrozole/abemaciclib in 
recurrent ER-positive EC. Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, no 
limit on prior therapies, and all EC histologies; prior hormonal therapy was 
allowed. Primary end points were objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 and 
progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.
RESULTS: At the data cutoff date (December 03, 2021), 30 patients (28 with 
endometrioid EC) initiated protocol therapy; 15 (50%) patients had prior 
hormonal therapy. There were nine total responses (eight confirmed), for an 
objective response rate of 30% (95% CI, 14.7 to 49.4), all in endometrioid 
adenocarcinomas. Median PFS was 9.1 months, PFS at 6 months was 55.6% (95% CI, 
35.1 to 72), and median duration of response was 7.4 months. Most common ≥ grade 
3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (20%) and anemia (17%). 
Responses were observed regardless of grade, prior hormonal therapy, mismatch 
repair, and progesterone receptor status. Exploratory tumor profiling revealed 
several mechanistically relevant candidate predictors of response (CTNNB1, KRAS, 
and CDKN2A mutations) or absence of response (TP53 mutations), which require 
independent validation.
CONCLUSION: Letrozole/abemaciclib demonstrated encouraging and durable evidence 
of activity in recurrent ER positive endometrioid EC.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in premenopausal women. 
Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the 
development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if 
antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that 
targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which 
are known to promote breast cancer formation.
METHODS: In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we 
studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual 
cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population 
who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from 
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the 
same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1-T2 cancers and 
healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same 
individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal 
breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed 
the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone 
and ulipristal acetate; n = 44).
RESULTS: Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle 
of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone 
signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, 
breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the 
mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal 
progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal 
progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant 
transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both 
the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast 
tissue of all control women and in 64% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These 
findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, 
ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone 
reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations 
in mitotic-age-responders.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for 
primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.

PURPOSE: To conduct an updated exploratory analysis of overall survival (OS) 
with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 months and evaluate the prognostic value 
of molecular analysis by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) were 
randomized 2:1 to receive palbociclib (125 mg orally/day; 3/1 week schedule) and 
fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or placebo and fulvestrant. This OS 
analysis was performed when 75% of enrolled patients died (393 events in 521 
randomized patients). ctDNA analysis was performed among patients who provided 
consent.
RESULTS: At the data cutoff (August 17, 2020), 258 and 135 deaths occurred in 
the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. The median OS [95% confidence 
interval (CI)] was 34.8 months (28.8-39.9) in the palbociclib group and 28.0 
months (23.5-33.8) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 
0.65-0.99). The 6-year OS rate (95% CI) was 19.1% (14.9-23.7) and 12.9% 
(8.0-19.1) in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. Favorable OS 
with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant was 
observed in most subgroups, particularly in patients with endocrine-sensitive 
disease, no prior chemotherapy for ABC and low circulating tumor fraction and 
regardless of ESR1, PIK3CA, or TP53 mutation status. No new safety signals were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinically meaningful improvement in OS associated with 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant was maintained with >6 years of follow-up in 
patients with HR+/HER2- ABC, supporting palbociclib plus fulvestrant as a 
standard of care in these patients.
