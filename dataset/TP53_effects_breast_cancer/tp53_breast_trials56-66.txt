PURPOSE: Alpelisib, a selective oral inhibitor of the class I PI3K catalytic 
subunit p110α, has shown synergistic antitumor activity with endocrine therapy 
against ER+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer cells. This phase Ib study evaluated 
alpelisib plus letrozole's safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity in 
patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-six patients received letrozole and alpelisib daily. 
Outcomes were assessed by standard solid-tumor phase I methods. Tumor blocks 
were collected for DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Alpelisib's maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with letrozole 
was 300 mg/d. Common drug-related adverse events included hyperglycemia, nausea, 
fatigue, diarrhea, and rash with dose-limiting toxicity occurring at 350 mg/d of 
alpelisib. The clinical benefit rate (lack of progression ≥6 months) was 35% 
(44% in patients with PIK3CA-mutated and 20% in PIK3CA wild-type tumors; 95% CI, 
17%-56%), including five objective responses. Of eight patients remaining on 
treatment ≥12 months, six had tumors with a PIK3CA mutation. Among evaluable 
tumors, those with FGFR1/2 amplification and KRAS and TP53 mutations did not 
derive clinical benefit. Overexpression of FGFR1 in ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast 
cancer cells attenuated the response to alpelisib in vitro CONCLUSIONS: The 
combination of letrozole and alpelisib was safe, with reversible toxicities. 
Clinical activity was observed independently of PIK3CA mutation status, although 
clinical benefit was seen in a higher proportion of patients with PIK3CA-mutated 
tumors. Phase II and III trials of alpelisib and endocrine therapy in patients 
with ER+ breast cancer are ongoing. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 26-34. ©2016 AACR.

We investigated the hypothesis that the varying treatment efficacy of adjuvant 
5-fluorouracil (5FU) in stage III colon cancer is linked to the TP53 mutational 
status. ABCSG-90 was a prospective randomized trial in which effect of adjuvant 
5FU was studied in stage III colon cancer patients. Tumor material of 70% of 
these patients (389/572) was available for analysis of the biomarker TP53 using 
a TP53-gene-specific Sanger sequencing protocol. Median follow-up was 88 months. 
TP53 mutation frequency was 33%. A significant interaction between TP53 status, 
outcomes and nodal category was found (P = 0.0095). In the N1 category, TP53 
wildtype patients had significantly better overall survival than TP53 mutated 
(81.0% vs. 62.0% overall survival at 5 years; HR = 2.131; 95% CI: 1.344-3.378; 
P = 0.0010). In the N2 category, the TP53 status did not affect survival 
(P = 0.4992). In TP53 wildtype patients, the prognostic significance of N 
category was significantly enhanced (P = 0.0002). In TP53 mutated patients, 
survival curves of N1 and N2 patients overlapped and nodal category was no 
longer prognostic. The biomarker TP53 independently predicted effect of adjuvant 
5FU in N1 colon cancer patients. TP53 was not predictive in N2 patients, in whom 
5FU is known to have no effect.

This trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety between epirubicin 
(E) and carboplatin (C) in combination with paclitaxel (P) and trastuzumab (H) 
in neoadjuvant setting. In 13 Chinese cancer centers, 100 patients with 
HER2-positive, locally advanced breast cancer were 1:1 randomized to receive 
medication as follows: trastuzumab and paclitaxel weekly combined with 
carboplatin weekly for PCH group, or epirubicin every 3 weeks for PEH group. 
Patients were given 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was 
pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, which was no significant difference in 
PCH and PEH regimen (39.1% vs. 48.8%; p=0.365). However, PEH regimen achieved 
higher pCR in luminal-B (HER2-poitive) subgroup (55.0% vs. 24.0%; p = 0.033), 
but not in ERBB2+ subgroup (42.9% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.355). PEH regimen showed a 
favorable efficacy in PIK3CA mutated subgroup (69.2% vs.23.5%, p=0.012). No 
significant difference was observed in the subgroup analysis of TP53 mutation 
status, PTEN expression, FCGR2A SNP and FCGR3A SNP. Both regimens as neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy achieve similar efficacy and safety. PEH might improve pCR rate, 
especially in the luminal-B subtype and PIK3CA mutation subtype. PEH is feasible 
and less likely to increase the incidence of acute cardiac events compared to 
PCH.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant 
treatment with carboplatin and eribulin in patients with early-stage triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC), and to explore biomarkers based on DNA and 
protein expression profiles as predictors of response. Patients with 
histologically confirmed early-stage TNBC received carboplatin AUC 6 iv every 
21 days, and eribulin 1.4 mg/m(2) day 1 and day 8 every 21 days for four cycles. 
The primary endpoint of the study was pathologic complete response (pCR), with 
secondary endpoints including clinical response and safety of the combination. 
Exploratory studies assessed DNA-based biomarkers [homologous recombination 
deficiency (HRD) score, and HR deficiency status (HRD score + BRCA1/BRCA2 
mutation status)], protein-based biomarkers (Ki67, TP53, androgen receptor, 
Cyclin E, CDK2, Cyclin D, CDK4, Pin1 and Smad3), and clinical pretreatment 
factors as predictors of pCR. 13/30 (43.3 %) patients enrolled in the study 
achieved pCR. 24 (80.0 %) had a clinical complete or partial response. The 
combination was safe with mostly grade 1 and 2 toxicities. HRD score 
(P = 0.0024) and HR deficiency status (P = 0.0012) significantly predicted pCR. 
Pretreatment cytoplasmic CDK2 was also associated with pCR (P = 0.021). 
Significant differences in pre- versus post-treatment expression levels of 
nuclear Cyclin D (P = 0.020), nuclear CDK4 (P = 0.0030), and nuclear Smad3 
(P = 0.015) were detected. The combination of carboplatin and eribulin is safe 
and efficacious in the treatment of early-stage TNBC. HRD score, HR deficiency 
status, and cytoplasmic CDK2 predicted pCR in this patient population.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating 
cancer cell proliferation, survival and sensitivity to chemotherapy. The 
potential application of using miRNAs to predict therapeutic response to cancer 
treatment holds high promise, but miRNAs with predictive value remain to be 
identified and underlying mechanisms have not been completely understood. Here, 
we show a strong correlation between miR-621 expression and chemosensitivity to 
paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PTX/CBP) regimen, an effective neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. High level of miR-621 predicts better 
response to PTX/CBP regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, 
who also tend to achieve pathological complete response. Ectopic overexpression 
of miR-621 promoted apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity to PTX and CBP both 
in cultured breast cancer cells and in xenograft tumor model. We further show 
that FBXO11 is a direct functional target of miR-621 and miR-621 level is 
negatively correlated with FBXO11 expression in breast cancer patients. Ectopic 
expression of FBXO11 attenuated increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells 
overexpressing miR-621 upon PTX or CBP treatment. Consistently, high FBXO11 
expression significantly correlated with poor survival in breast cancer 
patients. Mechanistically, we found in breast cancer cells FBXO11 interacts with 
p53 and promotes its neddylation, which suppressed the p53 transactivity. 
Accordingly, miR-621-dependent FBXO11 suppression enhanced p53 activity and 
increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutics. Taken 
together, our data suggest that miR-621 enhances chemosensitivity of breast 
cancer cells to PTX/CBP chemotherapy by suppressing FBXO11-dependent inhibition 
of p53. miR-621 may serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic 
target in breast cancer treatment.

Genomic analysis and protein expression assimilate triple-negative breast 
cancers (TNBC) with basal-like breast tumors. TNBCs, however, have proved to 
encompass also tumors with normal-like phenotype and known to have favorable 
prognosis and to respond to chemotherapy. In a recent paper, we have provided 
evidence that p53 status is able to subdivide TNBCs into two distinct subgroups 
with different outcome, and consistent with basal- and normal-like phenotypes. 
Based on this finding, we explored the contribution of p53 status in predicting 
the response to adjuvant CMF or CMF followed doxorubicin chemotherapy of a group 
of TNBC patients. Results indicated that TNBC patients with a p53-positive tumor 
had a shorter relapse-free and overall survival than patients carrying a 
p53-negative TNBC, corroborating our hypothesis about the relationship between 
TNBC phenotype (basal-like versus normal-like) and p53 status as predictor of 
response to anthracycline/CMF-based chemotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: Resistance to trastuzumab is a problem that remains to be solved in 
HER2-positive breast cancer. We aimed to characterize profiles of genetic and 
epigenetic alterations in cancer-related pathways in HER2-positive breast 
cancers, using biopsy tissue samples obtained from patients enrolled in a 
prospective neoadjuvant clinical trial.
METHODS: HER2-positive breast cancer tissue samples were collected and processed 
with the PAXgene Tissue System. A total of 24 breast cancers were analyzed. 
Genetic alterations of 409 cancer-related genes were analyzed by a bench-top 
next-generation sequencer. DNA methylation statuses were analyzed by a bead 
array with 485,512 probes.
RESULTS: The WNT pathway was potentially activated by aberrant methylation of 
its negative regulators, such as DKK3 and SFRP1, in 9 breast cancers. The 
AKT/mTOR pathway was activated by mutations of PIK3CA in 5 breast cancers. The 
Notch pathway was potentially activated by mutations of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in 4 
breast cancers. The p53 pathway was inactivated by mutations of TP53 in 13 
breast cancers and potentially by aberrant methylation of its downstream genes 
in 10 breast cancers. Cell adhesion was affected by mutations of CDH1 in 1 
breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Genes involved in cancer-related pathways were frequently affected 
not only by genetic but also by epigenetic alterations in HER2-positive breast 
cancer.

The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of the pathologic 
complete response (pCR) and near-complete pathologic response (npCR) between 
gene expression profiling using either the dataset of 150 genes as determined by 
BluePrint/MammaPrint versus PAM50 molecular subtyping. The samples were from 
patients with operable early-stage breast cancer prior to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy of capecitabine plus docetaxel, with or without trastuzumab. 
Molecular subtyping data were analyzed on samples from 122 patients enrolled in 
XeNA neoadjuvant trial. The biopsies were obtained as part of the original study 
where PAM50 assay was performed using custom-designed full genome 44,000 feature 
Agilent microarrays, and TP53 mutational analysis was performed on pretreatment 
tumor tissue using the AmpliChip TP53 assay. For the current study, clinical and 
pathological endpoints, TP53 mutation analysis and PAM50 results were collected 
through GEO at NCBI (GSE22358). MammaPrint and BluePrint outcomes were 
determined from the available gene expression data. The overall pCR plus npCR 
rate was 25% (30/122). Stratified by BluePrint/MammaPrint, patients of HER2 type 
had the best response (59%), while luminal A (7%) and B (9%) subtypes had the 
poorest. The pCR plus npCR rate in patients classified with PAM50 assay was 76% 
in HER2 type, 10% in luminal A type, and 5% in luminal B type. The pCR plus npCR 
rate [22/61 (36%)] among TP53-mutated patients was significantly higher than 
TP53 wild-type patients [7/54 (13%); P=0.012]. Concordance of 
BluePrint/MammaPrint with PAM50 molecular subtyping was only 59%. Regardless of 
the molecular subtype, for patient samples with concordant BluePrint/MammaPrint 
and PAM50 data, the pCR plus npCR rate in TP53 mutant samples was 17/39 (44%), 
whereas in patients whose tumors were TP53 wild type, it was 5/31 (16%). 
Molecular and intrinsic subtyping may provide predictive information for 
patients treated with docetaxel plus capecitabine±trastuzumab preoperatively, 
and these results need to be further evaluated. The differences between the two 
methodologies need clarification in a prospective manner and being compared to 
the standard IHC-FISH testing.

BACKGROUND: Plasma-derived cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) constitutes a potential 
surrogate for tumor DNA obtained from tissue biopsies. We posit that massively 
parallel sequencing (MPS) analysis of ctDNA may help define the repertoire of 
mutations in breast cancer and monitor tumor somatic alterations during the 
course of targeted therapy.
PATIENT AND METHODS: A 66-year-old patient presented with synchronous estrogen 
receptor-positive/HER2-negative, highly proliferative, grade 2, mixed invasive 
ductal-lobular carcinoma with bone and liver metastases at diagnosis. DNA 
extracted from archival tumor material, plasma and peripheral blood leukocytes 
was subjected to targeted MPS using a platform comprising 300 cancer genes known 
to harbor actionable mutations. Multiple plasma samples were collected during 
the fourth line of treatment with an AKT inhibitor.
RESULTS: Average read depths of 287x were obtained from the archival primary 
tumor, 139x from the liver metastasis and between 200x and 900x from ctDNA 
samples. Sixteen somatic non-synonymous mutations were detected in the liver 
metastasis, of which 9 (CDKN2A, AKT1, TP53, JAK3, TSC1, NF1, CDH1, MML3 and 
CTNNB1) were also detected in >5% of the alleles found in the primary tumor 
sample. Not all mutations identified in the metastasis were reliably identified 
in the primary tumor (e.g. FLT4). Analysis of ctDNA, nevertheless, captured all 
mutations present in the primary tumor and/or liver metastasis. In the 
longitudinal monitoring of the patient, the mutant allele fractions identified 
in ctDNA samples varied over time and mirrored the pharmacodynamic response to 
the targeted therapy as assessed by positron emission tomography-computed 
tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle study is one of the first to demonstrate 
that high-depth targeted MPS of plasma-derived ctDNA constitutes a potential 
tool for de novo mutation identification and monitoring of somatic genetic 
alterations during the course of targeted therapy, and may be employed to 
overcome the challenges posed by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity.

PURPOSE: Endocrine therapies include aromatase inhibitors and the selective 
estrogen receptor (ER) downregulator fulvestrant. This study aimed to determine 
whether the reported efficacy of fulvestrant over anastrozole, and high- over 
low-dose fulvestrant, reflect distinct transcriptional responses.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global gene expression profiles from ERα-positive breast 
carcinomas before and during presurgical treatment with fulvestrant (n = 22) or 
anastrozole (n = 81), and corresponding in vitro models, were compared. 
Transcripts responding differently to fulvestrant and estrogen deprivation were 
identified and integrated using Gene Ontology, pathway and network analyses to 
evaluate their potential significance.
RESULTS: The overall transcriptional response to fulvestrant and estrogen 
deprivation was correlated (r = 0.61 in presurgical studies, r = 0.87 in vitro), 
involving downregulation of estrogen-regulated and proliferation-associated 
genes. The transcriptional response to fulvestrant was of greater magnitude than 
estrogen deprivation (slope = 0.62 in presurgical studies, slope = 0.63 in 
vitro). Comparative analyses identified 28 genes and 40 Gene Ontology categories 
affected differentially by fulvestrant. Seventeen fulvestrant-specific genes, 
including CAV1/2, SNAI2, and NRP1, associated with ERα, androgen receptor (AR), 
and TP53, in a network regulating cell cycle, death, survival, and tumor 
morphology. Eighteen genes responding differently to fulvestrant specifically 
predicted antiproliferative response to fulvestrant, but not anastrozole. 
Transcriptional effects of low-dose fulvestrant correlated with high-dose 
treatment, but were of lower magnitude (ratio = 0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional response to fulvestrant has much in common with 
estrogen deprivation, but is stronger with distinctions potentially attributable 
to arrest of estrogen-independent ERα activity and involvement of AR signaling. 
Genes responding differently to fulvestrant may have predictive utility. These 
data are consistent with the clinical efficacy of fulvestrant versus anastrozole 
and higher dosing regimens.

BACKGROUND: Pathological complete response (pCR) following chemotherapy is 
strongly associated with both breast cancer subtype and long-term survival. 
Within a phase III neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial, we sought to determine 
whether the prognostic implications of pCR, TP53 status and treatment arm 
(taxane versus non-taxane) differed between intrinsic subtypes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either six cycles of 
anthracycline-based chemotherapy or three cycles of docetaxel then three cycles 
of eprirubicin/docetaxel (T-ET). pCR was defined as no evidence of residual 
invasive cancer (or very few scattered tumour cells) in primary tumour and lymph 
nodes. We used a simplified intrinsic subtypes classification, as suggested by 
the 2011 St Gallen consensus. Interactions between pCR, TP53 status, treatment 
arm and intrinsic subtype on event-free survival (EFS), distant metastasis-free 
survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS) were studied using a landmark and a 
two-step approach multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Sufficient data for pCR analyses were available in 1212 (65%) of 1856 
patients randomized. pCR occurred in 222 of 1212 (18%) patients: 37 of 496 
(7.5%) luminal A, 22 of 147 (15%) luminal B/HER2 negative, 51 of 230 (22%) 
luminal B/HER2 positive, 43 of 118 (36%) HER2 positive/non-luminal, 69 of 
221(31%) triple negative (TN). The prognostic effect of pCR on EFS did not 
differ between subtypes and was an independent predictor for better EFS [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 0.40, P < 0.001 in favour of pCR], DMFS (HR = 0.32, P < 0.001) and 
OS (HR = 0.32, P < 0.001). Chemotherapy arm was an independent predictor only 
for EFS (HR = 0.73, P = 0.004 in favour of T-ET). The interaction between TP53, 
intrinsic subtypes and survival outcomes only approached statistical 
significance for EFS (P = 0.1).
CONCLUSIONS: pCR is an independent predictor of favourable clinical outcomes in 
all molecular subtypes in a two-step multivariate analysis.
