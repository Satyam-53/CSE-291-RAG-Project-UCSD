                      "The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to induce cell death, including apoptosis, through transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. ",
                      "Nuclear p53 transcriptionally activates the expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such as NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAD, BIK, BAX, etc., whereas it inactivates the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. ",
                      "On the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria.",
                      "Recently, we identified SEPT4/ARTS as a p53-responsive gene that plays a critical role in p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis.",
                      "ARTS facilitates p53 translocation to the mitochondria and increases the interaction of p53 with BCL-XL, consequently leading to inhibition of BCL-XL and augmented apoptosis.",
                      "Curcumin has anticancer functions in various tumors. It has been shown to induce apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways.",
                      "To understand the p73-dependent mechanisms that are engaged during curcumin-induced apoptosis, we established a p73 overexpression cell model using p53-deficient Hep3B cells.",
                      "Our results demonstrated that curcumin at concentrations of 40 and 80 ?M induced DNA damage, increased TAp73/DNp73 ratio, and also led to apoptosis in the Hep3BTAp73/DNp73 cells.",
                      "p73, a p53 family member, can also induce apoptosis and regulate the cell cycle.",
                      "The apoptotic cell death was concurrent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). ",
                      "These results demonstrated a p73-dependent mechanism for curcumin-induced apoptosis that involves the mitochondria-mediated pathway.",
                      "curcumin-induced DNA damage caused increase of TAp73 levels but decrease of DNp73 protein levels, resulting in the increase of TAp73/DNp73 ratio.",
                      "These results, combined with the disruption of MMP; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and cleavage of pro-caspase 9, pro-caspase 3, and pro-PARP, indicate that the increased DNA damage contributes to the induction of mitochondria-associated apoptosis via a p73-dependent pathway."
