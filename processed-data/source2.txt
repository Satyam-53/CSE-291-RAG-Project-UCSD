Mutagenesis studies are an important clinical tool used to assess TP53 variant pathogenicity, however, it is often unclear without sub-
stantial clinical evidence that is difficult to obtain from predominantly rare and infrequent variants. The results from large-scale mutagenesis
experiments have demonstrated a broad range of functional consequences associated with different variants, ranging from near wild-type (WT) TP53 capabilities to severe loss-of-function (LOF)13–15. As amultifaceted protein, TP53 is composed of several domains containing complex structured and unstructured regions that enable a myriad of cellular tasks. Primarily operating as a transcription factor, TP53 binds to DNA recognition sequences as a tetramer and regulates the expression of several thousand target genes to orchestrate cellular responses centering around DNA-damage repair (DDR) and cell fate decisions. Hence, variants arising at different locations of the protein can impart different cellular consequences by altering its transcriptional activity (TA) as well as its non-TA. Some variant TP53 species can also exert a dominant-negative (DN) effect over WT TP5317,18. This is an important feature because LFS and germline TP53-related cancer predisposition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and most patients are heterozygous carriers who retain one copy of WT TP53. Moreover, TP53 variant LOF can vary under different cellular conditions. For example, the R337H variant—the most frequently reported germline variant due to a genetic founder event in Brazil — has a conditional pH-dependent LOF and is associated with the tissue - specific development of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)19,20. Thus, the functional assessments derived from comprehensive variant library screens conducted in varying cellular contexts provide clinically relevant measurements of specific TP53 activities. Here, we incorporated TP53 variant library screens using an unsupervised cluster analysis and uncovered five functionally distinct variant clusters (Fig. 1). When applied to germline variant carriers from the NCI TP53 Database and a validation dataset, we identified unique cancer patterns and significant differences between ages at cancer diagnosis. Additionally, assessment of var ants in cancer cell lines and primary patient-derived healthy skin and blood samples recapitulated the clinical observations. Our variant clustering model provides a classification tool for the risk stratification and consideration for variant interpretation of TP53 variant carriers.
